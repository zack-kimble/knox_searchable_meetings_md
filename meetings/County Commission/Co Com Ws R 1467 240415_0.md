| 0:01:54| now with the Pledge of Allegiance by Commissioner Beeler. Thank you Madam Chair. Please stand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| salute our nation's flag and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=119)|
| 0:02:08| of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=128)|
| 0:02:26| Thank you. Moving on to amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| Pardon? Could I have a moment for a second? Thank you for reminding me. Thank you very much. I'm going to turn the floor over for just a moment to Commissioner Jay to bring us some unhappy news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=149)|
| 0:02:51| Thank you Madam Chair. As many of you may know by this point, one of our colleagues on City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| Councilman Andrew Roberto and his family lost their oldest daughter last night who was killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| in a tragic car accident in the wee hours of the evening in far west Knoxville. She was 21 years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=184)|
| 0:03:12| and as I thought about that today I was reminded that in the English language we have words to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=192)|
| 0:03:21| describe those who have lost loved ones. We talk about orphans who have lost their parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| widows or widowers that have lost a spouse but there is no word for the overwhelming grief a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| parent experiences over the death of a child. There's no word to describe that in English| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| language and I think we can understand why. I can't imagine the pain that they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| through. So as we grieve with and we pray for the Roberto family, I would just ask this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| to observe a moment of silence in memory of Kylie Roberto. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=228)|
| 0:03:57| Thank you for that Commissioner Jay. I appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=237)|

| 0:06:11| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| We have no presentations on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| We have three people signed up for a public forum related directly to our agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=376)|
| 0:06:25| Since we only have three and this is a pretty big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| issue, I'll allow each speaker five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Kevin Murphy, you're first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| After Kevin is Herb Anders and then Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| When you come forward, say your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you, Madam Chairman. Kevin Murphy, 450 Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| This is related to item 20, the comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| And first of all, I'd like to thank all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| I'd like to thank the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| I'd like to thank all the bodies that have been sticking with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| I'd like to thank the public for their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| And especially the staff have really dealt with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| thousands of different public inputs and consultants and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| So thank you to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Our coalition of advocates supports planning that balances our growing population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| with our natural beauty and agrarian traditions of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Striking that balance is really at the heart of the advanced Knox plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| And we need development that flows towards some area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| and deflect it from flowing into other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| Two things I'd like to address today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| One is rural place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| which are overlaid on much of our remaining undeveloped land in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| And that's where, that would be an area where we think we need to kind of deflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| the development away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Our farms, natural areas, and urban proximity to these spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| are character defining for our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| This is, you know, that's our connection to our rural roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| And that's why many of us choose to live, work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| and raise our families here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| But we're losing those lands rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| Tennessee's losing about 90,000 acres a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| That's, or 90,000 acres, yeah, a year of agriculture and forestry land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| Over a five year period, that's been two counties worth over the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| And that's an acceleration from the last 20 years was when it was about one county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| So we're accelerating our loss of farmland in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| I really want to talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| some of the proposed densities that go into these rural place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Two units an acre we don't think is terribly rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| When you look and show pictures of that to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| they say, oh, that's, you know, we looked and we found some pictures of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| and we show them to people and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| well, that doesn't look very rural to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| That looks suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| And that's a, you know, that's pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| So, you know, we've, you know, so we think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| the character, you know, allowing up to two units, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| is probably not quite in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| More importantly, too, is that density isn't a deterrent to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| It doesn't, like, get, you know, development to flow away from the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| You have a zoning request on Roberts Road this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| where the applicant told the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| they can make two units an acre work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| You know, that's what they thought they were going to get when they bought the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| So this is out in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| They're looking at two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| That's what they're expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| And so while they may not love it, they can make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| And if they can make it work, we're going to continue to see them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| acquire more of that land out in the rural area to, you know, to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| And that land, that density is the most fiscally costly to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| So that's what we want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| We're really at an inflection point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| It's, we want to think with a long-term horizon here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| You know, if we don't have strong protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| for our remaining rural areas in character, we will lose that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| I saw the TPO just is, they're updating their population projections now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| And through 2050, so the next 26 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| they're projecting the county's population to increase by 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| So we're going to add 20% more people that want food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| And at the same time, we're going to be losing the land that creates that food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| So that's, you know, our groups looked at other counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| and outside of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| When we see counties that are looking at rural protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| what we actually see them look at is more like one unit every five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| So, you know, much, much less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Our coalition, we've talked, we've got former planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| and we've got a lot of folks that's looked at this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| We would really like to see it drop down to more like one unit per two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| as a good start for really trying to protect our rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| So, I want to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Many Knox County residents in the rural area have lived there for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| They've chosen to invest and build in those rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| And the desires of those residents have, you know, weight and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| just as the desires of people moving to relocate to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| So I'd like you to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Our next speaker is Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| My name is Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| I reside in the Ruggles Ferry community of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| And I would also like to thank the staff and everyone that I've had opportunity to speak with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| from the commissioners to the staff and other folks concerning the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| And I really appreciate the dialogue we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| And I feel like that the community has been listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| And my comments, we have some other concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| So, I'm representing the Ruggles Ferry community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And I am a former planning commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And I'm representing the thinking of at least four of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| and many people in our community in Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| I would like to talk about the rural living place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| which is found in the rural area of the county and in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| In fact, there's a lot of it in my community, the Ruggles Ferry community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| When you look at rural living place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| the descriptions and pictures, you see houses on larger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| houses associated with farms and open land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| These houses have many times been there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| And they're built in the architectural style that you would expect to see in a rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Sometimes there are new houses interspersed with the older homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| And but they also sit on larger lots, larger pieces of lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| So, my point is that there is a large variety of types of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| and the architectural features of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| And it'll go anywhere from a manufactured home to an estate style home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| You see it all in a rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| And I think that's something that most folks expect to see in a rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| What you don't see in the place types are pictures of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| You don't see the entire developments where the houses are built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| with a few floor plans reversed, different type siding, different features on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| But it's basically the same home and oftentimes very, very close to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| This is the type of development we see just about in every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| in a planned residential zone in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| And it doesn't fit the rural character of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| not just the Ruggles Ferry community, anywhere in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| And I refer back to the 2012 East Knox Community Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| where there were indicated that the consideration should be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=826)|
| 0:13:55| in all considerations of planning to preserve the rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| of East Knox County in the French Broad and Holston River corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| The rural living place type has three other zones directly related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Estate zone, agriculture zone, and rural preservation zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| Almost all of the land in the rural living place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| has agriculture zone underneath it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| so the underlying zoning is aligned with the place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| We ask that the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| as a partially related zone in the rural living place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| be removed from the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| The current planned residential ordinance and standards deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| build-outs that simply don't fit the character of rural living place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Perhaps when the UDO is updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| there will be a new planned zone that is a better fit for the style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| But today's planned residential zone isn't a good fit for the rural community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| and I am asking that that be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| and help preserve the rural character of not only the Ruggles Ferry community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| but the portions of East Knox County that have that character of rural preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| And our final speaker, Lisa Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| Lisa Starbuck, 6233 Babeley Road, Enrita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you, commissioners, for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| With the 4,900 acres of planned growth expansion in Enrita and Maloneyville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| we are on notice that the county intends to build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| its infrastructure and services in northeast Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| This area is still very rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| There's a lot of beautiful open land with great views of House Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| and many small and mid-sized farms scattered in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| The residents, many of whom have been here for generations, have stewarded this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| The proposed future land use map designates a lot of suburban residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| rural conservation in this area, which will accommodate a lot of new dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| At two units per acre, think of Holston Hills or Alice Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| That's what that's zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| That doesn't look very rural to me or to most of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| It also proposes a large traditional neighborhood development right at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| the furthest extent of Washington Pike, up against the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| We don't yet have the infrastructure or even the plan for the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| We know we need a mobility plan or small area plan completed for these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| We will need new parks, new schools, more emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| plans for utilities, and especially road infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| Throughout all of this, we have pointed to Hardin Valley as the example of how not to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| where you develop first, then come in later with infrastructure and try to play catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| We implore you not to do that to northeast Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| We request that you modify the future land use plan in the expanded plan growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| Use the rural living place type in this area with its reduced densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and then once the small area plans are complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| you will know what infrastructure is needed and the timing of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| And then you can update the future land use map accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| and add in the appropriate place types at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| We are on notice that this is in the county's 20-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| But for once, you have the opportunity to look at the big picture over a long time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| You can phase in the development with the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| So please do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| I would like to take a minute to shout out to Commissioner Kim Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| who has invested a tremendous amount of time, energy, effort, blood, sweat, and tears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| in trying to make this plan workable for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| She has gone above and beyond working with staff, the mayor's office, and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| And I know she has spent countless hours reading, revising, planning, negotiating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| and worrying over this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| So thank you, Commissioner Frazier, for your dedication to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| I also want to especially thank Commissioner Richie Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| our 8th District Commissioner, who represents Northeast Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| where the bulk of these changes will take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| for listening to the community and being willing to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| and ensure that the plan protects the rural character of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Again, I urge you to modify the future land use plan in the expanded planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| and use the rural living place type to contain the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1158)|

| 0:21:11| if there's a representative from the Engineering and Public Works Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| that could answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1274)|
| 0:21:25| Yes, sir, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Jim Snowden, Knox County, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Botsford Drive is in the Kensington subdivision and looking at the records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| that street was accepted the final plat in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| and the names for that subdivision were approved in January of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| How is it that from 2005 to 2024, we're just now accepting that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| There, if I'm not mistaken, that one is one that was owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| pretty much all the adjoining lots were owned by the Shuberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| The Shuberts chose not to build on them for a very long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| We obviously don't want to accept those roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| until a lot of that construction traffic has completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| and make sure that that road hasn't any failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| I think the Shuberts did a combination of selling the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| as well as building them out after the, you know, the 07-08 crash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| and have now completed all the homes on that street or at least the bulk of the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| and we feel like it's safe to accept them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| But I think from my understanding and recollection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| we waited on accepting them to make sure that all the construction traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| that would be on the roadway didn't create any damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| so that we could have the contractor fix it should there be any damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Okay, so did Knox County inspect it back in 2006 when the roads were put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1376)|
| 0:22:56| We did inspect it during construction as well as prior to the acceptance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Prior to submitting this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| And have they, did the developer pave the road prior to us accepting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| Yes, everything is complete for the dedication to come in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1395)|

| 0:24:58| Motion by Jay, second by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I pulled this off of consent and spoke with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| There just was no fiscal note attached to it or in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| but after discussion, it's not a separate expense and there's no additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Essentially, the cost of this is built into the rental cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| that is tied to the contract we approved in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| It's part of the pre-trial release program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| so I'm satisfied with it and happy to approve it moving forward on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1533)|

| 0:25:49| Can we move item 20 to the rear so these other people that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| can go do their business and maybe go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| because I think item 20 is going to be a long discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1558)|
| 0:26:06| There's no use making all these stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I know y'all want to stay here to listen to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1568)|

| 0:26:12| but I'd like to move item 20 to the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1580)|

| 0:27:42| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Yeah, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I just wanted to see if who was going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Chris Colwell, are you going to discuss it this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| or are we going to do it next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| I believe they have a presentation scheduled for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Okay, I just wanted to double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| I didn't see that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| We have a motion and second on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1682)|

| 0:28:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1689)|

| 0:28:12| Item number 36, Resolution 903 to increase the membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1692)|

| 0:28:19| through the addition of a second county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| serving in an at-large seat and a management representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| of the EMS ambulance provider under the contract to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Motion by Daly, second by Schoonmaker to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Do we have any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Mr. Seymour is here and Jenny's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| So Mr. Seymour, will you come up and fill us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| what we did Wednesday and the good suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| for the Fire and Rescue Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1742)|
| 0:29:02| Brent Seymour, Public Safety Director, 1630 Huron, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| So essentially what we'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| is add an at-large commission seat to our committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| Commissioner Daly's a rock star on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| Very informative, very educated to everything we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| fire and technical rescue wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| One of the reasons we wanted to add the at-large commission seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| was we feel like that would also be a good addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| was we feel like that would also give better representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| for the total constituency across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| instead of just having a single district represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| on the committee itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| The contracted provider seat, essentially what that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| is that allows our fire chiefs and our rescue chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| to have a point of contact and a familiar face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| with our EMS provider on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| in case I'll give you a four example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Other issues obviously can be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| but this was one I thought about a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| So say we do CPR on a patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| The event is tragic and we get a pulse back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| and that patient begins to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| As a firefighter, first responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| we load that person in the medic unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| The medic unit drives away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Predominantly, the majority of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| we never hear any out course of that patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| and this was one of the examples I thought of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| when I was trying to, what a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| an EMS representative could do for us at the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| So our current EMS provider has a data person in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| who tracks those critical patients through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Obviously, our staffing on the fire side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| doesn't allow us to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| and with the HIPAA laws and everything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| it's really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| I mean, back in the day when I was on the medic unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| we had enough contacts in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| that I could call and ask someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| hey, how did Ms. Smith do or what is her progress now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| What's her status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| And most of the time, they would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| because you knew and you built a rapport with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| That just doesn't happen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| So although the event's tragic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| the example is kind of simplistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| With our EMS provider, they have someone in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| tracking those patients through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| We may know that that patient spent a month in the unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| and walked out of the ER or they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| and that allows us to maybe adjust some training protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| We can look at some patient outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| and some assessments and do what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| to provide better care for the folks in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| We also discussed a name change at our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| and I think it, I like fire, EMS and rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| but we will probably have to bring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| before this commission to change the committee name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| So we'll just be discussing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| and I always thought EMS ought to be on there anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| and I'm glad EMS is added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| And next month, we're going to have a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| on the first three months of the new ambulance contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| Will that be under you or under health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| So you'll have a couple of reports next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| You'll have the fire and technical rescue committee report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| You'll have the EMS report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| which I believe will be delivered by the provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1937)|
| 0:32:17| Is that correct, Ms. Holden, the provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| And then there may be one more report on there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| I thought there were three that we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| but we elected to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Typically, mine would be this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| but we kind of elected to bump that back a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| so you would get all three set of statistics at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=1951)|

| 0:39:12| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Frazier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2355)|

| 0:39:18| It was direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Commissioner Hill, I made the motion and Commissioner Frazier was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Motion made by Durrett, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Commissioner Frazier, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| You all have a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| We'll be going through this just item by item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| I first wanted to, again, thank Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I have gone to several administrations over the last 10, 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| and talked about updating our plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| and he was the only one that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| this is a big undertaking, but it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| So, I want to thank him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| I want to thank Director Snowden, Director Benedict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| Director Brooks, Kathy Olson, Allie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| They have just shown incredible leadership and guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| and dedication through this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| And it really has been a collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| And for me, it's a great privilege to get to work with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| on something that I really believe is transformative for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| The administration, the leadership team, and I think we as commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| I think we all have the same goal in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| and that's to create a sustainable, balanced growth and transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| that will restore the integrity of our land use policies and processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| The final product, it won't be perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| and it will most likely change a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| as we work through the UDO and small area studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| but it is a great improvement from where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Being an at-large commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| it really has gifted me with some really unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| and sometimes opposing perspectives on how we should grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| and I've really tried really hard to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| all those perspectives in my suggested amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Because really, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| it is up to us to put into practice really informed and good decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| and that starts with really good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| So with that, I'm going to kind of dive in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| I've put the discussion items into two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| The first consists of text or language amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| The second are discussion items that I felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| there will probably be a little bit more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| from this body as well as from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| And so I'm going to just begin with the suggested text and language amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| and go through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I do want to make it clear that I have shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| and discussed all of these with the leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| This is not the final version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| There were probably seven or eight just communicating back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| and also working with community groups across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| and just trying to listen and see where we can just make a couple of tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| These guys are the professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| I respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| I respect this process, the integrity of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| So I really want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| First off is page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| It's small area and corridor plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| I feel like this is where we can reference the transportation impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| by adding just some simple language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| It would read existing plans and guidelines that remain in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| include transportation impact analysis guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| comma, east county community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| So you have there in the blue text, that's existing language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Red are the suggested amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| So that is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| And I'll just go through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| I don't know if the body wants to comment on each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| or if you just want to kind of stop me if you have a question or comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| All right, we'll take a minute after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| So that's the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| And you are referring to page two of our major document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| that we've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| It's under small area and corridor plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| During the presentation we had in March on the comprehensive land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I had requested that you guys add the Fox Road corridor study to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| Has that been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| It has not been added yet, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Will it be added before next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| If you all would like to add it, that's something that can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| I did flag it for colleagues in engineering public works as well to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| to make sure that nothing that it was still a plan that was relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| and hadn't had anything adopted to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| Okay, because they have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2653)|
| 0:44:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Also on page two under facility plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| I would like to suggest adding hillside and ridgetop protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| because this is a plan that is routinely referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| And I think that it has merit of being added here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| So the text would simply read in the kind of the plans that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2673)|
| 0:44:41| It would just be in addition after Greenway corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| comma, and hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Seeing none, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2698)|
| 0:44:58| Page 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Rural living under the land use mix primary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| I suggest adding language to read residential, comma, single family detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2703)|
| 0:45:21| Seeing no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Commissioner Beeler, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Just to be sure I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| the current is single family on a wide range of lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| No, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| If you look under land use mix primary uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| where it says residential, comma, single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| the suggestion is just to add detached following single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| All right, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| You said on page 37?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2766)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Commissioner Frazier, could you just explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| could you give me some more context as to why you suggested that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Historically, the primary uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| in an area that would be under the place type of rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| we would want those to be single family detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| You would not want townhomes, condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| things that would distract from the rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| and heritage of the rural living place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Okay, page 38, rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| I have one question on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| In-law suites, are those allowed under this then or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Would that be, or like help on a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| if there was a bunkhouse or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| I would have to do defer to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| Would you repeat your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Would what be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| If there was a bunkhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| would what be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| If there was, so you're saying that they have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| only in single, non, single detached housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| So would an in-law suite, a second apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| be allowed under that term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| I would think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2847)|
| 0:47:27| Or would there be a bunkhouse on like a main house allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| if it was like a farm situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| It's a good question, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| I believe the bunkhouse probably would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| It'd be almost like a second dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| But I think we might have a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| with the mother-in-law's quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| That potentially might be an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| It essentially would serve almost like a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| And I think in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| that might be prohibited with this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| Okay, I like my grandma a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| So if we could make an in-law suite something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| I would think a lot of people like their grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| and their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| So I know that I'm not putting my mom in an old folks home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| that she'll come live with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| So that's one thing that I would like to see addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| Commissioner Ward, do you have any suggested language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| to replace this with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| I'm not a lawyer, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| I don't know legal terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| I'm kind of an idiot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| So I would probably refer to somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| that's more advanced in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| If you would, Commissioner Beckett speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| So Commissioner Ward, just to be clear then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| you want that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| Are you asking then in the essence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| I'm saying if we put this language in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| we're eliminating that possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| for rural residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| So take the example that you have a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| and the farm next door is your relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| and they can't care for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| So you want to bring them into your place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| and build on an in-law suite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| is the best way I know how to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| The house would then be considered a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| under those circumstances and you couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Or somebody moves from the county over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| to county or state over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2968)|
| 0:49:28| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I was just going to offer up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| that we could come up with some proposed language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| before you all take a vote on this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Also note that accessory dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| is something that could be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| during the Unified Development Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| and could be something that could be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| in all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| But that would need further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2990)|
| 0:49:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Any other discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Oh, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Could this potentially evolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| into an Airbnb situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| if you have an auxiliary structure like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| in a rural environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Mr. Snowden, if this mother-in-law...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| People will go pull a permit for a garage apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| and their intent is all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| is running a business out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| They'll build a building that's 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| 7,000 of it is to run their repair business or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| and have a very small lot or small room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| And it gets by codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| which we need to fix that somehow, some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| It needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| The question is, if I own that one acre lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| or whatever that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| will I have to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3065)|
| 0:51:05| When I come to codes to get a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| is that something that would have to go to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| to get a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Or I don't want to get into a variance situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| It depends on the intensity of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| The garage apartment essentially is another dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| so then it would fall back to what's the intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| of use allowed within that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| So it would depend, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| Because we've had that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| and I think it's going to vary per zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| I see a lot of danger there if it goes to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| If they ask for a variance at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| which seems to be granted way too often on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| So I have a concern as Director of BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| and I have a concern as Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| if we could put something in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| So I don't know if we can put some language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| that restricts it going to BZA or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| But you understand my concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| That is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3128)|

| 0:52:09| Commissioner, BZA cannot grant a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| to allow a use that's not otherwise allowed in a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| So it would have to be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| that was allowed in that zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| as a member of the UDO or part of the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| If, for example, if we left it at single family detached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| somebody couldn't go to the BZA and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| well, I want to add a mother-in-law apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| They don't have that power, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| And I would not let them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Variances are not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| They cannot be given to allow uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| that are otherwise not allowed in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Well, I've watched you and I appreciate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| but a lot of times they don't listen to your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| Enough on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| Commissioner Durant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| This would not, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| prohibit an addition to the existing single dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| for, say, a mother-in-law suite or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| Are there any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| This is under rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| the potential of two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| If they already have two units on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Madam Chair, you're referring to the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Allows for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| This is a rural living place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| I apologize, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| And so you would need to refer to the zonings allowed for densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| I do see I'm in the wrong rural category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3249)|
| 0:54:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Page 38, rural conservation under housing mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| I'm suggesting adding language to the bullet point to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| single family residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| shall be clustered in a pattern that preserves 50% or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| open space or environmentally sensitive areas on a given site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| I'm including environmentally sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| because they're later discussed in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| and they're also discussed in the PR zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| So this just simply includes that language to tie those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| Is there any discussion, questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| I was just wondering where that is defined later in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| I think the definition of what is an environmentally sensitive area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| or maybe that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| We'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Or maybe Mr. Snowden could outline what determines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3305)|
| 0:55:16| an environmentally sensitive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Um, I'm sorry Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| We should have included that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| It's Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| It's not defined in the plan, but you mention it in your request on page 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| That's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3341)|
| 0:55:41| I'm on page 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| So it's not in the plan currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| You're adding language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3351)|
| 0:55:51| Can we come back to that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| And again, these are all just for discussion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| And I encourage discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| So page 40, rural agriculture, add language to the last sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| of the place type description to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| These sites are found in the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| where prime and locally important soils may exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| and the road network is sparse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| And I think it's important that Knox County acknowledge an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| to be good stewards of prime and locally important soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| This was brought up during the coordinating committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| and this will be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| how this will be used will be determined in the UDO process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3392)|
| 0:56:41| Any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3401)|
| 0:56:41| I hate to ask the same question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| but I think these things matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| Is there a definition of what prime and locally important soils is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| I mean, I guess what I'm trying to get with a couple of these questions is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| is it an opinion or is there a definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| No, there's an actual definition of what identifies as prime and locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| And there's a map that also indicates where those soils can be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Is that in this plan or is that a separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| It's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Separate document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| Seeing no other lights, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3442)|

| 0:57:27| Add to the last sentence of the second paragraph to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| The plans also provide a forum to consider other elements of the built environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| like parks and open spaces and other public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| such as stormwater and utility needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| I'm proposing to add schools, historic resources, and conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| This would support the county's commitment to broaden the consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| and scope of impact of a project on an area during the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| Any discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| Seeing none, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3480)|

| 0:58:05| Suggest changing the last sentence to read the rezoning or development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| shall consider the suitability of existing or planned infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| This is just giving the plan a little bit more teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| Page 59, add section to support this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Suggest adding action item that addresses planning commission's request of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| commission to review the hillside and ridgetop protection ordinance and update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| This will be done through an ordinance update which will ensure a thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| and detailed look at hillside and ridgetop protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| and incorporate what we have learned over the last 14 years since the plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| The new action item would read 7.6, hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| Consider regulations in the unified development ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3531)|

| 0:58:58| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| According to or by guidance of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| And the language is written as such because when we do review it through an ordinance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| we can't determine at this point if it will, if it will, language will be according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| or guidance, so we included both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| But if we do this through the ordinance process, we can, we can really take a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| look at hillside and ridgetop protection and what we have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3569)|

| 0:59:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Just for Mr. Frazier, it's an advisory document now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3591)|
| 0:59:51| So, are you wanting to make it a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| That's what the ordinance process would determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| This body could determine if we wanted it to be advisory or regulatory and it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| also, you know, we might change the language, place conditions upon hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| I mean, it's really up to the body through the ordinance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| But by adding this language, it's not going to make it a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| It won't make it an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| What this does is on page 59, these are action items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| And so we're just putting it as an action item that we will address Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| recommendation and request of County Commission to review the hillside and ridgetop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| What if this body doesn't create an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| So just so I'm clear, you're wanting to add language that says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| Refer to the future ordinance that doesn't yet exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| What if Commission doesn't create an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| Well, Planning Commission has put forth a formal request of this body to review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| So, no, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| But what if this body decides not to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| I guess you would amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| OK, I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Again, this is an action item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| It's like a to do list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Yeah, it's just if we're voting on something to add something that hasn't yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| We will because I'll bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| Yeah, so we will be just trying to think through all the scenarios of where I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| the first suggestion that is to add something that doesn't yet exist and essentially say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| we're going to abide by the thing that we don't yet have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Well, it does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| We're just going to review it and update it as requested by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| So it does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| We're not creating something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| We're reviewing and revising, updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3713)|
| 1:02:01| Am I ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3721)|
| 1:02:01| Page 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Add section to support this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Suggest adding a new action item as inspired by the Middle Tennessee coalition of nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| It's called the Greater Nashville Regional Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| And this is just the addition of good data to consider when you're looking at land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| It would be an addition of 7.7 where we create a group of GIS layers that depict environmentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| sensitive areas, including this is where we identify environmentally sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| Commissioner J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Areas including prime agricultural soil, historic resources, floodway and floodplains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| hillside and ridgetop protection area, rare and endangered species, protected areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| conservation areas, surface water, wetlands, and other pertinent features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| And use this map layer when evaluating plan amendments, rezoning, and development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| And you can see there I've listed everything that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| And so in working with planning staff, they said that this is an easy ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3776)|
| 1:03:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3785)|
| 1:03:05| All right, Madam Chair, I have one quick question for our law department if you would mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Mr. Moyers, when we go through this, if I remember kind of the process correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| what amendments need to stay in the, within the framework of where we've been and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3803)|
| 1:03:33| been approved to date with some tweaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Like an ordinance would be, I guess, when do we get out of the scope of that, that then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| something has to go back to planning and then come back to us with completely new sections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Because we are under a timeline deadline versus what can be amended later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| I know what you're trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| And unfortunately, the answer is as difficult as the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| The difficulty is that the courts tell us that we have to have the planning commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3843)|
| 1:04:11| recommendations on the things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| We don't have to follow them, but we have to get their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| Now, within the ambit of that, there's a whole lot of leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| And probably the best test is, is this something that the planning commission considered and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| rejected, could have considered, considered tangentially, or is of such sort of minutia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3869)|
| 1:04:39| that if we adopted it and, or if it were sent back to planning commission, it would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| change their outcome, the outcome of the, of what they recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| There is no bright line I can give you on that because the courts haven't given us a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| bright line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3896)|
| 1:04:56| The statutes don't give us a bright line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| When it gets challenged, it gets considered on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| So, to the extent that the planning commission has looked at this entire plan and had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3903)|
| 1:05:13| opportunity to look at these things, I think it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| I think we can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| If we start creating things completely, you know, that hadn't been considered at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| were never brought up, couldn't have been considered by the planning commission, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| you get into those areas that maybe it needs to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| I would say that, that this package of things doesn't have to be, you know, accepted or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| rejected in toto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| And if there are certain things on here that are a close enough question, you could adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| the rest and the plan and send those portions that we're a little bit concerned about back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| to the planning commission and get their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| At that point, you're free to do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| So, you'd have to look at each one and the history of how they got to us to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| And that's something that I couldn't do as I sit here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3969)|
| 1:06:09| That helps explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3974)|

| 1:06:17| Avoid approving isolated developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I'm in language to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| Avoid approving isolated developments where infrastructure and or public services are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| inadequate or not yet planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| I wanted to include this to refer to emergency services, law enforcement, parks and rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| and other government public services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Yes, those are things that we cannot control, but I wanted to show an intent to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| to ensure residents that they have access to these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| How do you define that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| Like, what's isolated a mile away from something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| I'm sorry, Commissioner Ward, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| What's isolated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Define isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4017)|

| 1:07:01| Again, if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Like a mile from another development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| What's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Well, that was language already there, and so I can't define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| I would defer to the leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| The leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| That language has not been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| That is already in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| That's what I'm asking, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| What is that definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Does planning have any definitions for isolated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| For us, it was more about just, I guess, Commissioner Ward, the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| Is it suitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Is the infrastructure there adequate to serve the needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| So, I guess that would be the way I would categorize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| unless someone else has a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| So, is there a list, then, of what is suitable versus what is isolated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4067)|
| 1:07:56| So, it's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| My line of question is that it's just up to interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| and then if it's up to interpretation, it's who the interpretation is it up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| So, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| And those kind of things are always played tricky down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| I'm cool with avoiding, you know, approving isolated developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| if an isolated development is defined as a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| It is a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| The road is less than 22 feet wide, whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| There isn't sewer infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| There isn't, you know, the closest fire department is three miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| Whatever the case may be, how you define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| But I really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| It just opens us up for lawsuits later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| and it opens us up for bad interpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| and it opens us up for playing politics more than, you know, being good stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| So, I would like these kind of things more defined than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| what happens to be the opinion of whoever is around at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| And I might suggest, I mean, we could strike the word isolated here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| and essentially you're just saying approving developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| where infrastructure and or Commissioner Fraser's language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| are inadequate or not yet planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| I mean, I think that resolves that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| And it's really, for us, that's what we were concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| Not so much that they're isolated, but they are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| I get the concern if they're 10, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| 20 miles away from the nearest firehouse, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| And you build a thousand houses, well, the likelihood of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| one out of 10 or one of the thousand are going to go up in flames| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| go up, right, with the more that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| So, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| But I just am asking for a definition of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| Road, infrastructure, sewer, distance from fire departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| things of that kind of nature, I think is just more than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Because your opinion of what is, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| what is going to be different opinions, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| And it's much easier, you know, when you have a ruler versus saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| hey, this is, you know, my hand's 10 inches long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| Well, you think my hand's five inches long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Well, if we get a ruler out, it's actually seven and a half inches long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| So, there's a difference between opinions and the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| And I will say, Commissioner Ward, I've had this very similar conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| asking for metrics and tangibles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| And one thing that the staff has really educated me on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| is a lot of that will be determined in the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| That's where they'll get kind of into the more granular things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| So, I understand where you're coming from, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| because I'm a very black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| I need metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| And so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4239)|
| 1:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Yes, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| This kind of concern about public services where you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| or you mentioned law enforcement and ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| Director Brooks, have we ever taken consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| law enforcement during the planning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| No, not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| How would you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Are you going to tell the Sheriff's Office or this County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| we got to fund another three, four million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| because we're doing a development in Choteau or Seven Islands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| I don't have an answer for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| It's not something that we considered when we developed the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| It'd be something we'd have to, if you all were to amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| we'd have to figure out a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| You know, I agree with the infrastructure of the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| the utilities, and even schools, as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| But when you start talking about the emergency service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| and law enforcement, I don't know how you're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Well, I might just comment that the service would have to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| I mean, that if you, you know, if you're in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| then the service of our Sheriff's deputies would have to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| But to try to get into defining, so does that mean 15 minute call time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| or 45 minute call time is, that would be going down a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| Now, my Seymour Volunteer Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| the citizens come, residents come to them all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| won't try to defeat a project saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| you can't, can you provide the service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| The answer is yes, we will provide the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| If we approve 168 houses, Seymour will provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| The Sheriff will provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| In the case of the Sheriff, we may have to up his budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| to put three more patrols on in that area or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| But that's why I'm kind of concerned about exactly what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| how you're going to define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| So my question is, do we need to even try?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| And that's why I brought it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| We hear quite often from emergency service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| with a concern and a worry about offering adequate services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| because it's not a part of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| during the planning process and the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| And we hear from them saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| you just continue to add units and add units and add units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| and we don't have the equipment, we don't have the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| It's really trying to have a respect also for those service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| and encourage working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| to make sure that we are providing those services adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| But again, it's up for discussion and that's what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4427)|
| 1:13:55| Well, I'd like to make a comment if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| That good article today in the focus about Carnes, 48% subscription rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| If it was 90%, they would have the funds to do whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| Same thing with the rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Rural metro was below 50% on subscriptions rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| Seymour is all volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| The rescue squad is basically all volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| So that being said, it's not really for this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4460)|
| 1:14:30| You know, we'll discuss again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| You know, when you add that in there, I don't, I just not, I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| No, don't be sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| That's what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| I mean, to bring forth ideas and suggestions and discuss them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| and then decide on what we feel is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| So I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4492)|
| 1:14:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| I think it is a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Actually, I think this item is more important than meets the eye because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| I think it comes down to the definition of the word inadequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| and that probably can only be defined as Commissioner Frazier pointed out in the UDO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| right, when we actually have some parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Maybe we do refer to response times for emergency services and law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| given that I don't know if we go down that road or not, but certainly infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| and utilities and public services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| I mean, those, we got to have some very clear parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| First of all, if it's not yet planned, if there's no infrastructure or public services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| planned, there shouldn't be a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| I mean, there shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| But if they're inadequate, that's where, that's where we got to define what inadequate means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| Traffic volume, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Capacity roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| We got to define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| And that's where inadequate is an important word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4562)|
| 1:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| I think I'm having trouble with this particular section because of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| in addition to the comments have been made that public services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| I mean, I really think that would have to be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| And for instance, it says we would refer to emergency services, law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| You know, are we going to go down the rabbit hole of saying you have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| every new house has to have, you know, be within X distance of a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| And then other government services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Does that mean like a trustee's office or a clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| Or I mean, what, what are the other government services, a trash facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| I mean, that we have people that choose to live in all parts of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| not near anyone or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| And if we go down this, that, you know, what is an isolated development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| That could be two homes on one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| A development of how many houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| I just think we, there's a, there's got to be a certain point where either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| we're going to go down this and define it to a scintilla or don't we also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4634)|
| 1:17:22| isn't part of this that we give some guidance to our planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| to our planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| And where does the judgment call and the recommendation from our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| and our commission come into play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Because I think some of this starts to get down into the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| it is so well-defined that it's absolute versus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| I think, I think we're getting good guidance from our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| We're getting good guidance from our planning commission to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| to identify things that are kind of out of the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| I just, I think this is ambiguous and it's really hard to not see us going into a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| sort of a micromanagement of every single level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| So I'm struggling with the sort of ambiguity of the whole statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| And to your point, Commissioner Jay, that was, that was in many conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| about the definition of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| People, there's soft infrastructure, there's hard infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| It's very, it's open-ended as to interpretation of what someone considers infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4696)|
| 1:18:23| Is it a road? Is it a school? Is it a waste management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| Is it, you know, law enforcement, fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| When you read about infrastructure, you can go down that rabbit hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| It's all encompassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| I think, again, this was just putting in because we do have areas of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| where we have heard from citizens and from our emergency service personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| with concerns about not being able to provide adequate services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| And again, this was just to include this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| to show an intent on the county's part to really, to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| I, I, I do, I do hear several of these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| You know, at some point, there's also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| there's also a buyer beware in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| I mean, Mo, it, you need to accept, I would think a reasonable person would need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| that if they choose to buy a house that is, you know, 15 miles from the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| and, you know, hills and dales and all, that there is going to be some sacrifice in this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| So, and in fact, what is offered may, in fact, be adequate given the area, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| So, I, I just, I, I just merely say that, that I'm not sure that burden needs to be totally on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4786)|
| 1:19:56| on planning or even commission to, to dictate some of that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| People make their own decisions about, about where to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| So, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Page 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Anyone moving on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Page 61, 9.8, establish annual coordination meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| Just suggesting changing from annually to bi-annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| to encourage communication with Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| This section is relating just to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| And so, the impact of development on our school system was one of the top three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| priority issues of Advanced Knox that came out of our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| And so, we would further address impact on schools during the UDO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| and the application process of applicants going through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| And we may, you know, go back in a couple of years and change it to annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| but just to kind of get the plan rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| And I don't think any, any of the staff had any reservations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| Did the school system, have you asked them about annually, bi-annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| I just, I wonder if the, if they would have the data on a bi, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| usually they, I'd like to hear from them about, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| Does it, do they need to close out the year to understand where they are with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| student loads and, you know, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| Page 62, 10.1, maintain regular coordination on facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Again, I'd like to see this twice annually, starting out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| And I just suggest adding text to specify a regular coordination of EPW,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| utilities, planning, and schools for long-term fiscal health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| And that's what that is, that section is looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| the long-term fiscal health of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| Page 64, 15.1, maintain cost estimates for common transportation improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Change the language to read, cost estimates shall be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| I think every decision maker will want to know up front the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| transportation projects resulting from development prior to ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| And so this will be determined in the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| Who's responsible for providing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| Providing the cost estimates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| Yeah, how much, how much more burden are we going to put on Jim's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| Does he have to hire somebody just to be going around doing traffic studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| No, they're already planning on doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| This is something that is already planned in the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| He has the capabilities of doing this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| We have a per foot, a road per foot cost assessment for every road that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| So this is something that is, it's not adding additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| I think, you know, Director Snowden can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Yeah, Commissioner Ward, we do keep, every capital project we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| we update our spreadsheets essentially based on cross-section of road and length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| and come up with a per linear foot basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| We also check that against TDOT average unit prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| And then one of the other things we do is part of the off-site ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| that you guys approved, you know, some months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| We do engage the design consultants that do those off-site improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| and they also do the cost estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| And they also do a cost takeoff for that specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| So we do have pretty good robust cost information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| So you're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Okay, as long as you're good, then I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5010)|

| 1:23:40| Just suggest adding language to the second sentence to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| Additionally, ensure that park space is distributed throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| including the expanded growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| This will just help us monitor additional park investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| as we grow in the communities that we've identified in the expanded growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5032)|
| 1:24:00| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| On page 66, add a section to further enhance recreational offerings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5041)|

| 1:24:12| to include provision and maintenance of pocket park slash recreational areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| Again, this is something that would be accomplished through the UDO process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Is that through the parks plan now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| Pocket parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| These would be private parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Private parks, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| I just want to make sure I'm clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Update residential development standards for new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| to include provision and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| So you're requiring that all new residential developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| have a park or a recreation area inside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| Those would be determined during the UDO process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| when they determine the development standards and that's up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| It could be, it could be wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| It could be very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| This is just putting in it in the to-do list for the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| And this is being done in other areas and other communities, counties, and states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| This is something that I think we need to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| So in your vision, who's responsible for maintaining the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| Is it us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| No, it would then go to the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| These are private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| These are private parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| This is, this is within a subdivision development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| It would become a part of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Just like if we were requiring open space or a vegetative buffer, this would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| So they would all have to pay for the playground and the pool and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| and the maintenance of the sidewalks and all the stuff that goes along with the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| So this would be, you're saying that this would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| it reads as if it, it reads here as if it is going to become a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| of every new neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| No, not every neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| This is, this is updating the residential development standards for new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| to include a provision and maintenance of pocket park recreational areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| Now, if you wanted to change the language, new developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| new developments consider the provision and maintenance of pocket park recreations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Yeah, I think I'm, I think I'm more comfortable with the, to consider because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| it, you're requiring people, we all want more affordable housing and if you're going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| home builders to add this amenity and that amenity and that amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| it's going to jack up the price of that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| And while it may be nice and it may be something that many people like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| it may not be something that everybody needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| And I think they, I think I would be more comfortable with the word consider than to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| include because you're really, we're sort of, these are kind of, I feel like some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| these are unfunded mandates that we're sort of saying you as the home builder have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| you have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| And it's like, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| I wouldn't say they're unfunded mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| This is just better planning, better developments for a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Somebody has to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Sure, and it will be the end user typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Yeah, I mean, it's going to raise their price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| And it's very minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Like when I have looked at other areas that are doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| that the impact on the end user is very minimal for the amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| I feel like at some point we do have to let people make their own choice of where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| And some people may say I choose to live in a lower priced house that doesn't have amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5265)|
| 1:27:45| And that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| We shouldn't dictate that everything have, I mean, I don't think our purpose in creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| this is to create a HOA overlay that says you must do all of the things that we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| you to do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| I mean, we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| No, we want to create better policy and better processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| And so if we are asking for a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| I like the word consider more than I like the to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| So I'll just leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| I'm kind of on the same boat with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| I also, I just feel like everybody's pocketbook and wallet is getting killed these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5298)|
| 1:28:25| And to add another, even another 10, 20 bucks a month to some families is just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| And then that just kind of puts them out of that price range for that subdivision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| they might have wanted moved into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| But because they have to have another $30 a month for the park in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| And then it's going to make every house more expensive if every developer has to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| a park as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| I like consideration better than, you know, the wording better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| We changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| I've noted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Is the legislative intent just to allow extra land in a development, Commissioner Fraser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| where if the kids want to go throw a football or a frisbee or they would have an open area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Because so many developments that we approve, every square inch is taken and there's no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| they've got to play in the streets, which is not a not a good option these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5362)|
| 1:29:22| And that is something that we would establish in the UDO and the development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| It could be an open field play area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| It doesn't mean that it has to include very expensive playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| That would all be determined in the UDO and the standards could be as broad or as narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| as we want to define them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| But I think that it's time that we consider asking those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| And Planning Commission and Counting Commission, we can we can suggest those considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| So, I would just like to see more consideration for recreational areas in our in our developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| So, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| I think where appropriate, it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I don't know if it's appropriate everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| I think making it more flexible is best because some areas, they need every inch and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5418)|
| 1:30:26| areas they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| Yeah, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| This would be very beneficial in those areas where we have park deserts to provide recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| areas within subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I just don't know if it's our job to force private businesses to create parks that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| then maintained by the, I don't, I just feel like it's a slippery slope of like we're forcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| things down people's throats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| And then it makes, if you just take away one lot from every single, you're creating, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| have to recoup the money somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| So, then those houses automatically get more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| And then the money to maintain the house has to be more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| So, not only are they financing more upfront, they're also then having a larger HOA bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| And we've just added, you know, not just the HOA, which may not be that much to you, might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| be a lot to some other people, you know, 10, 20 bucks a month might be a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| But you're also financing a couple thousand dollars more every month with high interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| rates already and high inflation and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| I just would like more flexibility than less flexibility when it comes to these kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| So, we can say, hey, yeah, in Hardin Valley, we had a project a couple months back where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| they made like 10 acres into a park for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| But, you know, if it's closer to downtown where they need every inch that we can pack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| in there, like we don't need to take away a quarter acre to like the one that was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| my, down the street from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| They're putting what, 18 units in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| They need all the space, every inch to put that 18 units in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| We have five parks within a mile of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| So, they don't need to put a private park within that HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| I would like to see us have more flexibility, not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| Oh, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Before you go on, Commissioner Frazier, Commissioner Brooks or Mr. Stone, either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5542)|
| 1:32:32| one, we are getting into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5552)|
| 1:32:40| And I would appreciate if you would please just give us some guideline on if these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5560)|
| 1:32:50| adopted and put into this document that in the end, it still will come down to the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5570)|
| 1:32:59| Is that a correct statement or is that not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| Short answer, yes, Chair Lady Hill, that would be my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5583)|
| 1:33:11| These things, we're going to consider these requests and those things would be vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| by the consultant and then recommendations presented to you for either adoption or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5596)|
| 1:33:23| Recommendations through the UDO, you mean, or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| Yes, a lot of these and I wouldn't say all of them are appropriate for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| during that UDO process, but many of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| And yes, we would do some additional research, work with consultants and also there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| have to be some additional public input on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| All right, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| Mr. Snowden, who would enforce when this HOA decides that they don't have a president and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5630)|
| 1:33:58| they don't have a vice president and who's going to enforce them to go out there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| mow that field and do all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| That's part of the process, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Yeah, and I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| I mean, right now it would be, you know, the zoning folks of Knox County, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| They won't even take care of their retention and detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| They let the trees and stuff grow up in them until somebody calls codes and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| hey, you know, our engineering stormwater and they clear them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| The same thing is going to happen here eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| I might add that this is, as I was trying to articulate, it's not, and we absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5673)|
| 1:34:44| have to do this because it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| I mean, the UDO will be the final decision document in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5690)|
| 1:34:59| I understand what you're saying, but like Mr. Fraser says, let's discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| Let's get all the opinions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Yeah, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| I agree with the discussion, but when we try to get to exact specific, what about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| what about that, that's very difficult at this stage to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| We can what if every one of these to death, you know, I mean, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Commissioner Ward, did you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Commissioner Jay, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| Yeah, I just echo, just sort of extending your thought, well, yeah, we could what if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| each one of these, this is a policy document that we are having to put our name on or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| And I think if language matters and if language is going to be proposed to be changed from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| what we've been given, I think it's important for us to go through this minutia because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| at the end of the day, it is a broader policy and we will have to go through the nuts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| bolts on the UDO, but it's still a policy that we have to agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| So, I do think it's important if Commissioner Frazier wants to change the specific language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| here that we kind of up and down or tweak it as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| And I know that, I know it's hard, but at the end of the day, we are putting our name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| on something that we are saying this is the vision for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| So, I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Yeah, I would encourage you all to take these and then put your suggested language or revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| on the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5797)|

| 1:36:45| Yes, I was just going to say to Commissioner Daly's point, Commissioner Frazier had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| that she has looked up some counties who already do this, so we can work with her and get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5810)|

| 1:37:01| a market-driven decision for neighborhoods and it could impact housing costs throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5821)|

| 1:38:41| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| On this one, I would just stop with the word sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| I could add hockey, rugby, any number of other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| I think the goal in here is just to say we are trying to become a regional destination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| for sporting events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| We could do that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Stop at sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| As I said, I tried to include all kinds of perspectives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| Page 70, how to use the plan, change the language in the first sentence to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| The comprehensive plan shall be used on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Again, this is just an area where we could give it a little more teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| So, I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| It's an area where we could give it a little more teeth and that we didn't really see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| huge issue in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| Page 70, development approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| This has already been added and so I apologize for including that once again, but this has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| already been changed in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| So, moving on to page 71, plan management cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| Add a bullet point under annually to support the county's effort to monitor fiscal impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| deviations, or progress of the plan's implementation to read annual fiscal impact report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| This is something that we're already going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| I'm just including it there as a bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| Page 71, plan management cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Again, add a bullet point under 10 years that will support the county's effort to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| all categories of the environmentally sensitive areas like soil, historic resources, protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| and conservation areas in the next updated list of suitability factors used in the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| use model to read, update the suitability factors so that all categories of the environmentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| sensitive areas are considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| These are areas that can change over time and typically a 10 to 15 year period to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| of look at those is a reasonable time frame to revisit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| Those were some of the comments that came from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| Just wanting to include more categories in the suitability factors and so this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6050)|
| 1:40:58| saying the next time that we update it, we will revisit those and include any categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| that have been added or anything that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| Can I just get a definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| There's a lot of soils and all this stuff, just not right now, but down the line, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| we get a definition of what all this soil stuff refers to in the sense of like what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| soil means what and where is the soil and how are we going to test the soil and theory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| with all the soils that are in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| The USGS was responsible for doing a soil survey across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6093)|
| 1:41:40| That's where they mapped actual soil units which have certain categories, characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| The interpretation of those characteristics can change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| So for example, in the state of Tennessee, there are, you know, or actually I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| may be definitions that span the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| There are some that are prime agricultural soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| So the soil units will support a variety of either crop production or other agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6125)|
| 1:42:14| production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Within the state of Tennessee, and I'm not sure at what resolution, whether it's county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| wide or region wide in the state of Tennessee, certain soil units can become locally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| So as certain soil units are consumed by development, other ones will then pop up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| and become more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| And that's a relative definition that will change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| That's kind of what I'm looking at is what is, again, I feel like this is one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| slippery slope things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| If the soil is constantly changing and you're saying different developments, then change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6167)|
| 1:42:54| the category and then we're going off a GIS map that's how old for how much has rain and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| waterfall changed or pushed soils one direction or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| So my question is like, all right, are we now going to go and test every soil on every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6185)|
| 1:43:12| single development here to the end of time and to see whether this soil is on there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| that soil is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| And are we testing it in all four corners and 100 places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| Because when I do construction and we do soil samples for development and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| that, and we have to go down a certain layer, and it's not a cheap process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| It's a $5,000, $10,000 process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| Are we adding $5,000, $10,000 on to every single lot that we develop going forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| get soil samples and to see what the cores are and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| I'm trying to figure out, are we adding a million dollars in construction costs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| every development from here to the end of time by adding so much soil language and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| I think those are good questions, but I do think that the reference is being made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| a static soil map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| So it's not asking people to go out and do soil surveys themselves or soil samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| So it's referring to a static map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| How old is that map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| The map, well, basically, you know how long it takes for soil to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| So soil units don't change very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| There is a certain...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| So it's been here forever, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| It's been there since, I think, they finished in Knox County in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| But they'll update those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| The interpretations will be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| I think the last interpretation was made in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| So there are just some small kind of attribute changes that are made to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| So are we going off of the 2023, these soils in these areas, and where does somebody find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6290)|
| 1:44:59| this map and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Is it on GIS already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Yeah, you could just Google USGS soil map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| There's a web soil survey that anybody can access that you can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| And KGIS, I think it's just been republished with the most recent interpretation on Planning's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6310)|
| 1:45:19| website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| So it is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| So do we know what soil is going to be, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| If you have this soil, you're a unit an acre or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| Oh, that's going to be defined later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| But what's the vision for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| We don't have a vision for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| No, and again, this is just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| So why add it if we don't have a vision for it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Because that's what this plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| It is a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| And this is something that we need to be more intentional about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| Yeah, that's kind of the point of what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| So what is the vision of adding the soil into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| If we don't have an idea of why it's there, why are we putting it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| Well, I think we've heard that we're losing prime farm soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| I mean, once you clear all the trees, you build all the houses, you can't eat money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| So it's important that we start looking at preserving soil in this county and our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6377)|
| 1:46:28| So that's the point I'm getting to is the vision then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| All right, if this soil, this land has this soil, you can no longer develop this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| because it's farmland at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| So we're going to say, hey, here's a thousand acres in East Tennessee, East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| that we can no longer develop because there's this kind of soil on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| That's the point I'm getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| If that's the vision, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| You know, own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| But if that's the vision, then what are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| If we're going to go to this map and this map has 10,000 acres of soil because this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| you know, here's a river, here's a river, here's a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Well, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| The best land is usually near the river, right guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| So if that's the case, well, most of Knoxville is going to probably have this soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| So is that saying that we're going to axe development from tens of thousands of acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| Is that what we're kind of setting up to here long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| It's saying that we're going to consider those environmentally sensitive areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| which we should be doing already and have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| Yeah, I'm just trying to understand what the long term definition is of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| And I'm seeing the setup, so I'm trying to figure out what the punchline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| The punchline is to be more intentional in looking at our environmentally sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| because it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| And as a decision maker, I would like to know what those areas are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6470)|
| 1:47:53| if I'm making a decision for a land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| I would like the opportunity to have that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| to make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| It's on KGIS, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| It's on USGS. You can just Google USGS soil survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| I thought they just said it's on KGIS as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| They just put it on the planning site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| We've had access to that for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| and it's something that we do reference, so it is available on planning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| Thank you. That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| Mr. Snowden, how much does, I know the EPA has warned you out sometimes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6503)|
| 1:48:35| especially some of your roads and projects and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| To what kind of detail do they require us to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6521)|
| 1:48:48| Is it just, well, what do they make us do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| As far as soil characteristics, when any environmental permitting we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| they're fairly silent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| They require obviously that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| they want to make sure that we don't release sediment off site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| But as far as the, like when we do a road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6550)|
| 1:49:15| do they look at these type of things in preservation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| They do not, but it's more of a regulatory of once we start construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| how do we maintain a good, clean worksite would be the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| They typically don't dive down into this granularity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| from a roadway widening or improvement perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Thank you. Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Any other comments on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| Appendix H, place type and zoning correspondence matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| This is page 105 and 106 of the file that's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| I also gave you a hard copy if you wanted to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| And I just, I propose amending and adding language to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| in the introductory section under place type categories and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| adding a sentence that says four possible relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| between place types and zoning districts exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| And then under not related and appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| including just some verbiage there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| the zoning district is not consistent with the future land use map place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| Just kind of giving a definition of what is not related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| The zoning district and future land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| for properties shall be compatible with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Properties shall only be rezoned to a zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| that is directly related to the future land use map place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Properties shall only be rezoned to a zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| that is directly related or partially related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| to the future land use designation for that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| as shown in Appendix H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Zoning districts depicted as not related or appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| are inconsistent with the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| That's just spelling it out a little more and giving it a little more teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| Then moving down under review criteria for all zoning map amendment requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| under Section 3, adding B or conditions could require open spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| provision of amenities, public or private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| landscaping, buffers, or designation of areas not to be disturbed or developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| Again, just giving a bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| And that's all I had for that part of the appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| So, if you were to redo this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6684)|
| 1:51:31| These are not the plan amendment criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| Just the category, place type categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| So, is that what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| This is the place type and zoning correspondence matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6702)|
| 1:51:50| Are you talking about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| So, this is just adding more language to the introductory verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| Page 4, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| It's on the attachment to our agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| It was page 105 and 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6729)|
| 1:52:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6730)|
| 1:52:10| So, I gave you a hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| So, it's just adding some more descriptive language to the text content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| It's page 4 on your, there's the attachment and there's page 4, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| This is referring to this, or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| This is an introductory sheet to Appendix H, which is actually the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| I'm asking you on your handout, it's page 4 and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| which is referring to the separate handout that you gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| and also refers to on the second page, the last page, which is page 9 on your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| So, 4, 5, and 9 for all this trying to follow along where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Yes, correct, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6778)|
| 1:52:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| We have a bathroom break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| It's 6.53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| We'll adjourn until 7.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6800)|
| 1:53:29| I call this meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| Continuing, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Commissioner Fraser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| I just have one more item on the text and language amendment suggestions portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| and then we move on to discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Appendix H, is that what you're getting ready to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Yes, there's just one more consideration on Appendix H under the text and language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| to delete CN and OA from rural living and rural conservation place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| In discussion with staff, we determined that this could have been an oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| CR, commercial rural zoning, has set back in landscaping more aligned to the rural place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| types than CN does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| It also allows many of the same, if not more, uses as CN, and it includes a number of AO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| or office uses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6865)|

| 1:54:36| So, the recommendation is just to delete CN and OA from rural living and rural conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| place types, and the staff seem supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6882)|
| 1:54:48| But I'll defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| Staff, do you have a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| I do not have any additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| We have no issues with the removal of those two districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6899)|
| 1:55:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| And she has moved on, Commissioner Frazier, with a list of discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| Did you have a comment, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| I would like to ask the Mayor's Office, Engineering and Planning, out of all these we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6919)|
| 1:55:27| discussed, if you want to take them one by one or if you've got the ones that you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| have a concern with, I'd like to know if you have a concern or what that concern might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6932)|
| 1:55:41| I think that we could answer as a group because we pretty much work together on all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| Maybe we let Commissioner Frazier finish and we can provide input as she continues to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| if you're interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Yes, we will get back to that, Commissioner Daley, because I have that same question also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| I had a question for the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| This is a policy document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| If we begin to add a bunch of shall versus take into consideration or suggest or however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6975)|
| 1:56:28| you want to phrase it, are we then codifying the stuff that hasn't yet been done down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6994)|
| 1:56:34| Because if it says we shall do X for something that doesn't yet exist, are we saying no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=6994)|
| 1:56:42| what that, if it becomes version A, B, C, D or whatever, we are saying you shall follow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7002)|
| 1:56:52| Are we committing ourselves to something we don't know yet later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| Well, technically you are, but it's not like the thing that you're committing to, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| not going to have to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I mean, to the extent that you're asking about you're committing to something that's in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| UDO that you haven't seen yet, the UDO is going to have to come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| And so if there's something in the UDO that you can't live with, then you fix the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| But every place where you're taking a may or consider and making a shall, you're tying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7040)|
| 1:57:29| people's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| It becomes mandatory at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| And I'll let Commissioner Frazier speak for herself, but I think that's the intent, is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| take some of the wiggle room out of some of these things and make them rules rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| And I totally understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| I guess my comment to Commissioner Frazier would be like, it's hard for me sometimes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7067)|
| 1:57:54| say shall, which is an absolute for something that we haven't yet developed, because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| that thing that we haven't yet developed turns out to be totally left field, I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| never said shall to something that is so off the charts that, you know, it's just very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| hard to say 100% committal to something we haven't even yet as a body discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7091)|
| 1:58:19| But this is, as a policy document, we are committing ourselves to something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| haven't yet figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| And that's where I get stuck on some of the, even if I like the broader idea, it devils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| That is certainly a valid consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Like I said, I would just offer two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| What I said before, whatever you're relying on that hasn't been developed yet, you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| going to have a hand in developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| So it's not like this document is going to come down and you're not going to have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| say, so any you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| But if something like that were to come down, and suddenly your vote for shall, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| couldn't live with any longer and the body couldn't live with any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| This plan is not set in stone either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| This plan could be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| So, you know, I mean, nothing that you do is undoable or unfixable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7145)|
| 1:59:12| Okay, so I wouldn't get too hung up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| Okay, fair point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| Yeah, I mean, I like that answer, Director Moyers, and that clears a lot of things up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| for me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| But Commissioner Jay, I assume you're kind of referring to the red language on page four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7167)|
| 1:59:35| of the handout where it talks about zoning districts and certain zones can't be in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| place type and can't be rezoned this way if they're in this certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| Those are the shalls that seem to be the most prescriptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| I haven't seen any shalls otherwise that alarmed me very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| I guess my point would be to that is, I mean, this document should inform the UDO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7197)|
| 2:00:07| I would hope, or I'm not sure what the purpose of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7207)|
| 2:00:14| If it's only suggesting things, then I would, I don't know why we couldn't just do the UDO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7214)|
| 2:00:23| by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| I would think that there ought to be a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| I don't, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| We don't need to overkill on the shalls, but I think there does need to be some prescriptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| language that informs the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| Otherwise, is it really planning or is it just, we might do this, we might not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7238)|
| 2:00:46| Yeah, I totally hear what you're saying, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| I think to Commissioner Moyer's point, or Director Moyer's point, there's so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7250)|
| 2:00:58| interpretation, even if we end up with a final product, it's still going to be interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| by this legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| That's why I like language that says, for instance, on the first page, page 58, shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7265)|
| 2:01:14| consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| You know, yes, you can consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| But when it gets into shall follow X plan, when X plan hasn't been developed, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| where I get a little nervous because who knows what's going to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| So I understand the teeth, but it's like saying I'm going to buy a car, but I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| engine's in it yet, so do I really want the car yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| And that's the balancing act, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| But I think we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| This certainly is a guidance point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| This is our policy as a unified body to say we're heading in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| So I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| I was in the interpretation that, or in the impression, I should say, that the UDO is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| the teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| I thought this was just kind of the vision guideline of what we're trying to go forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| I don't, you know, shalls get me worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| And I was joking with some of the staff earlier today that shalls get me worried when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| to legal stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| And in here, I don't want to, I want us as a commission to be able to pick what the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7335)|
| 2:02:21| thing or the best thing to do is, you know, for each given situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| I don't really like blocking us into a certain hold, like with the non-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| We want to change a zoning or whatever for a special purpose building or unit that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7353)|
| 2:02:42| think would be really great in this community, but we didn't see it three years ago, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| know, from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7368)|
| 2:02:48| Well, now from this ruling, and now the UDO will describe it as we can't even, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| to, I guess, suspend the rules or cancel the rules or go back to UDO just to go and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| this, you know, we have this great investment that's coming in or potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| I don't want to blow anybody's spot up, but, you know, that they're going to invest millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| of dollars into our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Well, if we need to buy the residential farmland next to it and turn it into industrial, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| well, that's not what it says in the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| But to get these people to spend $300 million here, we might have to eat up two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| lots of residential that are we holding ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| I would hate to be in this seat where like, hey, you can't do that because the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| two generations before you said, you know, made it so that you can't make your judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| now a decade in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| I'm a little bit concerned about restricting the future people that are going to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| our seats after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| I think giving them the intention of what we wanted at this point, at this screenshot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7428)|
| 2:03:55| in time was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Like, hey, these guys wanted to do this, but I don't think anybody for any of their districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| would want to be told from who held our seats 15 years ago that you shall not do that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| I think we would like to be, you know, have a board that we can come together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| hey, 15 years ago that didn't work, but now in 2024 or later in 2030, we can kind of make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7455)|
| 2:04:22| our own decisions and we're not beholden to something that's, it's not for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| It took us, what, 20 something years to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| I don't want to behold, you know, I don't want to hold the commissioners 20 years down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| the road to what we sit here today when all of a sudden there's flying cars and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7474)|

| 2:04:45| And we have a whole different set of problems in front of us, or here's the next pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| where now every time you have a kid, you have 10 kids instead of just one, you know, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| knows what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| So, but I just want to be mindful that we don't restrict the future us is just for present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7494)|

| 2:05:07| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| And my speaking with the staff is, is this going to be revised like it in five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7510)|
| 2:05:19| So, it was supposed to be revised 15 years ago, we never revised it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| So just because it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| But I mean, it can be at any time they can, according to a law director, they can change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| something if they want to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| I do want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| I may get assassinated by friendly fire, if I ask this question, but I've been thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| about it all night, Mr Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| I have an interpretation of the statute question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| I know how I read it, but I'm not a retired chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| So, hasn't the threshold for this process already been met, since it has appeared before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7561)|
| 2:06:10| and been voted on by all three bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| As far as the growth policy plan is concerned, the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| The growth policy plan has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7581)|
| 2:06:21| It has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| This is something entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| We have been operating as long as you've been on this commission as long as I've been around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| here, we've been operating on a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| That's what the zoning code requires us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| When we adopt zoning, the planning commission is required to come up with a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| And what we've done for the last many, many years, we've had a general plan and we amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| it piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| We'll come up with sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| We'll amend those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| This is a, correct me if I'm wrong, Director Brooks, this is a wholesale reimagining of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| the general plan of a type that hasn't been done as long as I've been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| That's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| And so because it's happening in coordination with the growth plan, I can understand how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| you might get these matters conflated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| It would be easy to have that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| The growth plan is the dead hand of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| It's controlled this commission for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| And that's the thing that you don't have direct control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| We have to have the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| We have to have buy-in from the city and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| This is entirely your baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| And so anything you do, as I said a few minutes ago, you can undo or you can change as circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| And it's not merely the production that changing the growth plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7654)|
| 2:07:42| So while this is big and it's complex, it really isn't fundamentally different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7662)|
| 2:07:52| what you do practically every month when you amend the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| We're just doing it on a larger scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| So that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| And then the UDO is just the zoning code that's built on top of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7679)|
| 2:08:06| So we've got the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| We're done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| The comprehensive plan, which is what this is, we're amending everything we've done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7694)|
| 2:08:14| And the UDO is a reimagining of our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| These are really three distinct processes that are being slapped into one very short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| time span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Although the UDO, and probably not another year or two on the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| 18 months to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| 18 months to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7718)|
| 2:08:38| So this process, though, while they're tied together, they are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7718)|
| 2:08:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7725)|
| 2:08:45| But despite the fact that they're tied together, the timeline threshold for the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| plan has already been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| It has been, except you'll recall that this commission voted to approve the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| contingent upon the adoption of this comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7742)|
| 2:09:02| So if we don't get this comprehensive plan done in a timely fashion, and our deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| is May 27th, then we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| Because unless we change the way we approved the growth plan and uncouple this from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7751)|
| 2:09:20| we'll run out of time on May 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7764)|
| 2:09:24| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| And I'm wondering if that doesn't address some of your concerns, Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| that things may not be the same in five years or 10 years, that we do have the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| make change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| It isn't like when we do this, we are nailed to it for infinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7780)|
| 2:09:48| My thing is the UDO is supposed to be the teeth part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| This is supposed to be the guidance part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| So now you're making double the work going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| That was more of my opinion on this whole thing is this should be guidance, not law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| And then the UDO part, which would be more the teeth, more like the law part of it, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| actual zoning part, was the impression that I was undergoing through this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| This is just the middle layer and the three layer cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| So I thought this part would be more broad and then we would get to the finite details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7817)|
| 2:10:25| in the UDO part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| So my concern is making this detailed and restrictive is then putting restrictions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7827)|
| 2:10:34| what can happen in the UDO and then going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| And then you would have a two-step process to undo everything, which is going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| a couple months just to get one thing through because you'd have to have an ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| and then you have to do another change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| So now we're going for a four to five-month process if they want to change anything going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| So that was kind of my concern is I would rather see this be broad and intentional in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7856)|
| 2:11:04| the sense that, hey, this is what we want to see as our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| And then the UDO has all the teeth in the world, as much teeth as you want, go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| I'm not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| So it's two years away from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| But you can make it and define it whichever way you want to do it at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7873)|
| 2:11:19| And then you can change that every single month if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| It's not the general vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7881)|
| 2:11:27| And to that, you can consider Appendix H kind of as the transition plan for the SHOWS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7887)|
| 2:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7900)|
| 2:11:40| Moving on to discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| Ma'am, one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| No, I clicked it late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| That's kind of more of the point that I was making that Commissioner Fraser just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| the H, this last part, is what's going to guide us for the next two years in the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7911)|
| 2:11:59| So that's where I'm saying the SHOWS and what you can and can't do going forward is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| going to be restricted by this one little piece for the next two years as we define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| So how much restriction do we want to put in this over the next two years while we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| defining it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| So that was kind of like, hey, are we pigeonholing ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| I look at this from a personal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| So I'm gone in four months, as everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| So the next two years, you guys are going to be holding to this until the UDO is defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| So you have all these SHOWS and the restrictions and the non-related stuff, all that's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| So the next two years, you guys are boxed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| And if you make it restrictive at this level, instead of you guys deciding what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| to do, to a degree, I'm not saying that's completely restrictive, but to a degree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| the way that I'm reading it, the way that I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| And I might be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| Director Moyers, you can correct me if I am, but that's kind of the way I'm perceiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| Yeah, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| I think using the language that it boxes us in and it restricts us is very restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7978)|
| 2:13:08| Will you say that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| I feel like your description of this is boxing us in, this is tying our hands, this has very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7991)|
| 2:13:19| little restrictions in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| Very, very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| My point is the non-restrictive part, non-related part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| So I could have added a whole lot more shalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| I'm sure you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8012)|
| 2:13:32| I'm sure you could have read a dictionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| But my point is what we have in front of us is the one non-related part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8014)|
| 2:13:41| And that's where the shalls are in here and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| I'm just saying, knowing that we might have a $300 million development coming down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| road, are we going to hold ourselves for the next two years and not be able to do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| But this body should be able...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| I don't, I guess my point is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| You have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| We have those processes in place where both the Planning Commission and County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| would consider changing or amending zoning, sector plans, you have that option now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8042)|
| 2:14:09| And if you justify and you support your case for a change, those bodies can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8049)|
| 2:14:17| This is not keeping us from a tremendous opportunity that's coming to our area and saying to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8057)|
| 2:14:24| we're going to limit what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| That does not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| This does not do that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| I'm asking what's the point then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| The point is because we've done a really crappy job with planning and land use over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8073)|
| 2:14:39| 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| And we are going forward and not backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| Because where we are now is not fiscally sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| I'm saying, what's the purpose of this one paragraph that you're putting in if you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| do it already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| Because I trust the members of this board to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| This is what I'm not understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| Why put this in here when you just answered my question, which is we don't need to adhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8099)|
| 2:15:05| to this anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Because we have a history of being too loose and too interpretive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| But that's your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| It's your opinion as well that we haven't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8115)|
| 2:15:15| But we're a member of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| So I would like to see the 11 make the decision, not me or you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| That's why we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| That's my point is I trust my 10 other colleagues for you guys to vote when I'm not here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| make the decision for me and my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| I don't want it to be Commissioner Frazier's opinion or Commissioner Ward's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| It should be the body of 11's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| So I don't want to put that restriction on you, even though, yes, you can dance around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| it if you want to dance around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| That's my point that I'm trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| What's the point of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| The point of it is, in your opinion, it's too loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| And in my opinion, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Hopefully, we'll find balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| Well, the balance is the 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| And I would rather it be to the 11 than you or me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Well, representing all districts, I can take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| the residents of every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| And I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| So moving on to discussion items, page 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8174)|
| 2:16:14| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| I might just suggest, Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8176)|
| 2:16:22| I don't see many absolutes that aren't followed by will consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8182)|
| 2:16:32| I might just ask that perhaps when we come back next week, if you could select those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| ones that you feel like are absolutely are shalls that are too restrictive as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| to shall consider, because shall consider is pretty loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8211)|
| 2:16:51| You know, so that's just a suggestion instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| throwing the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| Just do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| For me, it's all the shalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Just do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| I'll bring it to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| A shall consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| It is a guidance form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| It's not a restrictive, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| I think the UDO is the teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| I think this is guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| So I think everything should be shall consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| I don't think anything should be shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| But that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| Would you bring those back then next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| That's just a recommendation, a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| I can't make anybody do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8251)|
| 2:17:31| Discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8251)|

| 2:17:43| We have policies 3.1, 4.1, 4.3, 6.2, 6.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| All of Section 7 and 9, those all kind of relate to mitigating the fiscal and physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8269)|
| 2:17:55| impact of urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| And I just wanted Director Brooks to kind of speak to those just a little bit and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| Because that's an important issue that has been brought to our attention throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8290)|
| 2:18:10| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| Might not be getting exactly what you are asking me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| But I will say, I know you had brought up in previous conversations that you were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| that eliminating urban sprawl wasn't explicitly identified as part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| And what I articulated as the goals of the plan, one of the primary goals of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8308)|
| 2:18:35| was to chart a different course for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| One that is aimed at more responsible growth, that's more fiscally conservative, and focuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8318)|
| 2:18:44| future growth where we have infrastructure to support that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| And I would say all of the policies that you just listed out are aimed specifically at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8327)|
| 2:18:56| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8336)|
| 2:18:56| So how do we do a better job at guiding where growth should go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| And really considering curbing that urban sprawl going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| That answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| Did anyone have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| Page 57, 5.4 provides site design flexibility for amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| I just had a question for Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| The second sentence references the use of a point system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| And I was just curious, is there a point system that we are considering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| And will it be included in the UDO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| There isn't a specific point system, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| It is something that the consultant identified that we felt like was reasonable to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| further and will do so as part of the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| And then ultimately bring what our suggestion would be back forth to this body for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8384)|
| 2:19:52| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Page 59, encourage development practices that can serve and connect natural features and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8396)|

| 2:20:01| This is just a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| I'm just wondering, is this an appropriate section to include a new action item that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| was suggested by the Sierra Club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| And I included how that would read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| And it would be 7.7, create design standards that encourage connection of natural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| to provide an ecological framework and promote migration for wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| Development plan review and approval should look for opportunities to connect open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| and natural habitats across developments and consider threatened and endangered wildlife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| species and wildlife corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| And if this isn't the appropriate section, is there an appropriate place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8435)|
| 2:20:45| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| I think this could be added here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| Again, this really does speak to creating those design standards as something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| would do as part of that Unified Development Ordinance, part of the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| But yes, I don't see any particular issue if that was the desire of the commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| add an additional action item here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| On page 59, I was just going to ask Director Snowden and Director Brooks, would considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| design elements for the rural place types protect and enhance existing rural heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| character?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| Would it be appropriate to add that to this section or will this be something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| addressed in the UDO and how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8493)|
| 2:21:42| I'll speak to the roadway and let Amy kind of speak to the planning place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| I mean, I do think that as part of the Unified Development Ordinance, we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| create typical cross sections for roadways that would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| I mean, obviously, right now, our typical subdivision street is a 26-foot wide curb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| street that's probably somewhat out of place in a rural setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| You know, maybe a 20-foot wide street with some ditches and, you know, that serves the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8525)|
| 2:22:10| community, looks more appropriate, as well as probably save some money for the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| So, from the roadway infrastructure, I think I could support a design standard for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8536)|
| 2:22:25| rural area specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| Well, that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8553)|
| 2:22:34| Commissioner Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| Oh, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| Director Brooks, I saw your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| You know, I'll just add to this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| So, this one does give me a little bit more pause in terms of, you know, what you actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| mean about design elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| I think that this is something that definitely would need to have some additional consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8572)|
| 2:22:56| or, you know, what type of design elements or what does it mean by heritage character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8576)|
| 2:23:04| defining elements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| We're talking about what kind of fence somebody can put up, what kind of materials they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| use on their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| So, I just think that those are things that would need to be further vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| That's why it was just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| Page 63, 13.1, collaboratively identify barriers to students being able to walk or bike to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8601)|
| 2:23:27| school in specific areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| This was a question for Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| Can we require the installation of sidewalks in the PRZ zone prior to construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| The reason I ask is we had a situation in Hardin Valley where it was in the PRZ zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8618)|
| 2:23:44| They were required to put in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| They built out completely the development and then decided to work on the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| and the utilities underground would not prevent those sidewalks to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| And so, we heard from a lot of angry folks who purchased homes within a PRZ zone planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8639)|
| 2:24:07| to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| This also exacerbated congestion, vehicular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| So, I'm just asking the question, is there an appropriate place in this or is that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8654)|
| 2:24:20| the UDO as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| I know our sidewalk ordinance, it could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| Yeah, and I think what this body did a few months ago with the offsite development ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| has corrected this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| I'm familiar with the situation you're referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| If that development had been approved and the ordinance that this body adopted would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| have been in place, we would have ensured the completion of that prior to any release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| of building permit or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| We can revisit it in the UDO and maybe clarify it a little better, but the processes we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| in place today would prevent this from occurring again in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| I think you talked about we now have a process in place where we would identify if those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| utilities underground would prevent a sidewalk not coming in afterwards and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8703)|
| 2:25:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8710)|
| 2:25:10| My department obviously deals a lot with utility coordinations, probably more so than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| development communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| We're just more versed to have those conversations and now this ordinance allows us to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| on behalf of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| Thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| Yeah, that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| Yeah, page 67, 19.3, just where it talks about Knox County School could provide land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8725)|
| 2:25:31| open to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| This is just something I was hoping that you could explain to me how is this being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8733)|
| 2:25:37| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8737)|
| 2:25:37| I know we have kind of, do we have an MOU or how are those properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8737)|
| 2:25:46| I spoke with Joe Mack earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| We have, we no longer have MOUs in place with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| We do use Knox County Schools for basketball, so we have a working relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| And then also some of the high schools use our county parks currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240415?start=8757)|
