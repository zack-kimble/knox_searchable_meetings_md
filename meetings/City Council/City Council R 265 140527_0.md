| 0:02:29| I said nine weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| Or maybe Mark can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| It was passed in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| On the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| On the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| It will not, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| It has to be acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=169)|
| 0:03:02| If you could do it for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Okay, I'll change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| I'd like to postpone it for four weeks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Is your light on for that, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| So there's a motion and a second to postpone 9-0 for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Okay, items to be added by Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| You're still on postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| I received emails this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| I thought Councilman Greene would move, but there were folks from West Knoxville asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| us to postpone 9-L, M, and N, which are the apartment complex out on Thunderhead Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=217)|
| 0:03:48| I don't know if there's someone here to speak to that or not, but I just would bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| They were asked to postpone it so they could discuss the density of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Are you making a motion to postpone, or are you asking Councilman Greene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| Postpone for four weeks, but I don't know if there's someone here to represent what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Let me call on Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Councilman Greene, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| What I was going to say is I think all of us received that email about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| I talked to Mr. Slagle on Friday about the postponement and said that I would not postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| So that was on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| We did get a bevy of emails today from those people in the adjoining county neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| who asked for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| My feeling is that we've discussed this and we've worked with it for over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| and that we need to go ahead and act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Councilman Del Vecchio, did you want to hear from Mr. Slagle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| If he would just give us a minute's worth of what they're going to do in this postponement of, say, four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| I would be interested in knowing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| We've just gotten some new information about a former development that they had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| and we'd like more time to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| But if we can't, we're prepared to go forward or not, but we'd like to postpone it if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| Would two weeks or four weeks be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Either one would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| You could do it in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| I'll make the motion that we postpone those three items that are related for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| I don't know if there's a second or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| There's no second, so that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Okay, so anything else for postponement added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Now, consent items, there's 11C, a certificate of compliance, 11D, a pension, and 12C, 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| For the mayor's report, first, I hope you all had a great holiday weekend, Memorial Weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Of course, we get off from work and have time to play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| but we're also really there to honor, recognize those who lost their lives in service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| And many of us were at Fountain City, Honor Fountain City Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| and I had the privilege of being the keynote speaker there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| but many of us were there to talk to the folks in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| and talk about their 39 or so years of coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| as part of Fountain City Town Hall and their Honor Fountain City Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| And I want to say thanks to Daniel Dunn, who is the chair of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| and who invited me and all of us, I think, to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| It was really a great occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=385)|

| 0:08:13| and this is a great new use of that beautiful park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| and it will further enhance its place as a real center of community life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| So we encourage people to come out for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| and on Fridays to go there for a farmer's market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| and on Saturdays to come down to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| So that is the end of my reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| Council, do you have reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Okay, then we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=516)|

| 0:09:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=541)|

| 0:09:17| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| 9A is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| for the several departments, agencies, and funds of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2014 and ending June 30, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Councilman, or Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Do you want to speak to this first or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Probably, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| I mean, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Well, I know we've had a little bit of time to look at that since last Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| But let me also add we do have one person who's here to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Wednesday or Thursday when we had our budget hearing for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| I have heard from a number of people, I'm sure others have as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| that are concerned about especially senior citizens and folks on fixed incomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| who are going to be facing this tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| and what might seem small to one person is significant to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| I recall one gentleman telling me about him charging some of his extra costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| for heating and everything else this winter on credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| He's already behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| He's just trying to keep afloat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| In looking at the budget documents and the hearing information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| I am proposing a motion to amend the budget to reduce the total tax burden by $6.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=643)|
| 0:10:54| I have given to members of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| I guess you weren't here when I passed these out earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Let me pass one over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| But I don't see Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Is Jim here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Maybe someone could give one of these to Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| But what you'll see is there's a three-page handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| The third page is, as I understand our obligation under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| the various codes and accounts that we are allowed to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| as the council reviewing them under Section 901 of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| You will see under revenues, obviously we don't have much control over collecting those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| but the figure $6.226 million is shown as reducing the property tax portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=694)|
| 0:11:43| And that would lower the operating budget from $200.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| as you proposed it, to $194.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Below that in the appropriations section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| you will see several items in the middle column that are adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| One of them, it's public works 41100 is the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| And it's the $179,170 for the vacant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| Christy has now moved up to deputy mayor and COO, and that's a vacant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| It may not need to be filled, and certainly we don't need to tax for it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| If something comes up later, we can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| But it seems to me that that one comes out fairly easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Further down, agency grants, they had increased from about $712,000 last year to $1.255 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| And again, I don't believe that we have line item interior to agency grants to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| but perhaps we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| But from what I've heard so far, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| And I'm suggesting that we reduce that total by $500,000 to $755,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| That's more than last year by about $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| And if you look at the first two pages that I handed out are cost-saving measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| And things we could look at stretching over more than one year instead of doing it all in one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| are some of the capital grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| We have a quarter of a million to Boys and Girls Club, 45,000 to Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| $250,000 to the Botanical Garden, $4,500 to the Civil War Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| Connect Ministries capital grant, $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| And I don't know if those are the ones that should be cut or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| And frankly, under the charter, I don't think we get to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| But it seems to me there's enough float in that group that if we reduced it by $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| you and your staff could find the best way to distribute the remaining funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| and it would take some of the tax burden off the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Looking further down to that account number 98100 reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| that's really just a mathematical exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| If we lower the amount of the revenues and tax related to that to the $194 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| 1% would come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| And that figure is shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| And then in the final item, I don't know why it's grayed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| I guess it's the Xeroxing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| There's something called transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| And, of course, our budget has a number of transfers from one account to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| in many cases from debt service and other parts of the tax levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| But I have $5.547 million shown there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| And that translates into a number of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| If you look further down under the fund section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| you will see that capital projects has $5.207 million reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| out of the $27 million that you proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| A lot of great projects, a lot of great agency grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| but I am still concerned that we shouldn't tax any more than we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| We have people that need to carefully govern their dollars on fixed incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| Councilman Pavlis said he's on a fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| That may be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| But it's probably higher than some of the folks living on Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| And I think we need to be mindful of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| And I think we also need to be mindful of not becoming a city that raises its taxes too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| That pretty much covers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| There's two other items shown there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| One is the $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| And Councilman Pavlis had volunteered during your budget hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| to cut the $90,000 community improvement grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| As our part of trying to cut six or more percent, that might be ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| But that's what that $90,000 is that if we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| or at least if I'm going to suggest that others have to cut projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| then we should be willing to sacrifice as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| There's a $250,000 cut under miscellaneous special revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| That's a fund number 240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And that is one-half of the, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| one-half of the amount proposed for historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| I don't see any reason why we couldn't do that half this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| and half next year instead of all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| and, again, lower the burden on the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| The capital projects, you will see there's a number of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| on the first two pages of the handout that discuss things that strike me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| as one, not urgent, two, not primary service obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| that we have to our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| and three, things that could be spread over more than one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| and so then, again, in essence, lower the tax burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| Anyway, the third document that we're just talking from is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| as I understand it, the basic structure of the ordinance we have before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| under 9A with the new figures shown and the amounts of the adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| And, obviously, this would greatly benefit from a sit-down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| with finance and your chiefs of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| or that's something you can do alone or we'd be thrilled to do it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| But if the council is willing to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| we obviously don't want to cut something that needs to be done now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| but we should be willing to defer over several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| or eliminate some charges that we can live without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| I don't think we should tax taxpayers to give away money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| which are some of those grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| And they're all worthy causes and they all do good things for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| But, again, I'm sure every individual out there knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| what they would like to support, whether it's Wounded Warriors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| or something else, and they ought to be able to make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| and us not make it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| I'm saying that we amend the budget to $194,213,940| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| as the new item with the revenue adjustment coming out of local taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| That motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Well, I want to speak to it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| You know, I appreciate the hard work that's gone into it, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| I appreciate your amendment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| When we talked a little bit about this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| and I've explained it to you, Mayor, so it's no surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| My concern is that we're tacking on to the $34 million bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| that we agreed to, and the final approval of that, I think, was in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| And we go back in time, which was approved in your last year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| but we've approved for that to be done, but it hasn't been done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| And a lot's changed since we started talking about this a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| the $10 million surplus that we came about just a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| We were aware of that, and now this tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| And my quick math, so I'll be the first to say I'm not good at math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| but my quick math is I think we ought to postpone this vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| to give us some time to study the math, and with a $0.34 tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| is there a way to, well, I might agree to the tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| but is there a way to defer some of the projects that have been asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| in order to see if we can repeal the bond issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| I'm not adverse to debt on real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I'm adverse to projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| I did vote for that bond issue when it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| and it was much the same reason that we got to this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| that you're asking for this vote tonight on this tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| because we were trying to spur public projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| that might encourage private investment, and what we've seen at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| And that is part of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| So now with the tax increase, I would think time would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| can we delay some of the pledges that you've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| and repeal the bond issue, the $34 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| It's a loan. Let's call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Because that's, as Jim York explained during our budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| that's $2 million a year that we've got to account for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| And I believe that the way things are going in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| and I believe in the momentum that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| and the buzz, as you say, we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| I think there's going to be some worthwhile projects coming our way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| in the future that we're going to wish we had not spent $34 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| on some projects that we can either get out of cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| or get out of this budget increase and save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| So we're not in a time crunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| There's no real urgency to pass it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| I would just like to study it for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| postpone it for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| and see if a $0.34 tax increase would help us keep from issuing the $30 million debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| So I'll put that out there as a motion to postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| I'll second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| We have until June 10th, I think, the next meeting to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| The 15th is the drop-dead date under the charter, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| There's a motion and a second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| I would like to just respond to part of what you said, Councilman Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| and I respect we've had some conversations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| I would suggest that with the bond issuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| we have postponed this and we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| Where's Jim York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| He's going to be very cautious about when we go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| We have the authority to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| And it's really, as you know, for major projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| for the public works complex, for zoo projects, for the Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| And what did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| And so these are when you have major projects like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| it's harder to cash flow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| It's just like when you buy your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| We can cash flow a lot of your stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| but it's harder on the big-ticket items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| And that's why a year ago we made the case to have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| to issue debt on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| We're not going to issue that until we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And as I also mentioned to you, at the end of this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| if we see we have, say, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| the Hall income tax comes in higher than we had predicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| as it did last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| then we are more than willing to look and see whether, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| we can cut back on some of that debt that we do issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| if those kind of excess dollars come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Because we, like you, do not want to issue any more debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| than we feel is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So, you know, we ask Council not to delay this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| but to go ahead on what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| knowing that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| if we can cut back on that before we have to issue debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| then that's something we're very willing and anxious to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| Well, I mean, are you convinced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| I mean, you have the, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| so you have the access to Jim York to study that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| I just think if we had a little more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| could we, we've pledged, you have pledged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| to support some very worthwhile projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| And as I said at the budget hearing, your absence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I think it's appropriate that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| the mayor should have that discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| I mean, as Nick pointed out in the first paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I mean, in an ideal world, I mean, we would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| this is what we're willing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| and, you know, the mayor should have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I mean, I fully believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| and certainly not trying to take that away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| But I guess what I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| I mean, I can agree to the 34-cent tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| but that bond issue, it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| It's $2 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| You know, I think it's a 20-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| We haven't done it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| And things have changed since we started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Things have improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I mean, your pension, your pension did well this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| and, you know, you don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| The hall tax, we're selling houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| and people are paying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| they're coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Apartments are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| I think you're going to see our economy grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| I think there's a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| and I guess I'd like to see the pro forma from Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| of what that would have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Could we, you know, agree to postpone the pledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| of those developments or, you know, those pledges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| in order to, you know, see the 34-cent tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| would keep us from that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I think there's a better time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| There's better pride now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| given what we know in the last 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| and I think there's better things on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| You know, again, the problem with the two-week delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| is we're not going to really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| our end-of-year numbers until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| We won't know hall income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| until the end of July, 1st of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| And so, really, even a delay of two weeks is not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| We wouldn't be able to put those numbers together for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| But I can pledge to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| that we will take a good look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| share with you those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| and if it's feasible to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| You know, of course, anything we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| has to come back to council to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| And so, if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| there were excess hall income tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| we would come to council with a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| and you all ultimately would decide on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Vice Mayor Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| We have an audience person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Didn't someone sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Yeah, right, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Mr. Travis Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| I'm Travis Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| I'm the president of the Fountain City Line Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And I just wanted to come before the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| and, first of all, to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| for your continued support of the Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| But as many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| while we maintain both the park and the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| we don't own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| It is actually deeded to the citizens of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Therefore, it's deeded to the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| And so, it's this continued partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| that we've had with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| with Joe Walsh and Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| with the mayor, with the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| that we can do big projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Our focus is more than just eyeglasses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| which is what many people think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| or the gumball machines that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| that have a little lion symbol on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Our goal is for the betterment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| of our fellow man, of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| and of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| And so, it's through this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| that funds are being given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| to help us improve the lake and its situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| You know, 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| it was a little different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| You could throw a couple hundred pounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| of aluminum sulfate in the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| We're not concerned with that as anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| And so, I encourage the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| to approve the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| but we also mainly just want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| for supporting us and supporting others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| And these funds will help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| serve others in more ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| such as the eyeglasses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| such as leader dogs for the blind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| juvenile diabetes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| all things that we gather together to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| And so, we just wanted to come officially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| before you all and say thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1609)|

| 0:30:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1803)|

| 0:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| And so these are just some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| reasons why we're dealing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| proposed increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| And I wanna say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| if we look back just one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| on the previous budget, what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| we funded Setre Landing park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| which'll be a 5 acre park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| contained in a South Waterfront plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Fort Dickerson entrance to further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| enhance the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| we had public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| to downtown, which compliments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| past investment by the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| sector of the State Street Garage expansion, the Entrepreneur Center, completed its first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| year. Engineering oversaw $9.4 million worth of projects. And we've done this with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| of the highest bond ratings in the past 25 years for the city, one of the highest rainy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| day reserves, and with less employees than we had 10 years ago. And I think that's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| a lot of the emails I got, oh, you need to cut all the fat out of the personnel and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| have you. We've done all this. Everything that you all, that this city has seen us progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| and move forward in the last 12, 15 years, we've been able to do it with less employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| So, you know, there's not a whole lot of fat in there to cut out. And I think the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| and Jim, your work and team have, you know, exhibited that to us over these last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| of weeks. And so some of the highlights of the proposed budget, I want to touch on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| of the highlights and then, you know, I'm going to turn it over to some of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| If we pass the budget as proposed, we'll provide repair to the fire and police facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| as well as provide for training facilities and new equipment to better protect and serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| our constituents. We'll address chronic and blighted properties in our neighborhood, support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| historic preservation, implement strategies for homelessness. We all approved the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| plan on homelessness. More greenways, enhancements to our parks, more sidewalks and road paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| We'll continue to support the investment we've made in downtown by adding more infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| downtown. We owe it to the taxpayers, the people who have paid taxes to this city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| we've been able to invest in and make this a vibrant, buzzing town. We can't not continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| to invest in our city. So, and I talked, you know, Rhonda Rice, the Executive Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| President, I think she is, of the Chamber, she came and spoke to us at our first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| of the month. And I followed up with her recently and I asked her, I said, what do you do when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| you have a prospective company that comes to Knoxville, I want to know exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| it is that you tout Knoxville as being. And this is a list of the things that she says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| that they always do. It says, Knoxville is a home to a thriving downtown with the arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| theaters, outdoor concerts and entertainment of all types. Variety of both local and national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| retail with great attraction to diverse populations, including the University of Tennessee. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| urban wilderness, outdoor recreational opportunities, extremely attractive to young professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Growth out major arteries from downtown, Happy Holler, Sutherland, South Waterfront, Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| Corridor. A community that embraces sustainability, public transit, greenways, renewable energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| and farmer's markets. Strong business environment, ease of working with codes and fire inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| of both large and small businesses. These are the very things that are contained within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| this budget that's being proposed. We talk about economic development and investing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| our community. This is what the people that we pay, our Chamber, this is what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| and this budget supports all that. So, in closing, you know, we all attend, we've all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2037)|
| 0:34:07| been on this council some longer than others, but we all got our feet wet now. We all go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| very vigorously to neighborhood groups throughout the city and the very things that we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| about, you all know this is what we hear about. Sidewalks, greenways, paving, fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| blighted properties and these are the things that we're answering our constituents. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| is what they want and I assure you, if we were to cut this budget or not do it, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| effects will be greater in the years to come because it will be a constant barrage of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| that we didn't do what we told them that we would do and they're not getting their bang| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| for the buck. I'm going to support it as presented and I hope my fellow council members will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| as well. Thank you, Councilman Marshall, Councilman Starr. Thank you, Mayor. You know, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| Vice Mayor Pavlos makes some great points, you know, and I certainly, you know, agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| with the vision and path the city's on, but I think, you know, the real point and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| I've said it three times now and the biggest problem I have with the budget is the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| You know, there is some projects in this budget, but more than half of the increase is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| directly to the pension and I just don't feel like we've adequately addressed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| problem. I feel like this budget, we're paying for the water damage, but we haven't fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| the broken pipe. Today we could pass this budget. Tonight we can pass this budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| the city hires somebody tomorrow. That person works for the city for ten years. Then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| city is then legally obligated to pay them and their beneficiaries for decades. To me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2155)|
| 0:36:04| as a policy, that just doesn't make sense. I think there's been some recent reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| that really highlights this problem and I certainly acknowledge that the step we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| two years ago was a huge step forward and was dramatically different than what's before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| but in terms of why we're here, that's 100 percent why. If you look at the budget ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| years ago, it was $144 million with the general fund. Without a tax increase, this year it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| would be $186. So that's an average compounded growth rate of 2.7 percent. So as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| our costs are growing at 2.7 percent or below, we would be okay. If you look at the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| ten years ago, it was $1.6 million. This year it's $23.4. That's an annual compounded growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| rate of 28 percent. It's just completely unsustainable. You know, I love this city like we all do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2215)|
| 0:37:04| and to have the funds available to invest in a lot of things we want to invest in, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| have to balance that. So that's the problem I have and that's just why I'm unable to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2231)|
| 0:37:20| it until we stop, you know, have done all we can on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2240)|
| 0:37:30| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you, Mayor. As my colleagues know, you know, I didn't support the Mayor's plan as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| far as the pension. I also didn't support the 2.5 percent pay increase. But I don't think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| what we're dealing with. In other words, that's there regardless of whether we make a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| in the pension or not. We have to take care of that situation in all due respect to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| colleague. And the same thing with the 2.5 percent. The thing is, as I mentioned the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| day at our retreat, is that our city is on a really growth pattern in terms of where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| headed. As the Mayor often refers to it as the buzz that goes around. And we go to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| neighborhoods and sure, we're getting emails and we're getting calls about the fact of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| a tax increase. But you know, if we don't invest, we're not going to move forward. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| what this budget does, it invests in things that I personally am interested in to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| a great city. And that's the greenways, the parks, the places where people go and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| It's also one of the first budgets that we've seen where we're really going to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| arts. And the arts add to what we already have in this cultural city that we have, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| And so I think that we need to realize that the pension, we shouldn't hold this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| hostage because of what the pension is. I do agree with Councilman Stier that it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| that we have to work on. I think that this Council is committed to continue to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| that. I think that with what we see the Pension Board is doing. I also think the Mayor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| committed to continue to work on the pension. But let's not hold this budget up because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| of something that we have no control over, which is the pension and also the automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| 2.5% pay increase, which I also hope that we'll look into and work on that. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| it's a budget that has a lot of diversity. It spreads the money throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| It's not just in one area. And I think it's a good budget and it's one that I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| to support, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you. I've had emails and phone calls on both sides of the tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| Some people opposing it and some people supporting it. I think I almost fell over sometimes when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| I got those calls. But anyway, they were there. Yesterday the Mayor in Fountain City said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| that we really have three constituencies in the city of Knoxville. We have seniors, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| have the Baby Boomers, and some of them are at the lower edge of being senior, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| have the Millennials. And not all three groups have the same goals. The Millennials want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| many of the things that are in this budget that somebody I know who's 75 would never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| think important at all. I also have a good friend who is 71 and will never be on a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| and will never ride a bike. But he called me today and said, we need to do this. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| I thought that was a good thing. The other point that I made Wednesday at the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| hearing was there is never a good time. We can postpone something this year and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| well, we'll take care of it next year. Well, next year comes and there's a reason to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| it again. And we can postpone and postpone and postpone and things don't happen. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| then we start to slide backward. If we don't maintain the momentum that this city has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| and we start to slide backward, it will be very, very expensive to pull out of that hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| So I'm going to be supporting the mayor's budget tonight. I'm not thrilled with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| tax increase, but then I'm not thrilled with paying sales tax either, but I do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| So it's part of the facts of life, I guess, of being a property owner. And I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| that people who are on a lower fixed income do have an opportunity to get tax relief that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| would negate their property taxes. And I think if you're 65 and you make $26,000 or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| you can apply for tax relief and the state of Tennessee will help you address your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| And if you'll call 311, they will direct you to the people who can help you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| But this budget has some things that I might not have in it, some things that Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Della Bope might not have, some things that Councilman Brown might not have. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| other things that I think are great and some things I'd want. So I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| supporting this budget tonight, and I really hope that my colleagues also do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| Thank you. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you, Mayor. I think that we do have a good budget that's been prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| And one thing I think we need to bear in mind in terms of our projects and investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| if we choose to delay them, it's only going to cost more in the long run because of rising costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| So we need to bear that in mind. But I think that nobody wants a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| I'm very mindful of senior citizens and those who are on fixed incomes and those who do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| have a lot of money. But in the long term, I think this is something that's going to be good for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2549)|
| 0:42:38| And we are charged with trying to do the best that we can for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| So I'm going to be supporting the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you. Councilman Saunders. Let me get around to folks who haven't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| Thank you, Mayor. Yeah, I'm very comfortable with this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| I think what's been mentioned by many of my colleagues, two critical words, investment and momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| And that's not a coincidence. Those two things go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| We have been investing for many years and the momentum has been building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| I agree with Councilman Wallace. I think there's some really good things going on in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| in our city, and that we are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And I want very much to do what I can to promote and continue that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| So I will definitely be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Thank you. Councilman Del Valle. Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Well, I appreciate the comments of all my colleagues, and I certainly agree with the concept that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| virtually everything in the budget is useful, helpful, good for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| But again, I come back to the thought that we need to live within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| I've heard some of the comments. If you notice in the information I handed out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| there's not a single cut of employment or cut in services from police, fire, public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| and the other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| There was one item where there was a vacant position, and I thought, well, why should we fund a vacant position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| But there's no change in the regular services the city is performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| But there was an attempt to try to carve out some things that, while nice, don't need to be done all in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| They can be deferred over two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| As everyone knows, we have a capital improvement plan that covers six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| The first year goes into the budget. That's our $27 million in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| The rest of the five years are plans for how we will spend money coming in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| and that gives us a chance to plan ahead and prioritize and figure out how we're going to fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| And I don't see any wrong in if we have a $500,000 project that doesn't have to be one piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| why it couldn't be broken over two years and put partly in the years two to six program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| It seems to me that we're still moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| We're still attacking the things that we think need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| The final point I want to make is that Councilman Pavlis kept saying we didn't have a tax increase in 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| and that's true as to the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| But we all know that it's the rate times the property assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| In 2004, the tax levy was $79 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| In 2013, it was $106 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| We got a $27 million growth in the taxes we've collected and are spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| And so it's a 33 percent increase over those 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| So it's not that we haven't recovered or captured more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| It comes in through the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| And finally, I just think that, again, I think it's important to live in your means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| I don't want the buzz to turn into a buzz saw that hurts us downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| And I think it's a balancing act, and I know that you have worked very hard with your staff to balance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| I'm suggesting I would balance it a little bit more conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| We would have the money in there for the pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| I agree with some of my colleagues it's important to tackle those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| but we're here at this point to fund the current year's pension or the upcoming year's pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| and we're going to have to do it until we change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| I think we have to address that, but this is not the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| The 2.5 percent increase, I was the one that sponsored not making it automatic, but I put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| But, you know, if we have 2 or 3 percent growth in our budget just from cost creep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| and we have the $7 million, I left $11.5 million or $11 million in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| to cover those things and some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| And I'm suggesting that, and apparently as a very small minority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| a $6 million reduction in the ambitious program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| But, again, it's a council of nine folks, and we get to, you know, discuss collegially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| and then make a decision, so that's my point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Okay, we have a motion and a second to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Vice Mayor Pablis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Okay, that motion passes 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| And I'll move on to B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| 9B is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties, real, personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| and mixed within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville to provide sufficient revenues to fund the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| General Fund and Debt Service Fund operations and debt service obligations of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2014 and ending June 30, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| This is, I guess at this point mostly for form, but I would move that we reduce the tax from 34 cents to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| remove 14.5 cents or down to, what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| I guess that would be 19.5 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| Cutting 6 million from the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| I'm not really sure that's an appropriate motion in that the budget has passed with the current appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2889)|
| 0:48:18| I move to amend on the second page of 9B-A that the amount of the tax not be 2.7257 dollars, but be 2, what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2898)|
| 0:48:32| 2.5806 dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| And I move that we change that number as the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| I have to ask the Finance Director if that will meet the budget that has been adopted by Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2918)|
| 0:48:55| Jim York, Finance Director for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| The budget that was just approved is predicated upon the tax rate as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| And if you were to ask me, any change in that proposal would render the first action moot because we wouldn't have sufficient funding to balance the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2945)|
| 0:49:20| Under those circumstances, I do not believe that to be an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2960)|
| 0:49:28| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Is there a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Councilman Delavopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2977)|

| 0:49:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2993)|

| 0:49:56| Before we move on, we have one more item related to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| But I do want to thank Council for all the time and energy you've put into this, for the discussions, the dialogue, the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| I also really want to thank my staff, Jim York, and Christy Branscombe, and Bill Lyons, who spent many, many hours working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3007)|
| 0:50:18| And, of course, all of our department heads who also crunched the numbers and are going to make you all proud as we move forward with this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3018)|

| 0:50:42| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Well, we talked a little bit about this at the budget hearing, and if I understand it right, from Ms. Hatfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3045)|
| 0:50:55| the 2.5% increase is given to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| For those employees that have reached the maximum of their pay level, they get the 2.5% in a bonus, in a one-time bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3059)|
| 0:51:10| of which it does not apply towards their pension, and it would not apply towards, they don't get the increase for their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3070)|
| 0:51:21| And I think, going back to Stair's discussion about the pension, that this furthers the gap in your pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3081)|
| 0:51:32| She said this was a one-year deal, and we'll raise it 2.5% this year, and then next year they'd be entitled to the 2.5% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3092)|
| 0:51:41| assuming it stays there, and then they'd be back up against the cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| So, I don't intend to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| The employees that are up against the cap, they get the 2.5% as a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| It's paid in one lump sum, and it does not continue to divide in the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3112)|
| 0:52:00| So, I intend to not support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3129)|

| 0:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| 9D is an ordinance to amend Chapter 17, Article 2, Division 4, Section 17-98, and Article 6, Division 1, Section 17-301 of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3139)|
| 0:52:29| relating to parking in certain non-metered spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Oh, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Yeah, who could, we probably ought to have a little bit of dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| Would this, would it be Mr. King, or just kind of explain exactly what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| I think Christy Branscom is going to take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Yeah, so we had some non-metered spaces, and we had some inconsistencies in our parking ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| and this was to clean up those inconsistencies regarding ticketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Ron Mills and the legal department revised this particular ordinance so that it's consistent with all parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3181)|
| 0:53:09| Metered will now be consistent with non-metered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| In terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Is there anything you want to add to that, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Really the essence of it was in our metered spaces, after a sufficient period of time had gone by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| and enough tickets had been given, you could tow them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| But we couldn't do that in the non-metered spaces the way the ordinance read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| So we're simply fixing the ordinance to provide that after a certain period of time and enough tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| we can tow those off too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3217)|

| 0:57:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I move we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| There are people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Would you like to hear from them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| We have three signed up for this and three against, so we start with those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| Mr. Seymour, Mr. Salisbury, and Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| Mayor, members of council, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3474)|
| 0:58:04| I am here to speak in favor of the Flournoy proposal for 246 apartments at the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3484)|
| 0:58:14| This project has been a long time getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| As you all know, a town center development, as contemplated for this property, involves retail, commercial, office, and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3498)|
| 0:58:29| In 2004, February 9, 2004, a development plan and standards were submitted to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3509)|
| 0:58:39| and ultimately adopted for the North Shore Town Center, and it set out the elements that would be included in the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3519)|
| 0:58:49| On the residential part, it contemplated and says in the town center development there will be 450 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3529)|
| 0:58:58| These are not exact figures. That's what they put in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| A certain number of townhouses, a certain number of single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| But apartments were a part of the original plan that came up in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| The original developer was interrupted by the recession or depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| which hopefully we're coming out of, and it looks like the city of Knoxville is coming out of very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| The Flournoy process has been a lengthy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| I am going to ask one of my colleagues to deliver to you all a copy of a statement from Margaret Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| who is a resident of the North Shore Town Center, and this was emailed to you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| She explains to you the lengthy process by which she, who originally opposed the Flournoy development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| came to support it and asked you all to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| This process has resulted in a zoning amendment that is before you tonight to rezone or actually change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3604)|
| 1:00:15| the one-year plan, and rezone this property, the planned residential, so as to allow 246 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3615)|
| 1:00:23| Much more importantly, though, it incorporates in the ordinance the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| that Flournoy adhere to the North Shore Town Center development plans architecturally, layout, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3630)|
| 1:00:42| I submit that the plans that have been submitted to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| which will be before it in a couple of weeks, comply with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| and if they don't comply in any way, that they will because MPC is very familiar with the North Shore Town Center guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3652)|
| 1:01:03| I know you will hear from our opponents that Flournoy was involved in a development on Dean Hill Drive at Wesley Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3663)|
| 1:01:13| In 2008, Flournoy, and this can be verified by their engineer, Mr. Salisbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| and Mr. Foster, who is here from Flournoy, did submit a use on review for that apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| It was actually approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| However, Flournoy, upon doing due diligence on the property, determined that it was not suitable for a project they would want to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3691)|
| 1:01:42| and they went and moved their resources to the Amberley Bluff project in the Cheryl Hills area behind Academy Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3702)|
| 1:01:51| which is their other project in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| I submit that last time we were here, two weeks ago, the opponents were very frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3716)|
| 1:02:05| They, at that time, said, and Ms. Klein said, they don't need apartments in this area because people can afford houses or condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3725)|
| 1:02:20| I submit that apartments are very appropriate not only because of the original North Shore Town Center standards and development guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3740)|
| 1:02:31| but also because of the situation the economy is in today where some of the bloom has gone off homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| Apartments are in demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Flournoy is looking forward very much to being a part of the North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| and helping it move forward to the fruition that was originally envisioned in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3767)|
| 1:02:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Mr. Salisbury, please state your name and address for the record, and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| Brad Salisbury, 8550 Kingston Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| Mr. Seymour has done a very good job, as usual, of presenting the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| Here's a resource and to answer any questions that council may have regarding the site plan or engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| And Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Appreciate your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| My name is Ryan Foster, 638 Rocky Shoals Drive, Midland, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| I'm very excited about this project and very passionate about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| and most of all excited to be part of the community, part of the North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| and part of the city of Knoxville once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| If you have any questions for me, just let us know and I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| Okay, now to speak against the project is Eric Harrison, followed by Frank Slagle and Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3836)|
| 1:04:05| Mr. Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| I'm Eric Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| I'm from Morristown, 503 North Jackson Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| As I spoke during the meeting for the first reading a couple of weeks back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| and represent certain citizens in opposition to this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| I won't go ad nauseum through all the legal arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| I detailed those a little bit more last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| I know Mr. Slagle sent an email to all members of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| outlining the various what we think are compelling legal arguments against this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| Those include the illegal spot zoning issue, the issue with the scenic highway designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| and for clarification purposes, we're talking about North Shore, not Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| that area of North Shore very near where this development would be erected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| Also that it's contrary in required modification and amendment of the Knox County General Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| and it doesn't meet specifications for doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| that the change in zoning is arbitrary and unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| and plainly contrary to the existing zoning laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| and finally that it's arbitrary and capricious and without rational basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| given the sector plan already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| For those reasons, and as I spoke before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| we've got a group of people who are very much resolved to follow through opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3923)|
| 1:05:32| to the extent that they can every step of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| We would ask obviously that this not go forward, that the zoning not be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3936)|
| 1:05:45| I've also been asked as a last item by the residents and by my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3945)|
| 1:05:53| and I think it apropos because of some statements that Councilman Grieve made earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| the statement that he read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| they have brought certain concerns to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| and want to bring them to Council's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Regarding the fact that throughout this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| Councilman Grieve has been pretty intimately involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| Obviously he's the one making the motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| and seeming to be most involved on Council in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| There is an email that Mr. Slagle received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| indicating that with respect to the request earlier to delay the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| that Councilman Grieve may have consulted with Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| who's the developer's attorney about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| on whether to vote for that or against to remove for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| It appears to my clients that what has essentially happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| there's video posted on knoxnews.com and some other instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| where publicly and privately that it appears that, to them at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| that Councilman Grieve has become almost a de facto spokesperson or advocate for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4023)|
| 1:07:12| And I don't mean to cast a dispersion in the way that it comes across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| but for the integrity of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| my folks feel it would be appropriate if Councilman Grieve would recuse himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| from voting on this matter going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| And if anybody has any questions, I'm available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Mr. Harrison, are you insinuating that Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| is receiving any type of monetary compensation on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| No, and I take him at face value when he says his firm does no work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| I'm not aware of any such allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| He said that that has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| That's not been brought to my attention at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Has he worked with your clients on this project as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| I know that they have had conversations and meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| So he's worked with both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| I don't know that they would couch it in terms of working with so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| as hearing from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Mr. Slagle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| You have up to five minutes, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Before I get started, I apologize, Duane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| if somebody said something or implied something that wasn't appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| We're like a herd of cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Unfortunately, they're not here with the signs tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| We can't control 27,000 people that live within three miles of this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| Thank you, Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| My name is Frank Slagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| My address is 1924 White Aram Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| I'm sure you're all as tired of seeing me as I am, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Come across as malcontents who can't get along with others because we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| Although I'm the one who has ended up at this podium most of the time for the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| there are hundreds of others that I speak for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| There are over 1,400 signatures on a petition opposing this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| and we delivered that to you all on October 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| and we'd like that included in the record as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| We got those signatures the hard way, door to door, not online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| There are over a dozen neighborhoods and the Council of West Knox County homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| who are opposing this particular proposal for these apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| We have steadfastly maintained that we are not against development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| and we are not against apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| We have always supported every aspect of North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| Our neighborhoods may be on the other side of the fence from the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| but we are all Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| We are neighbors and part of the same community regardless of where the dividing lines are drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4184)|
| 1:09:53| Tonight I'd like to correct a few mistakes in the information you were provided two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| You were told there would be no retaining walls on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Some walls that are already in place will be unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| because the level of the site will be raised ten feet where the walls are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| The main retaining wall that is currently in place will remain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| according to our discussion with Brad from Cannon & Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| It's a 12 to 15-foot wall in the middle of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| and it will be left to support one of the streets and hover over the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| Also, the question about designated scenic highway restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| appears to have been mishandled in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| The scenic highway in question is not Pellissippi Parkway but North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| and according to Dan Kelly at MPC, the scenic highway regulations are overseen by TDOT, not MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| In addition, there's been a lot of talk about the apartment development on Dean Hill Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| and the overbearing retaining walls that are part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| We've provided you some pictures tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| We've provided each of you a picture of the site and, more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| a copy of the use on review report from 2008 when this project was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| I think it's interesting to note that the applicant on this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| is the same developer that is asking for the rezoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| I don't know what twists and turns the Wellesley Park Apartments took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| and what role Flournoy and its successors have in that project today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| but we do know that they are the ones who started that development rolling to what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| Who knows what twists and turns this proposed development in North Shore Town Center will bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| but I think it's safe to say there's a chance that things can change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| between now and the completion of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| The residents of Beaumont even included in their list of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| that were necessary for their capitulation that, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| require Flournoy and any successor in interest to Flournoy agree to the followed design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| Once the rezoning is approved, all sorts of changes can be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| and this body has no say in how the development will eventually be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| Please resist subjecting our community to an oversized development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| shoehorned in next to our mature neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Please support the general plan 2033 that assures us this kind of incompatible development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| will not abut conventional suburban development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| Please resist the temptation to put the prospect of municipal enrichment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| above the commitments that were made to us in 2010 by both MPC and City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| to maintain TC1 zoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| Whatever you decide tonight, we know this is not the end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| We realize this isn't even the beginning of the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| It's only the end of the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| We would prefer to work with Flournoy on a suitable plan, but if they can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| we're willing to work with the next developer on a plan that will enhance our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| and for the benefit of the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| In conclusion, we've been over backwards for the past 10 years to try to be good neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| to this tiny piece of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Now we're asking that you be good neighbors to our community and vote against this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| and let this developer pursue one of the better options for this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| one that is better for the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Have I got any time for rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| You've got 35 seconds left right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| I'll say just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| No, but you have to say it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Oh, I wanted to rebut if he said something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| No, that's not the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| But if council wants to call on you for anything there, you have the opportunity then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| Okay, so Margo Klein, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| Ms. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you, and I know it's a late evening and you all have put a lot of work in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| And like Frank, I'm not that happy to be taking your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| but I'm here representing the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| My name is Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| And I also want to apologize to Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Although we have concerns, I was not aware that anyone made any particular pointed allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| Had nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Didn't know about it, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| I was going to talk to you a little bit about an email I sent asking for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| and giving all the reasons, but I did send you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| So I know it's in the record, and I know some of you have read it because I got responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| It really doesn't just have to do with North Shoretown Center Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| The issue at hand is that there are four apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| that have been recommended for approval by MPC along the exits at Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4475)|
| 1:14:44| And this is, as I said, one of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| All of these are large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| This is the only one that happens to be inside the city limits due to annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| The other three are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| One of those other three has already gone all the way to total approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| and there has been a lawsuit filed against the county and the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| taking that to a higher court for a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| It's my knowledge, I actually worked on Plan ET development from its outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| I worked at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work, Office of Research and Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| I'm very aware of the planning that went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| I'm very aware that that was a planning grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| I'm also aware that in the past few months that money has been used up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| And, of course, the MPC would like to see some of the planning come to life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| and so there are implementation measures that appear to be put in place without any public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4537)|
| 1:15:45| And the request for a postponement is for the entirety of this concept of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4545)|
| 1:15:54| Pellissippi Parkway being the main street for Blount and Anderson counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| and for high-density residential to be put at all of these exits up and down Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| to be put before the public in a forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| in the same sense that discussions were held on the South Waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| We are not opposed to apartments at North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| We're opposed to apartments at this specific location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| with this proximity to housing that is not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| As representative of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| I hear a lot from individuals in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| we do not represent a town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| We do not represent anyone inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| However, we shop and most of us work inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| And as Frank said, we're all together in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| We want this North Shore Town Center to be a really good development that meets needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| and we want a reasonable amount of time to be given to looking at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| That's really what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| The Council of West Knox County Homeowners has been in existence for more than 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| and I talked to many people who have very different views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| Many people called me everything but the devil in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| because I actually think a lot of the plan E.T. planning is wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| and if you read the playbook, it sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| The way it's executed makes all the difference, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| And right now, like I said, it looks like it's being executed without enough input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| A lot of people in the county will come to meetings and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| you know, we have this agricultural property next to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| and they want to put 30 houses on it, and they live in a neighborhood with 30 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| And I have to look at them and say, they're asking to rezone to put exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| You have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| To put the same type of housing that you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| It's compatible zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| There's no way you're going to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| We don't even go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| But this appears to be very incompatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4684)|

| 1:18:11| Yes, we just want to clarify a couple of things were mentioned that you wanted as part of the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| and we need to make sure Ms. Mitchell gets that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| So, Margo, you had your e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| Can you forward, make sure Ms. Mitchell gets it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| And, Mr. Slagle, didn't you mention something as part of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| It was filed back in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| We do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Just wanted to verify, make sure we had all that you wanted as part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| So we've heard from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| I didn't know if there was a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Well, not in a, that's only an appeal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| That's only during an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| First of all, Frank and Margo, I appreciate what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| And also to the attorney, I want him to understand that, first of all, I'm a firm believer in the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| And part of the public process has to do with dealing with both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| And I have always been very careful to make sure that information that is sent to me from either side is forwarded to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4752)|
| 1:19:20| And when Mr. Slagle asked me about a postponement, I felt it was important to contact the other parties to see what their feeling was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4760)|
| 1:19:29| It had nothing to do that I was representing them in any way in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| And I think that Margo can especially attest to the fact of what I did with Cheryl Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| I've often said that I don't know where the boundaries are between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| And that I try very hard to work with both the neighborhoods, whether they're within the city or without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| And I think Margo can attest to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| And I think this is a situation where we have a disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| But Margo, as you know, we're going to move forward and we'll be on the same sides on other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| And on this particular issue, we just have a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| And so I look forward to continuing to work with both of you and also with the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| I know that some of them are a little bit upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| But hopefully we can get over this and move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| And I appreciate what you two had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=4817)|

| 1:24:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Oh, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| And I think Mr. Wells, David Wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| I spoke with Mr. Wells this afternoon and really at the last council meeting Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5048)|
| 1:24:24| Grieve raised this question and quite honestly when I looked at it before I had quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5064)|
| 1:24:35| of oversight on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| So I went back out there today and looked at it again and I have a few questions I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| I'm worried about the commercial creep also into the neighborhood when there's C3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| on North Central already and taking these really two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| One they've already they're using as a parking lot I guess or driveway and then these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| additional ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| So Mark they've asked for C3 and I guess is that what they have to have for a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| or could they have something less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Because given them C3 zoning that far up Emerald Avenue certainly opens it up for more creep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| up that way and it doesn't permit them or would it permit them to build a building on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| C3 at any time they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| So I'd like for you to speak to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| Mark Donaldson with NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| If the property is zoned to C3 they would have the right to construct a building for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5128)|
| 1:25:37| commercial purposes without any further review by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| The C3 is a logical extension of the existing zoning that is adjacent to the to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5144)|
| 1:25:52| to the southwest and half of the property to the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| The proposed use is identical to the current use of the property immediately across Emerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5157)|
| 1:26:06| which is a parking lot that serves the Emerald Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| The conditions that were attached by the Planning Commission would limit access to that parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5173)|
| 1:26:21| lot expansion from the existing alley so there would be no further driveway cuts on Emerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| and there would be a landscape buffer along the adjacent private property and along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5187)|
| 1:26:35| Emerald Avenue right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| But with C3 which is a basic zone district once zoned there is no further review by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| Planning Commission for any improvements on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| Was there anything else that could be zoned to that would allow them to use it as parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| but prohibit commercial development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| I have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| Sorry, I didn't give you enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Generally we need to get into the commercial districts to allow an off-site parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| but the planned commercial might be appropriate so we'll have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| Would the planned commercial allow for what would require a use zone review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| And the issue would be whether a commercial parking lot is called out as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5246)|
| 1:27:36| I spoke to Mr. Wells this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| I told him it's not intended to be anything against the Emerald Youth but I just see the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| creep right on down Emerald and there's really no boundary that you could defend for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5265)|
| 1:27:54| There's three more properties in between there and the next cross street, McMillan Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5274)|
| 1:28:04| I think it's too much when you've already got commercial creep into that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Councilman Graves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| One of the questions, and Mark, I apologize for not getting with you today on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| but you mentioned about the parking lot across from this which is behind the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| What is its zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I believe it's one of the residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| It's probably been there for longer than we've had a zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| Well, again, the reason I brought this up last time is that I just feel that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| again, it's sort of like Councilman Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| We have commercial creep into a neighborhood and this appears to be a fairly stabilized neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5317)|
| 1:28:45| and what I'm concerned about is that if there's some way that the foundation can still get parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| but yet at the same time we keep the zoning, I'm just concerned that one thing's going to lead to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| and eventually we're going to see this creep all the way down into this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| So that's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| I expressed that the last time and express it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| I'm definitely not opposed to Emerald Youth Foundation or them having their necessary parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| but I am concerned from the neighborhood standpoint in terms of what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| on that whole line going down through there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| The C3 zone district is one of the very few that does call out commercial parking lots as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5362)|
| 1:29:31| and the opinion of the city administration is that if it's called out in one zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| and not mentioned in another, then it's not permitted in the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| So that's why C3 was selected for that particular proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| because it is independent of associated property so the parking lot is the principal use on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5387)|
| 1:30:01| Okay, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| I respect your concerns about this and coming into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| I feel like Emerald Youth has shown commitment by having, I believe, a 12-foot landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5411)|
| 1:30:21| Kind of makes their parking area finite and will protect the residential areas immediately to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5421)|
| 1:30:35| Sure, we want to protect our neighborhoods and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| but I think they've shown commitment to drawing that line and not letting it creep further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| I mean, any business and commercial area in a gray site or potentially gray area like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| we could be scared that they're going to continue to encroach onto the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| but I think they've done their work and I'll take their word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| Thank you. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| Yes, I asked last time. I want to ask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| I guess I'll ask Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Have you heard of any opposition in the neighborhoods concerning that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| I asked Mr. Wells the same thing today and he said the neighbor immediately impacted was very concerned, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5473)|
| 1:31:22| and rightly so initially, but after speaking to Mr. Wells, and he can reiterate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| but he said they've talked about it and he's accepting of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Councilman Graves, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Well, again, as I think I mentioned the last time, the concern that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| there's no doubt that these folks are good neighbors and good neighbors to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| but I think one of the things that we on Council have to do is we have to look to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and we don't know that these folks are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| I mean, they say they're going to be there for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| but what's going to happen in ten years and what's going to happen to this neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| And so I think that one of the reasons that we have zoning is to draw lines and draw lines of demarcation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5516)|
| 1:32:04| and I think this is a situation where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| if I were a business on down on the other side of the church and I needed parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| I would certainly come, and I don't know, Mark, what you all would end up saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| if I took the three lots behind those businesses on the other side of the church and said I need parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| and then City Council says, no, you can't have parking there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| then I think that, you know, we're kind of in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| So I just think that we need to think seriously about what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| and if there's some way they can get parking in an R1 or something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| that would be my preference on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| But I am concerned about not only the present day and not only the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| and not only Emerald Youth but also in terms of the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| and what's going to happen with that whole corridor going down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| All right, we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| All right, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5576)|

| 1:33:02| Two no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| There are two no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| Okay, Grieve and Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5584)|

| 1:36:33| and I'll continue to follow through both again being impartial and in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| But I did mean to mention that, that I know that they are going to continue to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5799)|

| 1:37:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| My address is 1805 Bird Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| I was here two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| I started planning the seed for my safe transport program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| I'm going to help get you all to dream with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| The most important point I forgot two weeks ago was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| We see how the economy's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| We see how people kill themselves to go out and have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5828)|
| 1:37:20| What we're not seeing is that by developing this safe transport service, we literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| hung going out to have a good time in Knoxville to Friday and Saturday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| The benefits of this are overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Number one, we start addressing weekly drinking, drinking everyday alcoholism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| We start eliminating people who could be potential alcoholics by gearing them to go out just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| They stay home through the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| They spend more family time together through the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| So in listening to the budget, I heard that word enough times this evening, I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| run out the door and I have nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| I initially proposed this program to be for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| Looking at the budget, knowing I don't want seniors to pay for this in any way, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| charge the normal bus fee for the buses to run Friday and Saturday evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| And in addition to helping drivers to come out and volunteer for this program, give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| a small tax break for drivers who can show they put six months volunteer time into driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| In addition to the $2 million you want to come up for that $34 million loan, a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| tax, a small tax increase for liquor by the drink, because who's going to profit the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| from a free or a Friday, Saturday evening transport service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| The people who sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| So a tax increase for liquor by the drink will help the city with all their other needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| I'm going to stop taking your time and attention this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| Everybody have a great evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Ms. Reed, I would recommend right there is Hubert Smith, who's a member of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| Transportation Authority, and if there's any new bus services to be planned, his KTA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| would be the ones who would bring that, would make those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| So I'm sure Mr. Smith would be glad to talk to you to get more information about your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5949)|

| 1:39:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| So this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140527?start=5955)|
