|     370 |   381 | We obviously couldn't get out of there without recognizing Mr. Vandeveidt for all the work he's done from the conception of this committee up until last month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=370.0)  |
|     381 |   390 | We appreciate all of his efforts, basically taking this committee from the foundation up and bringing it to where it is now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=381.0)  |
|     390 |   396 | And we really appreciate everything he did for us there and he did for the committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=390.0)  |
|     397 |   405 | Also, with the retirement of Larry Hutzel as the emergency response coordinator for the health department, Steve Hamby has since filled that role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=397.0)  |
|     405 |   408 | And that is also a position on the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=405.0)  |
|     408 |   413 | So we're happy to have Steve there and we welcome his input as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=408.0)  |
|     413 |   421 | At the committee, we presented the CTAS report, which you all got to see, an abbreviated version of what we looked at there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=413.0)  |
|     421 |   426 | Some 9-1-1 dispatch protocols were gone over for our respective agencies within the county.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=421.0)  |

|     559 |   570 | They also participated in over 1,300 hours of training which included technical training, rope, collapse, trench, confined space, things of that nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=559.0)  |
|     570 |   578 | Knox County Rescue has developed a recruitment video that they have put out to try to encourage folks to volunteer for their organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=570.0)  |
|     578 |   587 | And their specialty teams have completed over 100 hours of training in the last 90 days, again for their technical, the trench, the collapse, the rope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=578.0)  |
|     587 |   594 | A lot of those specialty teams, as you may know, those are low frequency, which means they don't happen often.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=587.0)  |
|     594 |   601 | And they're very high risk events, which they can, usually the victim is hurt pretty bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=594.0)  |
|     601 |   604 | And it has potential to get the responders hurt as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=601.0)  |
|     604 |   608 | So training is the utmost for those types of events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=604.0)  |
|     608 |   610 | They don't happen very often.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=608.0)  |
|     610 |   614 | So really the way you get the experience is by doing the repetitive training over and over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=610.0)  |
|     614 |   619 | And the rescue squad still continues to be a springboard for folks who are interested in emergency services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=614.0)  |
|     620 |   625 | It's a great place to volunteer and get your foot in the door, so to speak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=620.0)  |
|     625 |   630 | As I mentioned earlier, Rural Metro has done a ton of public education events over the last three months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=625.0)  |
|     630 |   633 | Now the weather's, I say, getting warmer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=630.0)  |
|     633 |   636 | I don't know, I think it went from zero to 90.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=633.0)  |
|     636 |   643 | So they're out in the subdivisions educating the public, talking to the kids, trying to get that safety message out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=636.0)  |

|     648 |   657 | These folks on this task force have had what we call red card training, or the official level of wild land emergency training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=648.0)  |

|     673 |   679 | They've got the room out there to house that equipment, and the space around the firehouse is a great place to train.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=673.0)  |

|    1334 |  1338 | The charge should weigh, and you also have to take into account the defendant's rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1334.0) |

|    1717 |  1724 | So I was able to build my practice from really the bottom of the ocean, essentially.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1717.0) |
|    1724 |  1728 | So my primary practice is really two areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1724.0) |
|    1728 |  1730 | It's family law and it's criminal defense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1728.0) |
|    1730 |  1733 | Now, how does that work with the magistrate's office?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1730.0) |
|    1733 |  1737 | The magistrate's office is the first stop whenever somebody is arrested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1733.0) |
|    1737 |  1746 | It's the determining whether or not the warrant has enough probable or has established probable cause in order to send that warrant up to the general sessions court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1737.0) |
|    1746 |  1753 | If the magistrate does not find probable cause, the magistrate has a duty to dismiss that warrant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1746.0) |
|    1753 |  1764 | It is important to have a magistrate who has criminal history background or a background in criminal defense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1753.0) |
|    1764 |  1784 | But it's important to have somebody who has actually been in the general sessions courts who has talked to the district attorneys, the assistant district attorneys, to negotiate the plea negotiations and to examine those warrants with the DA to ensure that maybe it's something that the magistrate should have dismissed or maybe it's not quite what the charge was and it should be reduced to a lesser sentence. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1764.0) |
|    1784 |  1789 | So for the past few years, I have pretty much lived in the general sessions courts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1784.0) |
|    1789 |  1794 | And I have not only done general sessions courts, but I've also been in the criminal courts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1789.0) |
|    1794 |  1799 | In fact, I had a second-degree murder trial just about two or three weeks ago that wrapped up in Anderson County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1794.0) |
|    1799 |  1804 | So I've done the whole process of the criminal – essentially criminal litigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1799.0) |
|    1804 |  1808 | Now, why is it also important to practice in family law?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1804.0) |
|    1808 |  1818 | The importance there is to understand that there's something called an ex parte when you file for an order of protection, and we do that all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1808.0) |
|    1818 |  1823 | And it's my understanding that the magistrate's office does review petitions for order of protections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1818.0) |

|    1942 |  1944 | Have you ever been convicted of a crime?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1942.0) |
|    1944 |  1945 | Never.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1944.0) |
|    1945 |  1946 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1945.0) |
|    1946 |  1948 | You said you took the training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1946.0) |
|    1948 |  1952 | Can you elaborate on that and why you never did officially substitute?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1948.0) |
|    1952 |  1953 | Yeah, yeah, absolutely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1952.0) |
|    1953 |  1959 | So the training – so how it started was I heard that you can become a magistrate office or a substitute magistrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1953.0) |
|    1959 |  1962 | So I called the magistrate's office to see if they had any availability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1959.0) |
|    1962 |  1967 | That's when Chief Magistrate Christopher Rowe informed me that there was a training that you can do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1962.0) |
|    1967 |  1973 | So one night at his 7 o'clock shift – I think it was a Saturday – excuse me, a Thursday – I go down to the magistrate's office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1967.0) |
|    1973 |  1974 | He sits me down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1973.0) |
|    1974 |  1978 | He shows me the gyms program that they use, shows me how to conduct the arraignment,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1974.0) |
|    1978 |  1983 | shows me how the process is for the officer to come in and review the warrant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1978.0) |
|    1983 |  1987 | and essentially make sure that the warrant meets the probable cause standard that's required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1983.0) |
|    1987 |  1993 | And I didn't stay the whole shift, but I stayed enough to see what the process was,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1987.0) |
|    1993 |  2000 | and I felt comfortable enough where I told Chief Rowe that I'd like to continue with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1993.0) |

|    2378 |  2386 | The application process is applicants, there was a notice put in the Bar Association publication,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2378.0) |
|    2386 |  2390 | and applicants turned in their resumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2386.0) |
|    2390 |  2397 | They would, in the normal course, apply with County Commission to be appointed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2390.0) |
|    2397 |  2401 | and then they'd have to be approved by the five sessions judges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2397.0) |
|    2401 |  2407 | Historically, some years ago, County Commission chose to approach the judges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2401.0) |
|    2407 |  2410 | and say we have this pool of applicants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2407.0) |
|    2410 |  2417 | Instead of us appointing folks that you would not approve, give us a list of who you would approve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2410.0) |

|    3127 |  3135 | Now, as it happens, in the 1970 federal census, Knox County had a population between 276,000 and 277,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3127.0) |
|    3135 |  3139 | So this was clearly aimed at Knox County and no other county.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3135.0) |
|    3139 |  3143 | Now, so that's where you get the authority to appoint the magistrates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3139.0) |
|    3143 |  3154 | But when you go down to 41-111, subparagraph small c, what it says is that notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3143.0) |

|    3175 |  3180 | So this is a provision that appears to be unique to Knox County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3175.0) |

|    3183 |  3185 | Judge Cerny might be able to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3183.0) |
|    3185 |  3187 | But in any event, that's what we're working with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3185.0) |
|    3187 |  3193 | So the appointment authority is yours, but with the consent of the judges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3187.0) |

|    3222 |  3233 | So in a nutshell, what I'm understanding about this process is you all have sent us two candidates that you feel like are the best applicants for the position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3222.0) |
|    3233 |  3245 | And, in effect, those are our two that we need to choose from because if we do not, if we choose another applicant, that it will be overridden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3233.0) |

|    3524 |  3525 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3524.0) |

|    3526 |  3536 | So in looking at his resume, it says he's been a substitute magistrate for approximately three years,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3526.0) |
|    3536 |  3545 | and he's one of the three that you guys call on, and he did fill out an application to be considered,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3536.0) |
|    3545 |  3553 | and apparently with over 145 shifts, that's pretty substantial, I would guess, as a substitute magistrate,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3545.0) |
|    3553 |  3562 | but yet the judges want him to be a substitute but not a judicial magistrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3553.0) |

|    3989 |  3992 | Well, that's what this resolution is seeking to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3989.0) |

|    3993 |  4000 | Since 2019, if I recall correctly, the legislature has given to regional planning commissions the authority to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3993.0) |

|    4003 |  4013 | And last year, in 2022, a bill passed that made that contingent on approval by the county legislative body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4003.0) |
|    4013 |  4017 | Unfortunately, this bill kind of slipped under the radar, and nobody saw it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4013.0) |
|    4017 |  4022 | So what we're doing with this resolution is providing that authority going forward                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4017.0) |
|    4022 |  4026 | and also retroactive to the date that the bill became effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4022.0) |
|    4026 |  4032 | And I think, and I don't know if our planning commission director is here or not,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4026.0) |
|    4032 |  4040 | I believe that there are plans to also go back and reconfirm some of the plaques that were approved during this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4032.0) |
|    4040 |  4044 | interim period so that there won't be a problem with them going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4040.0) |
|    4044 |  4046 | So this is corrective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4044.0) |
|    4046 |  4056 | It's unfortunate that it was missed, but I think with the passage of this resolution, we can fix the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4046.0) |

|    4117 |  4122 | Did you want to kind of give us a little more history and what's going on and how this affects your department?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4117.0) |

|    4127 |  4133 | There's no other, I mean, I think that Director Moyers laid it out accurately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4127.0) |
|    4133 |  4140 | I would say, you know, if the, I can give you like what happens if you approve it versus if you don't approve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4133.0) |

|    4251 |  4262 | As we discussed and as Director Moyers alluded to, there were 26 plots of 26 or more that have been approved since this change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4251.0) |
|    4262 |  4267 | And one thing that I did ask of Director Brooks is that those would be publicly noticed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4262.0) |
