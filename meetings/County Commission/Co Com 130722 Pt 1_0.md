| 0:01:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| First item, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Deferred discussion and possible action against beer permittees who have violated Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| Beer Laws pertaining to the sale or possession of untaxed alcoholic beverages unlawful, TCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| Subsection 57-3-304, Jeffrey Behrens, J.B.'s Creekside Tavern, 7428 Clinton Highway, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=120)|
| 0:02:09| and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Mr. Behrens, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| Go ahead, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Mr. Behrens, the procedure here today is we will ask the Sheriff's Department to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| and bring forth the testimony in regard to your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| After the testimony is given, then you will be able to stand and either affirm or deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| and then present the facts from your side to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| They will be turned over to this board, and they will then deliberate, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| I'm going to ask the Sheriff's Office for some testimony before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| On March 15, 2013, Knox County Sheriff Beer Inspector was conducting a walk-through at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=167)|
| 0:03:00| Creekside Tavern, 7428 Clinton Highway, that's PAL, when two-quart jar glass-containing moonshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=180)|
| 0:03:11| was found in a freezer in the back room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| Mr. Behrens was cited for possession of illegal alcohol untaxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=197)|
| 0:03:29| Mr. Behrens, if you will, your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| There's not much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Do we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| I'd like to ask the question of the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Law Director, what are our choices to do in this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| Well, from the civil side, this is a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| I didn't get testimony as a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| They are not a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| So the penalty is the standard, if you want it, up to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=237)|
| 0:04:08| What about this letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| He was mentioning a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Oh, he got a letter, and it was to bring him here is what he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| It said for the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Oh, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| You can have a letter of first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Is that what you all wanted to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| And put it in his file for 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Or you can go with the first offense as under the other offense rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| So he can have a letter just in the file or the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| For notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Or any other up to $1,000 or, what is it, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=285)|
| 0:04:54| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| This is an unusual one that we don't usually have this type of an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Usually it's another offense kind of that we're always aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| This one has a ---- and it allows us to give a letter of admonishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| It allows us to do the first offense rule for a nonresponsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| And so that's kind of where you are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| You can deliberate it any way you want to, truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Is he a ---- was this a routine inspection or did you have knowledge that they were selling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| or did it just become aware on an inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| I received an email on Saturday, February 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| It says, at Creekside Tavern and Pal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| witness a bartender serve a group of underage kids alcohol for about an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| After, we witnessed two women snorting some drug in the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| as well as two men exchanging money in bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| This place should be shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| And it was anonymous, sent in to the sheriff's hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| and that's why we did the walkthrough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Did the ABC, was the ABC involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| I'm not really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| ABC was with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Did they take any action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| No, because they don't have a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| I did all the charging through Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Has that been adjudicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| It's been agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| He agreed two weeks ago when we were in court that he was going to plead in criminal sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=386)|
| 0:06:35| and then come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Is there a fine involved in criminal sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Or is it dismissed upon payment of cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| They've not done it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| We haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| That won't be until Thursday, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| But he has agreed to come today with the knowledge that he will plead guilty on the next court date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=409)|
| 0:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| I'm not worried about the anonymous e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| If they don't put their name on it, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Sure, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| I mean, we're 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| We're a smoking environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| We card everyone no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| I can promise you there were no minors in the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| We've carded everybody since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| You know, and I pushed out when I was over at Brickyard Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| I never would let anybody in without an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| And I would definitely not serve minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| And sort of a follow-up on Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Earlier, as you were speaking, this is not in connection then with an underage attempted buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Well, I understand everything that's going to be said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| There was an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| And I don't think a letter is nearly severe enough for selling, you know, moonshine in a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| Well, that has moonshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| I don't want to get into a back-and-forth with you, but if it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| If it's there and you're selling beverages of the alcoholic nature, I'm a fairly reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=490)|
| 0:08:19| I would not think you're bringing it there to serve to your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| That is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| And you're not going to convince me otherwise, so don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| I mean, but my point is I don't think a simple letter at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| I think this is egregious enough that we should do a fine of some type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| I think the typical first offense is $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| So I'm going to make a motion that we have a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| But I'm going to get fined in the criminal court, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| I mean, this is a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| I don't work with the criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| There is a matter that's brought before us, and that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| It may not pass here, but that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| We've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| I'd like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Jeff, you know, you ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| That was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Yes, I said second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I agree with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| You know, Jeff, this is not the first time something's happened there at the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| We really need to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| I have cleaned it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| I've run all the pill pushers and everybody out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| We've got new businesses coming all around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| You've got that new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| You've got people behind you today that are building a very first-class upscale store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| And it's going to reflect on your business, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| So ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| I've cleaned that place up, as you guys have all noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| There's, you know, I've painted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| I've done everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| And we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| We appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| I've done everything he's asked me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| And they're going to be on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| So just sort of watch it because we want it done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| So I second the motion, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=600)|

| 0:10:13| It's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| How long do I have to pay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=618)|

| 0:10:23| The old courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=623)|

| 0:10:54| Give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| She can get an interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=657)|

| 0:11:11| He's going to have to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Speak into the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Adrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Mr. Chair, I think he had asked earlier if she could get an interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Is that what you asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| And this is Ms. Pedro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Mr. Law Director, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Adrian, are you going to interpret for Ms. Pedro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Can you get someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Where's Mike Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| I don't think we have an interpreter present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Does she not speak English at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Then I think we probably will need to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| and try to make arrangements for an interpreter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| because she needs due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| needs to understand what she's being accused of and be able to dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| I will move that we defer this matter until the next board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=731)|

| 0:12:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Would you convey to Ms. Pedro that she's got to have an interpreter here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| with her next month for us to go through this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=741)|

| 0:17:00| Mr. Wren, go ahead and state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| My name is Denny Wren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I reside at 12224 West Ashton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Commission, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Several months ago, I submitted an application online for a job with the Knox County Schools for a position of security guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| On June 20th, I was contacted by the security office and asked if I'd like to interview for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| I accepted the offer and was scheduled for the following morning, June 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| The interview was conducted by Dr. Russell and Chief Pedousis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| I felt the interview went extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| During the interview, I was asked if there was anything keeping me from accepting the position if it was offered to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| I said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| I told both of them I had a family wedding planned at the end of July, 1st of August for a family member that I had to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1072)|
| 0:18:01| I already had flight, car, and hotel reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| And I was told that if I was chosen, they would somehow work around my plans and that family was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| That same morning, two and a half hours later, I received a phone call with an email stating I had been accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| and to show up for orientation on Monday, June 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| I went to orientation that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| It took all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| And during the orientation, we were instructed on the policies and procedures of the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| along with a drug test and a psychological evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| We were told that we would be contacted by Friday evening if for some reason we had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| Friday came and went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| I didn't hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| We were told no news is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| So I showed up for our first day of training, Monday, July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| During the first hour of training, it was noted that several of us had mustaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and we needed to shave them off before returning back to class on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| There was a little bit of confusion because the instructor had a mustache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| He was a Knox County School security guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| He said they were okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| One said they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| One said they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Anyway, it was ruled by the chief later that during the five weeks of training, no mustaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| During that same first day, we went over the schedule for the five weeks of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| And the date of August 5th was mentioned as being a very important day of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| That was supposed to be the last day on my vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| So after the first day of training, I went home, shaved off my mustache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| and explained to my wife we needed to change our flight reservations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| and come home a day earlier because I didn't want to miss training on August 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| And I don't know if any of you have ever changed your flight reservations at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| It gets rather expensive, especially for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| Well, I returned to training the following morning, Tuesday, with no mustache and ready to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| And right before our lunch break, several names were called out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| and we were told that they needed to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| I wasn't sure exactly how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I believe it was ten people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| I assumed that they wanted to talk to me about my vacation schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| and go over the days that I was going to be missing and how to make them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| That wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| One by one, each person went into a room, came out, turned in all their handouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| turned in their ID badges, and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| Since my name starts with W, I was the last to be called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| I knew they were calling me in to go over my vacation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| That wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| I was told I could no longer go forward in the process and that I was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| I asked why, and I was told they didn't give a reason, nor did they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| I asked again, and the same thing was told to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| They couldn't tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| I also asked when they knew something was wrong, and I was told late Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| This was prior to us starting our training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| I went out to the parking lot with several others who were just let go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| and nobody seemed to know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| With our jaws wide open and hanging to the ground, we all left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Upon getting home, I sent an e-mail to Chief Pedusas, Dr. McIntyre, and to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| asking to meet and gather some answers that I felt I deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| On July the 8th, Chief Pedusas called me and told me the reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| I didn't have consistency with my answers on the psych test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| I have yet to hear back from the other two offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Now I know that every employer has the right to test as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| I also understand Tennessee is a right-to-work state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1293)|

| 0:21:40| What I don't understand is why we all started before the results were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| I know of no other employer that operates like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Unlike what you may have read, psych test is not a pass or fail type test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| There are no right or wrong answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| It's a profile exam to see if the exam taker meets the profile of the type of individual you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| Here are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Eight to ten of the current guards wouldn't pass or meet the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| In fact, with the size of this commission, two or three of you wouldn't meet the qualification either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| Mr. Wren, our limits are five minutes, and you've already gone past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| Could I have two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1340)|

| 0:22:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| I know that speaking publicly about this process has ruined my chances of getting another job with the county forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| but I feel that those other people let go deserve a better chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Those are people who didn't hear anything until they had already started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| and been told that they would hear something prior to starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Here's my employment history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| I served in the United States Air Force and received an honorable discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| I spent 26 years as a firefighter paramedic with a class one fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| one of only 40 departments in the entire nation with a class one rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| Not only the highest rated, highest trained also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Thirty years of public service with the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I have been in the public eye for most of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| During those years, I have received numerous awards for outstanding service, hard work, and helping others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| I was a volunteer assistant coach with the eighth grade Farragut football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Mr. Wren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Sorry, I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| I'm sorry that you are out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| Let me just ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Did the applicants for county trustee take a psychological exam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you, Mr. Wren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Also on public forum, we have Andy Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1410)|

| 0:23:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| And the subject being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| Public forum also Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Mr. Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Mr. Wheeler, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| My name is Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I live on 2631 Bakertown Road in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| I've been a taxpayer and a resident of Knox County for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| I've seen a lot come and seen a lot go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| What I want to speak to this morning or this afternoon is the upcoming agenda item that has to do with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:32| I know that there have been 20-odd people that applied for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Some have given presentations and some haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| But I also know that one of the gentlemen just spoke a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| have spoke to the commission about the process in terms of selecting a replacement for Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:56| It would seem to me, with the issues that have evolved out of that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1496)|
| 0:25:05| that we might want to give careful consideration to appointing someone who has ideas about running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:16| in some time period for that job, not just a caretaker, but someone who is interested in running for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:26| I think that's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| There's been enough problems in that office right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| that we need to take a closer look at and perhaps identify someone on the slate here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| that has no interest in running for the job after 14 August 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| and, secondly, is more interested in bringing some trust to that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| I need not say what's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I don't know, but I still think that there needs to be a clean slate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| that whoever takes over that office needs to be squeaky clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| I thank the commission for the time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Now, I think I had a couple other one other person signed up, Ms. Absher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| I think she wants to speak also to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| So, Mr. Andrew and Ms. Absher, we'll just hold those until the item comes up on the agenda, if that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Let's move to our honoraria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1595)|

| 0:26:53| And I believe they're in the back corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=1617)|

| 0:36:03| Thanks, Commissioners and ladies and gentlemen in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| My first exposure to Ms. Pionke on a professional level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| other than just sort of the routine meetings where we encounter sometimes some of the folks from the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:20| of course, was during the Ridge Top and Steep Slope Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| And Ms. Pionke worked in that task force on various committees for years, as you all suffered through this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:37| And in that process, I came to know her pretty well, not only in terms of her professional ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| but just how she truly cares about this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| and she uses her great skill and expertise at trying to make this a better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| And she does it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| So I greatly appreciate her, and it's my honor to sign on to this honorarium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| So I greatly appreciate her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:15| I just want to say thank you for the recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| and nothing can really surpass when it was announced to me that I had won the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| And back in April at our professional conference, because I was stunned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| and I believe I forgot to thank my husband at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| So I'd like to take that opportunity to do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Cindy, we want to take this time to thank you because you go to a lot of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| and you've got developers on one side and you've got citizens on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| and both are very opinionated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| And you come in and say, here's what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| And I've seen you do that several times in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| And you're very professional in what you do, and you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| I've enjoyed working with you as an NPC commissioner and as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| So you're one of our great, great employees that we have here for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you for the kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2293)|

| 0:38:40| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| I have with me four gentlemen who have received the medal that my dad said he never wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:53| This is a Purple Heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| These men were injured in combat in the defense of our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| It would be appropriate, maybe our veterans could come down here and stand with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I know you have some veterans on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Would that be appropriate, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| It's giving Knox County would be the first county in the state to have this designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| as officially a Purple Heart County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| It will be on our letterhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| And to me, it just sends a positive message to our veterans that we appreciate what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| This is just a small piece of gratitude we can give to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| So, any of our veterans, Arthur, you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Is that okay, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| I would like to say, many of our young people are listing, maybe back at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| if you're not in front of your computer, your Game Boy right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| that everything we have in our country we owe to these men that are standing behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And I just want to say I have a complete debt of gratitude to my uncle, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| If you come into my office, 48 star flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| He was awarded the Purple Heart posthumously about 14 days after D-Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| And, of course, my father fought, but he never got the Purple Heart, thank goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Mr. Mayor, I don't think any of us went looking for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| And if you would give your name to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| My name, I am Arthur McGinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2417)|

| 0:40:38| Let them vote on it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| You all want to go ahead and vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| We already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Yeah, I thought they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Let me present this to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| In addition to that, we have for you to display the official flag of the Military Order of the Purple Heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:09| And let me get someone to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| And I have two gentlemen here who have what's known as a very tall talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:52| Mr. Chairman, may I make just a comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Because this is to be down here with these gentlemen is really one of the honors that we have as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| And as many of you know, I served in Baghdad and Afghanistan, and I am not a hero, but I served with a lot of heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| And we had, in Afghanistan, in our tents, in our tent hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| we had a sign that was over the entrance where all the wounded soldiers came through to remind us who these people really were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:20| And the sign said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| It's not the journalist who gives us freedom of the press, but the soldiers who've made the sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| It's not the ministers who give us freedom of religion, but it's the soldiers who have made the sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| And it's not the politicians that allow us to practice democracy, but the soldiers have made the sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| My father was an infantryman in World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| He has two Purple Hearts also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| And my father is one of the people that I respect more, that I've really used as my role model on public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| And these gentlemen that I'm standing here right now, it's one of the biggest honors I've had to even be associated with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| since I've been on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| And I want to thank them again for the sacrifices they've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| It really means a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:27| So as past commander of Knoxville Chapter 356| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| and senior vice commander for the Department of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| I thank the county for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| You're welcome to attend our meetings any time you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| We meet on the third Tuesday at noon at Shoney's on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| If you come early, you get to eat before the meeting starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thanks, gentlemen, for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| You honor us with your presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Mr. Chairman, it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| And Buzz Buswell, our director of Veterans Affairs, who's also a Purple Heart recipient, can say a couple words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| He told me he didn't want to say anything, but I'm going to order him up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Buzz, give your name and address there for people on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| My name is Robert Buzz Buswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| I live at 1101 Remington in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| I want to thank the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I've been following orders my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| My dad's retired from the Air Force, and I went into the Army the day after he left the Air Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| So there's always been orders, and I always follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| I want to thank all of you for honoring the combat veterans of our community with this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| I would like to say a couple words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| I was the first state commander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| And your name, too, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| My name is Arthur Martin, and I live in Dandridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| And I was the first state commander from eastern Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Our second state commander is going to be Arthur McGinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:32| All right, Madam Clerk, we're going to go into regular session now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| Mr. Chairman, before we do that, could I have just a second, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| I personally want to thank the mayor for making this happen, honoring the veterans today, the Purple Heart winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:49| I also want to thank the mayor today for something that's been before us over the last few weeks, and that's the Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:59| The mayor helped sponsor a Saturday get-together that was called Two Wheels for Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:12| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| I got a shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| The reason that Mobile Meals has been before us is because they've been having trouble fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| and meeting the requirements of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| And through this fundraising effort, I hope they become better prepared to help those in Knox County that need assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| Also, former chair of commission, Mike Hammond, is sponsoring something tonight in relation to this Mobile Meals also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:45| And I'd like for him to give information for that because fundraising for Mobile Meals is still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| If you can help, please get a hold of those folks and help them feed our elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Tonight at the Cotton Eye Joe, we're privileged to have Cassidy Pope, who is going to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| She was the winner of The Voice last year as a member of Team Blake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| That's why I had to leave just a moment ago as she called to say she is on her way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| And so we'll be here a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| The doors will open at six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| The concert will be at eight o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| It's family friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| And it's right off of Lovell Road, but it's $5 admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| It's a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| All money is going to go to Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| That will buy three meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| And, of course, you can donate more if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| But we'd like to invite anyone who would like to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| It's going to be a good show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| This will be her first performance in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| And we're very honored that she could come and be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2858)|

| 0:48:01| We have ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Dr. Briggs is giving us our devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2882)|

| 0:48:08| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| Our Heavenly Father, as we gather today as a community and as elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| give us the wisdom to make wise decisions for our county and for our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| Help us to be better people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Help us to get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Help us to try to see both sides of issues as we deliberate on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| And on this day, we're also going to ask you to give a special blessing to our soldiers who are overseas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| to their families who are concerned about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| and especially to those that have sacrificed so much so we can practice the freedoms that we enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| In Jesus' name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Mr. Owenby is going to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| I'd like to ask that the recipients of the Purple Heart lead us in this pledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| so it would be our honor if we had them come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Hand salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2948)|

| 0:49:11| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| indivisible with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:41| Can we have a motion to approve minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2981)|

| 0:49:57| Just for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Just for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=2998)|

| 0:50:03| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| If it would be acceptable to commission, I'd like to move Item 815 up as far as we can get it toward the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:13| We have gentlemen that have come from out of town to kind of vet any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| It would be good for them to get back on the road if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Any objection to having them follow the trustees' issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| That's sort of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| It would be great if we got them before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| I don't think there's going to be one or two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Is that agreeable to the body before the trustees' issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| Will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=3045)|

| 1:10:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| And it's a 10-year deal, 10-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4249)|

| 1:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| What tweaked my curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| I'm not criticizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| I love this concept, the sales tax recapture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| You know, you point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| This $228,000 of sales tax recapture for CBID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| No, and that's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| I'm just wondering, how did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| So, I mean, it's going to probably take 10 accountants to keep up with it to see if it really happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| How did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| That number comes from, in our market studies, they have a prediction of what, say, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| the gross annual income of our particular tenants might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| And then you can break that down into the percentage that they would actually spend of their disposable income within the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:49| And that has a very particular number that you can attach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| That's using 238 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Yes, and about 300 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| 300 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| I'm not criticizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| I'm glad you pointed that out because I remember when that got down as a special act of the legislature to let the sales tax recapture happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| And that's the total sales tax recapture, not just the SCUs portion or CBIDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| That's the total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| It's still a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| $957 a unit a year and about $80 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Yeah, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Yeah, it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4342)|

| 1:13:12| I'd like to propose that we delay this for at least two weeks and call a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| For the reasons that I've considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| I think we need to, with the letter that the comptroller and the insurance company have sent the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| and with just kind of what's been going on and what's been said from those letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| I think it's important that we, as a commission, do a background check on the new trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| I think it's important that each commissioner speak with, if they have questions, of the state comptroller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| and also possibly, if necessary, talk to the bonding agent that we're discussing this with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| And I personally would like to know if, because I have two different fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| if we're doing caretaker versus other as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| So my motion is to delay for at least 14 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| and set up a special called meeting at the pleasure of the chairman and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| and to appoint a trustee at that time after we have completely vetted the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| And the way I see it happening is if a commissioner has somebody in mind that they would like to be vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| then we find a way to do a background, or they can do kind of a background check on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| and vet that through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| I just, how many, I lost track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| It's up in the 20s, I believe, of the people who are, you know, who have put in for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| Can we get, how many are there, 26?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| We've got 26 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Are we going to do background checks on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| I think, the way I see it, I mean, you know who you're, two or three people you're going to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| There's somebody that we want to consider and have a background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| It's up to the commissioner that is wanting to vote for that person or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| I mean, we sat through a three-minute interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| and we're going to give somebody a job that's probably one of the most important jobs in the county on a three-minute interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| And I think they need to be further vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| And I think this is a process to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Who's going to, who does the vetting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| I mean, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| You're in the, I'm not being critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| We could ask for them, for example, if you wanted to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| you just take Candidate A and just tell them to go down to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| and have a criminal background check done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| And correct me if I'm wrong, J.J., are you listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| And if we wanted to have a candidate, if we wanted to have a candidate have a background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| they could come down, sign a release in your office, and you would report that to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| And then also we could, I mean, I think it's imperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| You know, some of the folks are very qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| I think it's imperative that we may even check in with, just as a commissioner, kind of vet them on a personal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| And if you know somebody that works somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| and if that previous employer wants to discuss it, then talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| I think it's important that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Can we get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| I mean, that's 26 people or a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| It's not 26 people, it's four or five maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| Because you're only looking at, if everybody had one candidate, you're only looking at 11 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I think having another meeting with commissioners personally feeling better about their candidate, I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:32| Because the comptroller and the bonding insurance company has released a lot of information I think we need to take consideration of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:40| I mean, I think one of the assumptions you're making is that everybody out here already knows who they're going to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| And, you know, we don't even know who's going to be put forward to be voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| That's my only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| If you're going to put somebody forward to be voted for, I would recommend you vet them a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| Ms. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| It's true that 25 or, well, now 26, although that one was after the deadline, so I don't count it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:12| But only a dozen people showed up for the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| One of those was disqualified because he doesn't live in this county, and one was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| His father came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| So, frankly, in my opinion, if they could not get here for the interview, they're no longer considered in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| So we're not looking at 25 people to be vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| For me, it's down to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| So I agree with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| I think we need to take a little more time on this and take a little closer look at the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| Some of the candidates I feel like I know very well, and some of the candidates I don't know at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| and I don't believe that's a ---- I would like to feel like I have adequate information on all of the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| So, Brad, I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| I would even suggest that instead of 14 days that we just do it at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| I think it's also important that we have Mike Brown here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| I think this is a vote that he needs to be here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| I was just going to ask that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| If we're looking at 14 days, are all the commissioners available in 14 days for a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| or could we have it as part of the regular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| Because in Miss, is it Miss Kristen Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Isn't she there until the end of August anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| She's there until we have to do something by October 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| So she will be there until that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| That's our deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| I wanted to ask about the background checks because we've talked about criminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| but isn't this also they're wanting to know about finances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| So Mr. Caldwell, Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| If we're going to do background checks, the criminal aspect is one aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| If we're going to be looking at credit, credit history, that type thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| if you could give us some guidance as to what the bonding companies are going to be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:28| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| It is true that what the bonding company will look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| and our broker in particular will look at their financial history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| So alongside a criminal background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| it wouldn't be a bad idea of getting some sort of financial background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| Now, we can go through purchasing and figure out our best avenue to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| Because if you're going to do one, you might as well do the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Because the bond is based, supposedly based, on the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| We know what happened with our last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| It's not the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| It's the history of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| But in reality, it's the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| So it's the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| So $18.5 million is what we're looking at for the bond, right, for this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| It is an individual bond to protect Knox County in the event something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| Now, the other thing that I understood is that we're looking at policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| and procedures in that office in addition to the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| So the policies and procedures, how do we address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| There are already policies and procedures in place in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| What we are doing is our external auditors are just going to put some procedures in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| to do some additional audit work during the closeout to make sure that the things that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| during the low administration and going to the CTAS payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| that those things are checked to kind of give a double check to make the bonding company feel more relaxed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:13| about giving us a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| And it also gives our auditors, you know, some comfort as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| I think it's also important to note, we talked about this in our workshop today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| but I think the public needs to know in this bonding is that we were looking at, what, an $8,000 bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| And now because of what has gone on, we're looking at that tripling to about $24,000, $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| So, I mean, this is something that we really, really got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| So that bond is the premium is usually about $8,500 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| And now we think it's going to probably at least be $24,000 to $26,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| What did the comptroller say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I know that Mr. Anders had talked about the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| And what was the comptroller's statements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| The mayor called the comptroller last week when our bond was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| And we had a conversation with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| And the mayor informed him of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| And he told us to keep the office open and do the daily, the day-to-day activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| But as far as investing and things like that, that you would think the bond would be there for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| to try to stay away from those things and just to go about collecting property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| So, in other words, Ms. Phillips, now, this is nothing against her personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| We want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| She's, you know, she's doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| We'll do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| But in terms of her being able to invest, there are certain things that she can't do because of the bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| I mean, there's not a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| I do think that, you know, there's some discussion between what's right and what's wrong between comptroller and CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:56| But that's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| The fact of the matter is we have an investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| And I think Commissioner Shouse knows on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| He sits on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| And we have a policy that sets forth our policy for investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| It's very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| So our money is in a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| And even if things started to go south in a hurry, you can never act quick enough to get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| So it's not anything to be overly concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| So if we were to delay this for any period of time, the ability of that office to function is not in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| The office can function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| When we do have an investment policy in place, that policy would remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| In other words, she wouldn't be able to change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| It would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| But it could continue running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| I want to make sure we got that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Mr. Chairman, I'm all in favor of a delay here because I think the worst thing we could do is to feel hurried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| and rushed and make a wrong decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I want to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| And if it takes a few more days to go through this vetting process and to make sure that we've got all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| I'm all in favor of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| If the body wants to vote today, I'm prepared to vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| But I personally would like to have a few more days to ask some of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| and to properly vet some of these things so that I know that when I vote, I'm making the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Commissioner Hammond touched on most of what my questions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| Two things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| The first one, Commissioner Burroughs talked of 25 names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| Now, one thing that I just do think the number is 26, that that last person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| they actually complied with the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| They made a request, how do I apply, and they were given send an e-mail to the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| and that was done before that 12 noon deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| So I think we need to consider all 26 names here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| You know, everyone can have their own reasons for cutting names in or out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| whether they showed up or not, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| But I do think all 26 names need to appear before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| And my second kind of follow-up to Commissioner Hammond is just a general question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| Is there anything that, during that discussion with he and Ms. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| is there anything from a legal standpoint as far as the bonding that we need to understand going into this potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| delay or potential vote as it relates to the bonding issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| I think Mr. Caldwell covered it pretty succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| The only disparity between the comptroller's office and the CTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| or even our law department's position statutorily is whether they can invest or not invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| And the comptroller felt more comfortable not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| The statute is silent on bonding for a chief deputy in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| So legally they can act on behalf of the county to the fullest by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5156)|
| 1:26:04| What we were going after the bond for is we felt that it would be more protective anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| And Ms. Phillips qualified for the bond, and then we had these other issues come up that wouldn't be related to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| So I think everything is before the commission, both legally and from, you know, policy standpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| I think you have the information, is what I would tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| And I don't know if this is for you or Ms. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| If, you know, if we do our due diligence, we go out there and we get these reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| are we comfortable that that successful candidate, he or she will get a reasonable bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:43| and that that bond won't always be, you know, three times that we will restore whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:50| I hate to say trust, but whatever misgivings that our rating agencies have, is this a blip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:59| or is this a shift in terms of folks thinking of Knox County in our statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:07| I've learned that once price goes up, it's always hard to get it to go back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| But having said that, we will work with our broker over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| Oh, after year one to try to get that price down on that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| We know that our broker has basically told us, which I said today and I'll say again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| is that they have reasonably assured us that if a respectable person is chosen that we could get the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:42| We didn't know it was going to cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| And then after year one, when the election happens next August and whatever happens then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| then we would apply for a new surety bond and would attempt to get a lower price based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| hopefully, the history of the office, you know, we prove that it's a blimp and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| You know, I'm not concerned about $8,000 to $24,000, but if it affects our ratings, that's really, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| hopefully this doesn't have any long-term kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| I can tell you that during our ratings calls with our agencies this week and that was not even broached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:22| so I think we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| I kind of echo the words of Commissioner Hammond that I'm ready to vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| I do want to ensure that we select someone who would possess the qualities necessary to fulfill the duties of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:51| I do not know that there are or there are not people on the list of 26 that maybe shouldn't be on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5331)|
| 1:29:05| It's sort of the way I look at it is if we go to the election next year, we do not do a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:13| The people that go to the ballot box do the background check, and they don't do it like we're discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:23| In fact, that brings to mind the resolution that we've just passed just in the last few minutes, that being 818,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:33| and whenever I read a couple of paragraphs, we're already talking about things that are not included in that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:41| being that there is a deadline passed that no one can submit another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| Paragraph 1 and 2 of that resolution, both in black print there, I believe I read that, as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:55| I can bring you the name of and nominate a person today in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| and that person not necessarily even have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| All there has to be is a note that I possess saying that if they are appointed, they'll accept the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:12| So I'm now going from one extreme to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| When denominations close, they close whenever we've polled the 11 members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:30| And who can be elected as we've got in our Resolution 818?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| Anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| We can appoint anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| That's the one extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| The other extreme is we can put it off for two weeks or we can put it off for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Thank you, Mr. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722Pt1?start=5449)|
