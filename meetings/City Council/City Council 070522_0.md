| 0:03:47| there may be something that I might ask the council to do in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| I may ask them to see if they'll have a special meeting in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| but you need to get on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=236)|

| 0:06:53| I believe you might quit working there, but I understand what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| What happened is my wife and I owned an establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| And after her owning a previous business of hers, she was caught selling to a miner as a cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| And under those circumstances, the way I understood it, once something like that has happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| you can't work in an establishment, run an establishment, as far as I know, in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| So what has happened is now that she can't even work there, she has taken another job with a nursing staffing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| And now it's all in my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| And, fortunately, we still have the lady that you know, Melissa, working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| And that's where we're at with it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| I do know Melissa, as it happens, in not a very personal way, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| And I know that she very much needs to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| I'm very aware of her circumstances and with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| And I think she'll make you a great employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| It's difficult since the task program certification has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| That's something that is just crucial to your operation without other incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| And I know that we have at least a couple of people on council who do not like to issue a permit until that has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| I will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| So let me ask you, now you are operating but not selling any beer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| We sure aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| There was a waiting list now on Thursdays, if I'm not mistaken, is when they hold the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| Officer Pesky, do you want to comment on when that's available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| It's on Thursday, sir, at 10 o'clock at the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| We could still do it pending or something or so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Well, I think Ms. Roddy has her light on, and I have a feeling what her sentiments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| But I'll let her speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Would you prefer to make a motion, Ms. Pila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| This is certainly in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Well, I was going to make a motion that under the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| since we've had a couple of delays actually with getting this situation straightened out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| we could make a motion to approve pending final documentation, which is the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| And I just really want to impress on you how important that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| because I think that will give you some very good information about how you want to organize your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| We have taken further steps in this store other than our old store where we had an old-style cash register system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| Now we've invested in a ruby system such as having to put dates, birthday dates, as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| In that situation, it won't approve a sale if you push the correct date in and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| We have taken steps to prevent anything like this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| And we're not a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| We are a convenience store with a sitting area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| It's a country setting where we serve country food, mashed potatoes, green beans, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| We're not a bar by no means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| And by each and every one of you that are coming to eat with us, we need your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| I'm familiar with your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Well, I did make the motion that we approve the permit pending on final documentation, which is the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Councilman Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Councilwoman Pilo, with greatest apologies to you and the applicant, I cannot support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| There is a history of violations associated with this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| I just really take a strong stand on sale to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| And that is what the task program certification addresses is proper carding of individuals when they come in, proper ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| So I cannot support this application until that training is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| That's just critical for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Would I be able to do this this Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Or is there still a big, long waiting list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| There's not a waiting list, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| It's a first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| You can come and sign in at 7 o'clock if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Councilman Boehner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I'm going to support it because he's going to have to take the task training before he gets the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| So that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| And I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=670)|

| 0:18:38| Jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| I think they're because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| they're changing their permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| from on premise to only an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| I just want to be sure what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| We need a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| It's still before you right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1129)|

| 0:18:54| floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| I would ask that it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| But you all need to move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| amend it in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Make a motion that we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1140)|

| 0:19:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| And we're back on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| We didn't even have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I didn't have a motion so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| was going to wait for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| question before I put a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| to answer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I think I know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1167)|
| 0:19:35| The question probably had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| do with the closeness of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| church when it was an on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1178)|

| 0:19:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| That would be my assumption as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| And if it's an off premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| the requirements change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| An off premise, I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| The distance doesn't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| be as great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1190)|

| 0:22:08| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| I saw Allison Ebertine come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Is she here from the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1332)|

| 0:22:15| She's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1336)|

| 0:22:24| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| I move we approve pending final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Now, part of the agreement was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| that there will be no ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| interest with the former owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| of Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Is the law department satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| that that's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Ms. Smith has provided us her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| She's provided the list of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| shareholders and she's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| provided us with assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| that in the lease agreement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| there's no evidence from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| documentation that the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| owners have anything to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| the operation of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| They're just leasing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| I was trying to remember the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| situation we had with Red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Iguana as it transformed into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| or went from Banana Joe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| excuse me, to the Red Iguana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Are they allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| ownership interest in the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| The agreed order did allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| to retain the property as owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| of the property, but that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| the sole role that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| have in the business is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| ownership of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| I just wanted to comment that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| of course, this is a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| that's of interest and concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| to all of us because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| And at some point, maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| couple of months ago, Ms. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| contacted me and we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| We had met prior because at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| point in time she worked with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| establishment when I was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| record commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| She was the spokesperson for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| of the record companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| So I had recalled her from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| But this was a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I was not aware of her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| relationship, that there was any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| relationship with Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| And, of course, she stated to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| her position that she had held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| And her interest in seeing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| property once again reach a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| reputable establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| So we've talked quite at length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| And then I spoke with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| counsel, Mr. Swanson, and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| with Allison in regard to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| this might in any way be related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| to the earlier litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| And they consequently, Ms. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| was very willing to provide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| documentation that Ms. Eberting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| commented on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| And that has been reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| And to my knowledge, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| looks to be quite in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| And I think Ms. Smith is quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| aware that we are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| about the relationship there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| But, of course, the property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| owned, and legally so, by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| party that had been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| with Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| And it is not her intention, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| tells me, and perhaps she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| like to make those statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| I think that would be a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| helpful thing for you to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| record about your plans there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| and just what you expect your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| relationship to be with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Jorgensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I have been inspected by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| health department, so that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| been turned in also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| All my paperwork should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| I know it says something about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| rabies on it, but that's all he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And I turned it in to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| The second thing is, he is my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| He is only my landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I wasn't the only one that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| I wasn't the only one that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| I just happened to be the one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| obtain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Yes, Mr. Chairman, let me ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| you, are you going to be hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| or using the same chef that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| had before, Stoney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Do you know him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Chris Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| At this point, no, I do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| any intention of hiring him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| If you were, I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| he's a good chef, but he's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| my cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| I was going to disclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| I voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| But if you're not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| hiring him, I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| If you were hiring him, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| disclosed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| I think it would be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| helpful, Alisa, if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| want to comment on your plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| for training your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| We have already started that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| initial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| The people who have come on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| already, Annie Williams, who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| going to be my general manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| has attended the task class with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Lieutenant Bob Wooldridge at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Anyone who is hired, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| they are already ABC certified or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| not, will be required to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| through that class again and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| recertified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| That is one of the discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| And I didn't ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Actually, Ms. Smith volunteered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| that she felt that that was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| important under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| And I do, too, because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| some of the same clientele are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| going to be visiting your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| I just think they will when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| reopens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| So I think it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| for your staff to be fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| trained and fully aware of KPD's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| regulations and the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| And the gentleman who is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| to head up my security is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| gentleman who is a former DUI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| task force officer from Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| I was hoping you would comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Councilman Hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Ms. Smith, you had stated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Ms. Epertini, I guess, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| went on record as saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| none of the former owners of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Michael's will have any, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| obviously own the underlying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| real estate, but they have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| equity position in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Do they have any, do they own or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| control any debt instruments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Do you, will you be borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| any money for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Will they have any debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| position in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Absolutely not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| This is a sole venture on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| And they're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Signing for any credit or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Is this a different concept or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| is it a similar concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| It's similar, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| We are emphasizing on the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| primarily, where we will have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| food special every night of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| That's the real difference right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| You know, we are going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| two-step process as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| making sure that underage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| do not come through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Although we will have a doorman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| there from the time we open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| until the time we close, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| will stay, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| We are going to close at 2 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| We are not staying open until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Do I understand you to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| there wouldn't be anyone under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| 21 allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| And when I say that, I do say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| that during Christmas banquet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| season, our dining room is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| completely closed off with two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| And if someone underage did want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| to come back there for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Christmas banquet with a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| we would allow them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| But once that party was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| complete, they would be escorted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| out the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| And we have enough security to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| make that a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1791)|

| 0:29:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1799)|
| 0:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1813)|

| 0:30:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1820)|
| 0:30:33| We will go next to steward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Peek Lane, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| No applicable record on all the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| The manager has not been in for process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| We're looking for a certificate of zoning, fire inspector approval, and a final business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| tax return under the former ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Councilman Pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Move approval, pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I think we have to put this one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| I think anybody who's come in and not been in for processing, this is not an automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| – I mean, everything else that's on that list is merely a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| This is real information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| I'm not going to vote for anything that has not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I'm sorry, I did not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Oh, you missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| The manager had not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I did not hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| I think I was distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Are you the manager, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| No, I'm the director of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| The manager has been our manager in Knoxville for going on eight, nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| He was on Beaumont and Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| We sold that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| He's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| I'm sure that he's been through the TAM class and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| It's our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| All we did was buy out the interest of Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| All we did was make sure that we applied to make sure that everything read right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| We are the previous owners and the current owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Is Mr. Palmer the current manager right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| At this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| This location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| And he was the manager before we made this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| In a situation like this, Mr. Swanson, they're still required to come in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| That's my understanding of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Is Councilman Becker finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Well, I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| I was going to go to a different subject, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| I guess I was just going to say with greatest apologies to everybody involved in this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| we've deferred many applicants in the past because someone in the ownership of the management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| has not been in for processing, and I understand this manager has worked for this company for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| a long time and is currently the manager, but part of reapplying when there's a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| in ownership is checking all those boxes and the manager needs to come back in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| So I can't support Mrs. Pilo's motion if it is still on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Based on what Mr. Swanson just said, it's their specialty to come back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| I withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| And I would withdraw my motion with the same apologies, but I was not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| I was aware of the ownership situation, so I guess I did not understand the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| Councilman Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| No, and I understand it, and it's really, he'd been processed before, so I didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| he had to come in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| So we'll make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| So you all bought out in off the college's interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| He's been always the operating partner in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| Will you all continue to use Knoxville College students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Councilman Hochulst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2045)|
| 0:34:14| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Yeah, is there, are you all in a point where you can actually delay the official transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| and keep operating, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Well, I'm just going to tell you, I mean, we transferred the ownership and paid off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Knoxville College probably maybe even almost a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| They were under some financial duress, and we just bought out the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| I hope the tape wasn't working then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| And you've been selling beer since that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Well, that's where I was going with it, is the, what's the status of the current permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| Because I was thinking if you had a current permit, you could just continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| on the active permit you have until you get your, but you don't even have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| I think they had one until just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| Ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Yeah, about ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Yeah, this is a joke, just to be clear, because sometimes my jokes miss people, unlike Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Frost's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| If all the owners were to get arrested, would Mark be the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| About seven days, I guess, or ten days until the council convened and elected you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| Can we get a second for Councilman Hope, what's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Let me just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| The vote is cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Do you understand that you're not supposed to be selling beer right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Well, I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I was contacted at 5.30 and said to have a beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I should be down here at 6 o'clock, so I'll answer anything you want me to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2159)|
| 0:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Just as a process question, in a situation where an ownership transfer happens, how do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| we find out that that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I mean, is this one where we actually have to wait for somebody to come in and apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| for a new permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Well, I don't foresee the future, and I don't often know what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| The answer would be until someone tells us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| And you're only doing it, even in whatever, you don't know, you're not checking who the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| owner is on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| You've got, yeah, on a sting or something, you're, yeah, that's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| Yours is enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Yours is not enforcement of the underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| Yours is not enforcement of the actual administrative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2223)|
| 0:37:19| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| So beer cannot be legally sold at this location until we have an active permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| That was a question I just asked Mr. Swanson, so why don't you ask him that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| You cannot sell beer unless you have a valid permit in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| Now, I'm not sure that he understands necessarily exactly when ownership necessarily transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2263)|
| 0:37:52| and all those kinds of issues that may be involved in this, and he might do well to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| seek legal advice with respect to those issues and might do well to bring a lawyer with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| when he comes on these kinds of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| But based on what he said so far and based on his own statement before the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| it sounds like they've been selling beer without a permit for about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| And we're deferring this permit from four weeks to the next registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| That's what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| All in favor of the deferral for four weeks, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| You've been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I would just like to also say for the record, if there is consideration given, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| really for you, that we try to hear this maybe before the next council meeting, which sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| happens in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| I'd ask for the same consideration for the earlier entity that was in my district that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| just had to come in for her testing, if she's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| And that may be something we want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| We've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| But if we do, we need to consider it for the other one we turned down for not being for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| processing also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Ruby Tuesdays, number 5117.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| And that's my district also, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Chair, they've requested a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| For how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Until the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Until the June Fair Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Who is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Is this Salserita's or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2386)|

| 0:40:45| We have a thing to defer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Mr. Chairman, there's a letter in here that Taco Del Mar would like to be postponed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| the regular scheduled June beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2447)|

| 0:44:56| We got our building permit once we started our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| We hit some snags inside the property, and we had to alter our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| So we had to deal with another architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| And then the shopping center that we're in, the fire marshal wanted us to bring a few things up to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| and it's part of the shopping center's issue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| Also, plumbing issue, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| They need to bring it up to code so we can bring our part up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| Other than that, that's all I'm asking for is an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Do you have any idea of how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| We finally got health department approved our plan for what we have to do now on the 11th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2739)|
| 0:45:49| I went and met with the gentleman up there, and he approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| So we should be back on schedule probably by the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| That's what we're expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Try and be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| I was just going to ask, do you think another 30 days or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| I would ask for 60, just for a buffer, just in case something was to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| I'll move to extend for an additional 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Now, your 60 days or two were the July beer award meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| Well, because it was approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| He just needs to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| It won't have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Yeah, I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| And last but not least, I just wanted to remind you of the memo I sent regarding beer permittees that haven't paid their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2800)|
| 0:46:49| And really all I want to say tonight is to see if there's something else you need us to do before you can make a decision on what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2809)|
| 0:47:03| Ms. Martin, what are our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Can the permit be ---- sorry, you're on my line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Are the permits typically suspended for nonpayment of licensing fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| Or does this come out annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| I'm sorry that I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| I remember the memo that you sent and the long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Well, there's two things at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Their gross receipts tax aren't paid, which means they don't have current business licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| That puts them in violation of the code for the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| And some of them haven't paid their annual privilege tax of $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| So there are two related issues involved, but not for all of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| And I would ---- we haven't typically done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| So I would defer to the attorney for advice on how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| I would suggest to you that the appropriate action to take is for someone to make a motion to refer those issues to the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| to investigate whether a suspension or revocation hearing should be initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| And if it should, go ahead and take appropriate action to initiate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| Typically what happens when that process gets initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| the folks who need to do what they need to do get it done and it gets itself resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| That's typically what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Counselor Hulkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| So that motion in its content says that this will go on to suspension and revocation if it's not resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2905)|
| 0:48:35| In other words, we've acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| The law department will investigate whether or not to initiate that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| and if they feel it appropriate to do so, to initiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| So it will really be it's you sending it to the law department to do what they think is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| and then typically the law department sends out their notice saying we're getting ready to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| and then a whole bunch of people pay their money, and it gets handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| But it doesn't have to come back to this body to go to suspension and revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| You have given them the discretion to go ahead and start if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| We have a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| It's been adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070522?start=2964)|
