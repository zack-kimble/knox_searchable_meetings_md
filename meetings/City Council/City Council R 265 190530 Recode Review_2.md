| 4:51:19| and we appreciate the opportunity to share our opinions with council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17479)|
| 4:51:23| and we've done that all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17483)|
| 4:51:26| You do not need to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17486)|
| 4:51:28| I appreciate the amount of work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17488)|
| 4:51:31| We don't mean to dominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17491)|
| 4:51:32| We're just trying to make this a better product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17492)|
| 4:51:35| And it's not that you guys have caused anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17495)|
| 4:51:39| This is the way things are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17499)|
| 4:51:41| These are how decisions are made in these rooms where it doesn't include everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17501)|
| 4:51:47| and we make decisions for other people whose lives we don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17507)|
| 4:51:51| I understand exactly what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17511)|
| 4:51:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17513)|
| 4:51:54| I would just like to add here that, remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17514)|
| 4:51:57| this is towards the end of what's been a really long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17517)|
| 4:52:00| where there has been an attempt to reach out to many parts of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17520)|
| 4:52:04| all parts of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17524)|
| 4:52:06| and ultimately it comes down to you all as the representatives of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17526)|
| 4:52:13| both your district and others in the community, really all of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17533)|
| 4:52:18| that you all know and that you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17538)|
| 4:52:22| And you all have already, many issues have been raised about people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17542)|
| 4:52:25| like our issues about the drug treatments in halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17545)|
| 4:52:28| Those issues have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17548)|
| 4:52:30| It is doubtful that individuals in that situation will be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17550)|
| 4:52:33| and have the time and the energy and the broadband at this point in their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17553)|
| 4:52:40| to be here and to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17560)|
| 4:52:42| But we saw right here where they were represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17562)|
| 4:52:45| which I think was a wonderful discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17565)|
| 4:52:47| It was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17567)|
| 4:52:48| So, I mean, I appreciate, as I know you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17568)|
| 4:52:51| the people who are in it at 830, you know, five and a half hours later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17571)|
| 4:52:55| if I did my math right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17575)|
| 4:52:57| But we do have to remember those who aren't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17577)|
| 4:53:00| and I think all of us come with that approach to know that that's why we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17580)|
| 4:53:06| that's why we've moved to this level of discussion now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17586)|
| 4:53:09| because we do represent and think about many different people who aren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17589)|
| 4:53:17| And so that is our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17597)|
| 4:53:20| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17600)|
| 4:53:21| And, you know, the folks that are here are representing different parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17601)|
| 4:53:26| Not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17606)|
| 4:53:27| It's not their fault, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17607)|
| 4:53:29| But they are helping us dig into the details and challenge us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17609)|
| 4:53:34| and I think that's part of the process where you are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17614)|
| 4:53:36| But we do need to remember who is not in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17616)|
| 4:53:40| and that is, at this point, council's responsibility to raise those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17620)|
| 4:53:45| if they're not raised in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17625)|
| 4:53:47| But, I mean, I understand your frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17627)|
| 4:53:49| and I agree with the points that you made as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17629)|
| 4:53:52| Let me end with thanking you guys for how much work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17632)|
| 4:53:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17635)|
| 4:53:56| We're just trying to make this a better document for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17636)|
| 4:54:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17641)|
| 4:54:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17643)|
| 4:54:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17644)|
| 4:54:05| Who wants to speak next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17645)|
| 4:54:06| Are we still on 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17646)|
| 4:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17647)|
| 4:54:08| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17648)|
| 4:54:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17650)|
| 4:54:12| I know when Gerald was going through the list of changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17652)|
| 4:54:16| he went on page 10.4, 10.3, number 7 had been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17656)|
| 4:54:24| I think the problem with just completely removing this is that you basically create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17664)|
| 4:54:30| an accessory dwelling unit without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17670)|
| 4:54:32| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17672)|
| 4:54:33| I've lost the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17673)|
| 4:54:34| It's on page 10.4, section 10.3, accessory structure and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17674)|
| 4:54:40| 7, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17680)|
| 4:54:41| Number 7, which has been completely crossed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17681)|
| 4:54:43| So I understood the debate that you all were having with why you removed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17683)|
| 4:54:50| The problem with removing it completely is that you basically set a scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17690)|
| 4:54:54| where you can have an accessory dwelling unit without following the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17694)|
| 4:54:58| for the accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17698)|
| 4:55:00| So I know Peter and I had talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17700)|
| 4:55:04| but what I would suggest is where number 7 is crossed out now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17704)|
| 4:55:10| add in that no accessory structure may contain both a permanent cooking facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17710)|
| 4:55:17| and plumbing unless the structure also complies with section 10.3B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17717)|
| 4:55:23| which is the accessory dwelling unit section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17723)|
| 4:55:27| Is that still something you're okay with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17727)|
| 4:55:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17729)|
| 4:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17730)|
| 4:55:31| The reason to do that is otherwise you've got to work around where you can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17731)|
| 4:55:34| have an ADU and never go through the next section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17734)|
| 4:55:38| which will be my second part that I'll talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17738)|
| 4:55:42| Okay, so that is a motion you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17742)|
| 4:55:44| That's a motion to change number 7 to no accessory structure may contain both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17744)|
| 4:55:50| a permanent cooking facility and plumbing unless the structure also complies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17750)|
| 4:55:57| with section 10.3B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17757)|
| 4:56:00| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17760)|
| 4:56:01| Is your intent to allow them to have one or the other or not allow either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17761)|
| 4:56:07| It's a continuity kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17767)|
| 4:56:10| And if they have both, then they have to comply with the ADU section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17770)|
| 4:56:15| Okay, so is that written correctly up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17775)|
| 4:56:17| What are the other terms of your ADU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17777)|
| 4:56:22| What are you proposing on B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17782)|
| 4:56:24| Well, in the next section in B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17784)|
| 4:56:27| In B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17787)|
| 4:56:28| Which is at the bottom of page 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17788)|
| 4:56:30| Is it 10-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17790)|
| 4:56:31| I mean, do you want to go through one thing at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17791)|
| 4:56:33| or do you want to do them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17793)|
| 4:56:35| Well, I don't want to agree to changing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17795)|
| 4:56:37| until I know what the other changes that are going to be below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17797)|
| 4:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17800)|
| 4:56:41| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17801)|
| 4:56:42| Okay, so we'll allow that to sit here while we talk about the other one for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17802)|
| 4:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17807)|
| 4:56:48| Well, in section 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17808)|
| 4:56:50| As the law director said, I can't, but I'm going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17810)|
| 4:56:53| Overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17813)|
| 4:56:54| I'm going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17814)|
| 4:56:55| Let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17815)|
| 4:56:56| Let's get the whole picture out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17816)|
| 4:57:00| So in 10-4, what I was going to suggest doing in part B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17820)|
| 4:57:05| the accessory dwelling unit, is, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17825)|
| 4:57:09| this has been an area where we've seen a lot of debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17829)|
| 4:57:13| and certainly when I had the second district all-neighborhood meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17833)|
| 4:57:17| this was a big topic that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17837)|
| 4:57:20| And I know many of you have heard about this area, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17840)|
| 4:57:25| So there's two things I was looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17845)|
| 4:57:29| One was that we make the accessory dwelling unit a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17849)|
| 4:57:35| and the second one was that we create an option in the established neighborhood section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17855)|
| 4:57:42| which would be back in Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17862)|
| 4:57:45| where a neighborhood who designates themselves as an established neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17865)|
| 4:57:50| would have the option of choosing in that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17870)|
| 4:57:53| whether they have accessory dwelling units or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17873)|
| 4:57:56| There's many neighborhoods, not just in the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17876)|
| 4:57:59| who want to have options about what they would allow in their neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17879)|
| 4:58:06| with regard to accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17886)|
| 4:58:09| And I think that having this as an option would give the neighborhood the choice to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17889)|
| 4:58:17| what was best for the infrastructure in their own neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17897)|
| 4:58:21| I know this is one, as well, that I've spoken with Gerald about at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17901)|
| 4:58:26| and I think he's still okay with making that EN change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17906)|
| 4:58:31| We would need to create two established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17911)|
| 4:58:36| The current one is for 22,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17916)|
| 4:58:40| I would make an EN1 with 10,000 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17920)|
| 4:58:44| because right now I have requests from West Hills, Forest Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17924)|
| 4:58:50| and Sequoia, and I'm going to imagine that we probably have requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17930)|
| 4:58:55| from outside of the second district, as well, if we were able to put this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17935)|
| 4:59:01| The one thing I may add, and we have discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17941)|
| 4:59:07| but keep that additional EN neighborhood until we look at additional EN neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17947)|
| 4:59:14| and make sure that whatever we come up with for the additional EN neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17954)|
| 4:59:18| fits that or those neighborhoods rather than trying to create a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17958)|
| 4:59:23| to fit something we don't know the size of into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17963)|
| 4:59:26| Let's wait until we know the size of it and then create the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17966)|
| 4:59:30| So basically, I think the next step here would be that I would open it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17970)|
| 4:59:36| for all council members to go back and talk to your neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17976)|
| 4:59:39| and then get with Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17979)|
| 4:59:41| I've already told him about the neighborhoods that have requested it from the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17981)|
| 4:59:46| And then we can just do one resolution that says these are the neighborhoods that would like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17986)|
| 4:59:52| The process that I've gone over with Gerald is that basically the neighborhood set up a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17992)|
| 4:59:59| and the committee would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=17999)|
| 5:00:00| The first is that we put it on our work program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18000)|
| 5:00:03| and then assign a priority based on the numerous other things we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18003)|
| 5:00:07| So given the number of them that you say are interested, I see two, three years of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18007)|
| 5:00:15| And I think just think of the NSCIP down zoning, the Oakwood-Lincoln Park historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18015)|
| 5:00:25| We've been working on the historic overlay for Oakwood-Lincoln Park for about a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18025)|
| 5:00:30| These are not, you know, especially given the back load of work that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18030)|
| 5:00:36| So it's an option, and we'll get to it as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18036)|
| 5:00:41| And I may be overly pessimistic in the amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18041)|
| 5:00:44| We may be able to do it very quickly, but I'd have to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18044)|
| 5:00:46| and look at our work program and assign priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18046)|
| 5:00:49| Yeah, and I think that's the – I mean, we have tried as council to always remember as we add things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18049)|
| 5:00:54| that there are – not that we shouldn't add them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18054)|
| 5:00:57| but that we have to be aware of everything that's on the list and know what the priority is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18057)|
| 5:01:00| We just have to be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18060)|
| 5:01:02| But certainly that can be added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18062)|
| 5:01:05| Yes, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18065)|
| 5:01:07| And it's something, as I told Councilmember Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18067)|
| 5:01:14| my first meeting with the West Hills neighborhood about four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18074)|
| 5:01:18| I recommended that they seek EN designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18078)|
| 5:01:24| The second meeting with them about two years ago, I made the same recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18084)|
| 5:01:28| but I'm glad he's more convincing than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18088)|
| 5:01:33| You have to work on that charm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18093)|
| 5:01:35| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18095)|
| 5:01:36| So, okay, so this is something that you're requesting that following – after RECO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18096)|
| 5:01:41| and it's not happening now, but they get this into the work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18101)|
| 5:01:44| So what is the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18104)|
| 5:01:47| The wording that I have for page 10.4, section B, subsection 2, would read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18107)|
| 5:01:59| an ADU may be located only on a lot with a single-family dwelling in RN1 and RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18119)|
| 5:02:09| with special use approval and shall be permitted in EN only if the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18129)|
| 5:02:15| RECO designates in a new EN application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18135)|
| 5:02:19| one of the dwelling units must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18139)|
| 5:02:27| So only in RN1 and RN2 with – what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18147)|
| 5:02:33| With special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18153)|
| 5:02:34| With special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18154)|
| 5:02:41| Okay, discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18161)|
| 5:02:43| Please sing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18163)|
| 5:02:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18165)|
| 5:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18166)|
| 5:02:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18167)|
| 5:02:50| Okay, ma'am, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18170)|
| 5:02:51| Yes, I just have a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18171)|
| 5:02:54| My income is a little more than half of $25,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18174)|
| 5:02:59| so I feel like I come from the group that represents probably the majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18179)|
| 5:03:04| Knoxville residents and sadly not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18184)|
| 5:03:09| They are the ones, since they are the majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18189)|
| 5:03:11| and many are unable or unwilling to come and try to speak up for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18191)|
| 5:03:15| because, I don't know, they feel out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18195)|
| 5:03:18| They don't feel like their voice counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18198)|
| 5:03:20| But I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18200)|
| 5:03:24| And I just wanted to say that perhaps a way to address this is that even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18204)|
| 5:03:29| there are very valid concerns that Ms. Malone has brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18209)|
| 5:03:33| she has tended to abuse the five-minute time limit for speaking per article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18213)|
| 5:03:40| You know, when she gets to the third one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18220)|
| 5:03:44| when counsel is going over Article 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18224)|
| 5:03:47| and she's speaking for the third time on different subjects in Article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18227)|
| 5:03:51| that might be giving her a little too much time in the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18231)|
| 5:03:55| since there is a five-minute time limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18235)|
| 5:03:58| Okay, we have kind of tried to be lax on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18238)|
| 5:04:01| because I feel like we're still moving along pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18241)|
| 5:04:04| These are a lot of important discussions, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18244)|
| 5:04:08| But we are kind of looking at it at make your point as succinctly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18248)|
| 5:04:16| You can make multiple points on multiple sections of each article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18256)|
| 5:04:20| because people really have put a lot of time and effort into the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18260)|
| 5:04:24| So we're handling a little differently here than a regular council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18264)|
| 5:04:29| and it's for that reason to try and really engage as many people on as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18269)|
| 5:04:34| but as succinctly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18274)|
| 5:04:37| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18277)|
| 5:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18278)|
| 5:04:39| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18279)|
| 5:04:41| Okay, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18281)|
| 5:04:42| While I support accessory dwelling units as a permitted use in all residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18282)|
| 5:04:49| it's something that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18289)|
| 5:04:53| I think it's a property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18293)|
| 5:04:56| I support it limiting it to certain neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18296)|
| 5:05:00| I think that would really be unfair that a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18300)|
| 5:05:03| even a well-organized neighborhood group doesn't speak for the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18303)|
| 5:05:08| They're speaking for the few that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18308)|
| 5:05:10| There's plenty of people in those neighborhoods that he mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18310)|
| 5:05:13| that have accessory dwelling units, that have built them recently and have used them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18313)|
| 5:05:19| So they're scattered all throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18319)|
| 5:05:22| I think they're expensive to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18322)|
| 5:05:25| It's not going to be a rush to build them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18325)|
| 5:05:28| They're not cheap, and rising building costs are not getting cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18328)|
| 5:05:33| I think it's permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18333)|
| 5:05:36| I think it can't be decided by neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18336)|
| 5:05:39| There's no way to get a vote of every single person in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18339)|
| 5:05:43| And I would come close to supporting the first piece of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18343)|
| 5:05:50| allowing accessory, you know, that they have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18350)|
| 5:05:53| if they're going to have both plumbing and cooking facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18353)|
| 5:05:59| then you'd have to comply with all the other regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18359)|
| 5:06:03| But to put that burden on the planning commission to go back and study all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18363)|
| 5:06:07| I mean, there's how many homes in Sequoia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18367)|
| 5:06:12| 4,000? 3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18372)|
| 5:06:14| So that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18374)|
| 5:06:16| So to go back and to study all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18376)|
| 5:06:17| there's no way to get everybody to come to a consensus vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18377)|
| 5:06:21| So I think that's unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18381)|
| 5:06:23| I think I support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18383)|
| 5:06:24| I think they're very valuable to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18384)|
| 5:06:26| and the components of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18386)|
| 5:06:28| and I don't think they provide any real threat to property values at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18388)|
| 5:06:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18392)|
| 5:06:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18394)|
| 5:06:35| Name and address again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18395)|
| 5:06:37| Michael Simpson, 1401 Cuesta Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18397)|
| 5:06:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18400)|
| 5:06:41| You mentioned the ADUs, and thank you for mentioning that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18401)|
| 5:06:44| It totally slipped my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18404)|
| 5:06:46| Where I live at in Holston Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18406)|
| 5:06:49| there are several people that like to come out from outside of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18409)|
| 5:06:53| and buy our properties to flip them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18413)|
| 5:06:56| There's a lot of aged people that are in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18416)|
| 5:06:58| A lot of those people, you'll find the house is dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18418)|
| 5:07:02| As a matter of fact, the house right across from where I live right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18422)|
| 5:07:05| it was bought by flippers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18425)|
| 5:07:07| and what they're selling it for is, I think it's extremely high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18427)|
| 5:07:12| But if you are coming in from outside of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18432)|
| 5:07:15| and you buy a house as a flip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18435)|
| 5:07:18| well, you're going to do whatever you can to get the most money for your investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18438)|
| 5:07:25| So does that actually open the doorway for these people to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18445)|
| 5:07:29| that are not part of the community to build an ADU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18449)|
| 5:07:33| Because they're not living in it, they're not having anything to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18453)|
| 5:07:36| but that's what they're marketing it as now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18456)|
| 5:07:39| So they're going to raise the value of that property because it does have that ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18459)|
| 5:07:45| Whereas if it was coming organically from within the community, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18465)|
| 5:07:49| That is the property owner's decision if the property owner lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18469)|
| 5:07:54| So if you are an investor, I don't want you coming into my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18474)|
| 5:07:59| and building up ADUs when you're not even going to have anything to do with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18479)|
| 5:08:06| So is this going to permit that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18486)|
| 5:08:08| if you're coming in from outside the community and flipping properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18488)|
| 5:08:14| Are you asking me a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18494)|
| 5:08:15| Yes, for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18495)|
| 5:08:16| I don't think you can control who comes in and buys property in your subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18496)|
| 5:08:20| I mean, that's not something we can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18500)|
| 5:08:23| And pushing the property values higher would only benefit those people that are selling afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18503)|
| 5:08:29| It's not a detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18509)|
| 5:08:31| So I don't see that as being harmful to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18511)|
| 5:08:36| If you sell the property at a higher price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18516)|
| 5:08:38| that means the properties surrounding that property are actually going to go up in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18518)|
| 5:08:42| So now you are hyper-exaggerating the value of properties as well as what happens in the effect of your property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18522)|
| 5:08:52| Your house is now worth more, so now you're going to have to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18532)|
| 5:08:55| When that was nothing to do with my decision, and we didn't want it there in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18535)|
| 5:09:01| So as far as I'm concerned, the city is not entitled to any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18541)|
| 5:09:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18545)|
| 5:09:06| The city is not entitled to any additional money for my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18546)|
| 5:09:10| because someone else actually made the value of it go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18550)|
| 5:09:13| And unfortunately, with the zoning, we can't prevent a property owner from improving their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18553)|
| 5:09:20| And that does often have ripple effects that increases the value of others' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18560)|
| 5:09:25| Well, I think it would be overstretched to expect the city to tell every property owner in the city that they can't improve their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18565)|
| 5:09:35| Well, I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18575)|
| 5:09:37| Hey, sir, I don't want to just keep going back and forth on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18577)|
| 5:09:40| so why don't you just make your final statement so we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18580)|
| 5:09:44| Yes, ma'am, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18584)|
| 5:09:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18585)|
| 5:09:46| Because when it comes to you, oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18586)|
| 5:09:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18588)|
| 5:09:49| I do want to bring to your attention, and you have some very good points that you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18589)|
| 5:09:52| but an ADU may be located only on a lot with one single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18592)|
| 5:09:56| One of the dwelling units must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18596)|
| 5:10:02| So that within itself should give you some comfort in knowing that you're not going to have a developer come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18602)|
| 5:10:11| and just buy up a couple of properties and then build ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18611)|
| 5:10:14| and they are not a resident on at least one of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18614)|
| 5:10:17| And so we do have that protection here as it relates to ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18617)|
| 5:10:21| So I did want to bring that point to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18621)|
| 5:10:23| Okay, because that's what I'm trying to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18623)|
| 5:10:25| Because if you build an ADU, it's not being rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18625)|
| 5:10:29| It's not being utilized as an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18629)|
| 5:10:31| So is it being permitted to be built in the first place if they're not living at that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18631)|
| 5:10:37| if they're investing from outside the community where I was going with it before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18637)|
| 5:10:45| During the plans review process, because they would need to get a building permit to create this ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18645)|
| 5:10:53| we would verify the home ownership and make sure that the occupant, they have to give us their address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18653)|
| 5:11:00| We would verify their address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18660)|
| 5:11:02| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18662)|
| 5:11:03| You know, there's a lot of times we deal with that with the short-term rental regulations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18663)|
| 5:11:09| So it's not uncommon for the city to confirm residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18669)|
| 5:11:16| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18676)|
| 5:11:17| So, yeah, because basically the way I was seeing it is what they could do is if you want to build an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18677)|
| 5:11:23| you have to live on the property for a limited – you have to live there for at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18683)|
| 5:11:27| So that way, if you're wanting to come in from outside the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18687)|
| 5:11:31| you're going to be deferred from trying to do that in the first place, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18691)|
| 5:11:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18695)|
| 5:11:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18696)|
| 5:11:38| Okay, so do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18698)|
| 5:11:41| Did you – okay, first of all, we had a motion up there on number seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18701)|
| 5:11:47| which has been stricken out, and you're adding it back in with new –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18707)|
| 5:11:51| New language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18711)|
| 5:11:52| New language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18712)|
| 5:11:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18713)|
| 5:11:54| You see that up on the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18714)|
| 5:11:56| Okay, so did we have a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18716)|
| 5:11:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18719)|
| 5:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18720)|
| 5:12:01| Do you all remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18721)|
| 5:12:02| That was a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18722)|
| 5:12:03| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18723)|
| 5:12:04| Just under general regulations for accessory structures, just prior to the ADU section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18724)|
| 5:12:12| no accessory structure may contain both a permanent cooking facility and plumbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18732)|
| 5:12:17| unless the structure also complies with 10.3b, which is the ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18737)|
| 5:12:22| That's the motion and the second, and then we'll get on to the ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18742)|
| 5:12:26| Do we want to take that up first – excuse me – before we take up the second part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18746)|
| 5:12:32| Want to take up the ADU first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18752)|
| 5:12:34| Would that help the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18754)|
| 5:12:36| We've got to take up the ADU first and then come back and add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18756)|
| 5:12:38| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18758)|
| 5:12:40| Okay, so I'm not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18760)|
| 5:12:42| I've kind of lost track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18762)|
| 5:12:43| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18763)|
| 5:12:46| I think Councilman Roberto suggested some stuff and then Councilman Wallace did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18766)|
| 5:12:51| so does someone want to make a – right now it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18771)|
| 5:12:56| I'm fine the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18776)|
| 5:12:58| Right, so the way it is, it applies to all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18778)|
| 5:13:00| So do you want to see where your council members are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18780)|
| 5:13:03| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18783)|
| 5:13:04| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18784)|
| 5:13:06| My motion would be on page 10-4, section B, subsection 2, that that is changed to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18786)|
| 5:13:15| an accessory dwelling unit may be located only on a lot with one single-family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18795)|
| 5:13:21| in RN1 and RN2 with special use approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18801)|
| 5:13:25| and shall be permitted in EN, established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18805)|
| 5:13:29| only if the neighborhood so designates in a new established neighborhood application, EN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18809)|
| 5:13:35| one of the dwelling units must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18815)|
| 5:13:43| Well, you have to split them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18823)|
| 5:13:44| I mean, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18824)|
| 5:13:46| Well, you can vote on one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18826)|
| 5:13:48| I mean, instead of a whole lump, I mean, vote on whether it's a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18828)|
| 5:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18831)|
| 5:13:52| That's a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18832)|
| 5:13:53| I would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18833)|
| 5:13:55| Let's look at accessory dwelling units as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18835)|
| 5:14:03| Right now it's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18843)|
| 5:14:06| Permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18846)|
| 5:14:07| So you want to make that motion first that it's a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18847)|
| 5:14:09| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18849)|
| 5:14:10| So the motion is that ADUs would be a special use, then we'll later decide which districts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18850)|
| 5:14:16| That's basically the way you're going to break it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18856)|
| 5:14:19| Are you all understanding that and comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18859)|
| 5:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18862)|
| 5:14:23| So the motion is that it is a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18863)|
| 5:14:28| All in favor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18868)|
| 5:14:29| Did it get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18869)|
| 5:14:30| I don't think it got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18870)|
| 5:14:31| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18871)|
| 5:14:32| Oh, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18872)|
| 5:14:33| There was no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18873)|
| 5:14:34| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18874)|
| 5:14:35| And no seconds to the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18875)|
| 5:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18876)|
| 5:14:37| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18877)|
| 5:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18878)|
| 5:14:39| Now I got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18879)|
| 5:14:40| You really want everyone to vote on it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18880)|
| 5:14:45| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18885)|
| 5:14:46| I'll second it, and let me make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18886)|
| 5:14:51| Currently, I live in R1A, and a lot of my district is R1A, R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18891)|
| 5:14:57| Duplex is a use-by-right now, and in RECODE, we've made it a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18897)|
| 5:15:03| ADUs are a use-by-right currently, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18903)|
| 5:15:10| So, I mean, if we're going to make duplexes a use-on-review, why are ADUs any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18910)|
| 5:15:15| And I think part of the reason is a duplex isn't in neighboring your backyard where you're grilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18915)|
| 5:15:22| and your kids are playing and all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18922)|
| 5:15:24| I don't think it's a terrible thing to add a process where it's like, hey, dude, I'm building this back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18924)|
| 5:15:29| and you barbecue back here, and by the way, let's tit-for-tat, let's have a conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18929)|
| 5:15:35| So, anyway, that's my thoughts and my logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18935)|
| 5:15:38| If one's going to be a use-on-review, why not the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18938)|
| 5:15:41| So that's why I'm seconding your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18941)|
| 5:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18943)|
| 5:15:44| Let's make a comment before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18944)|
| 5:15:47| Okay, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18947)|
| 5:15:48| I just wanted to say that we're not saying that you have to have an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18948)|
| 5:15:52| At no point are we making anybody have an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18952)|
| 5:15:56| We're just saying if you want one, you may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18956)|
| 5:16:00| But now it seems like we're saying your neighbors don't want you to have one, so you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18960)|
| 5:16:06| That's how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18966)|
| 5:16:07| No, it would just go through the special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18967)|
| 5:16:09| You would have to go through a special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18969)|
| 5:16:12| We're not going district by district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18972)|
| 5:16:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18975)|
| 5:16:16| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18976)|
| 5:16:17| You mean by residential district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18977)|
| 5:16:19| Add that in, but this is just for special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18979)|
| 5:16:23| The only thing we're looking at is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18983)|
| 5:16:24| Okay, let me clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18984)|
| 5:16:25| Right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18985)|
| 5:16:28| Can you say it again and then I'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18988)|
| 5:16:31| So right now accessory dwelling units are a use-by-right in all residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18991)|
| 5:16:36| The change is to say that the accessory dwelling unit would go through the special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=18996)|
| 5:16:42| Okay, each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19002)|
| 5:16:43| And there's nothing else on the table right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19003)|
| 5:16:45| It's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19005)|
| 5:16:46| Okay, so someone needs to ask for special privilege before they can build something on their lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19006)|
| 5:16:51| They would go through the special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19011)|
| 5:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19013)|
| 5:16:54| It's just a notice process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19014)|
| 5:16:55| It's a public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19015)|
| 5:16:56| There's a jillion things in here that are special use, which is a public notice process, which duplexes have now moved to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19016)|
| 5:17:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19025)|
| 5:17:06| But aren't currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19026)|
| 5:17:07| It would treat an ADU the same way a duplex is treated in Recode now, in the version you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19027)|
| 5:17:14| Okay, so if you agree that ADU should be a special use, then you will vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19034)|
| 5:17:20| If you disagree, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19040)|
| 5:17:22| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19042)|
| 5:17:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19044)|
| 5:17:25| How many is that, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19045)|
| 5:17:27| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19047)|
| 5:17:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19048)|
| 5:17:30| So that's, it fails three to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19050)|
| 5:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19056)|
| 5:17:37| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19057)|
| 5:17:38| You want me to move on to the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19058)|
| 5:17:39| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19059)|
| 5:17:40| Okay, so, and now I think especially since we don't have accessory dwelling units as special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19060)|
| 5:17:46| the neighborhoods that, you know, wanted to have some options about whether or not they would have accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19066)|
| 5:17:58| they had, and I already listed the ones I've received already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19078)|
| 5:18:02| If we create this EN where the neighborhood in their application makes a choice about whether or not they would have accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19082)|
| 5:18:11| they would look at design guidelines, the boundaries of the neighborhood, and they'd be working with planning on dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19091)|
| 5:18:19| And one of the choices they would have also is whether or not they would have accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19099)|
| 5:18:24| This lets them look at the infrastructure in their neighborhood and make a decision for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19104)|
| 5:18:31| So I don't know how you want me to word that, Mayor, but basically it would say that we would allow in the EN during the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19111)|
| 5:18:44| for the neighborhood to decide whether or not they would have accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19124)|
| 5:18:52| So, question, let me make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19132)|
| 5:18:55| So the neighborhood would decide whether or not your EN application would have a vote or a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19135)|
| 5:19:07| in whether or not I was able to have an ADU on my property if I applied for one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19147)|
| 5:19:11| No, the neighborhood would apply for established neighborhood status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19151)|
| 5:19:17| The committee that the neighborhood puts together would deal with outreach, and maybe Gerald can talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19157)|
| 5:19:22| They would deal with outreach to all the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19162)|
| 5:19:24| They would talk about the boundary lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19164)|
| 5:19:26| They would then also talk about whether or not they wanted to have accessory dwelling units inside the boundary area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19166)|
| 5:19:34| So it's not one neighbor saying I want it and one not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19174)|
| 5:19:37| So we're going in a totally different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19177)|
| 5:19:39| So now my neighborhood could, if we're not already in EN1, could apply for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19179)|
| 5:19:47| and determine whether or not anyone living within that EN zone would be able to even apply for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19187)|
| 5:19:57| So the EN could actually say that we could say that no, we don't want any ADUs in our EN neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19197)|
| 5:20:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19204)|
| 5:20:05| In the application, the neighborhood would make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19205)|
| 5:20:09| Well, it seems like to me you'd put the motion that it would not be allowed in EN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19209)|
| 5:20:14| and allowed in the other residential zones, and then if that passed, then you'd subdivide that and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19214)|
| 5:20:20| okay, now that it's not allowed, if that passed, you'd say now it's not allowed in EN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19220)|
| 5:20:24| certain neighborhoods would have the right to vote it in or out for their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19224)|
| 5:20:30| Yeah, I don't want to have a blanket that the EN neighborhood has to not have accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19230)|
| 5:20:39| Right now they don't have duplexes in RICO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19239)|
| 5:20:42| So I wanted to give the neighborhood the choice to decide what they wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19242)|
| 5:20:52| And that comes from a lot of outreach into my own neighborhoods and hearing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19252)|
| 5:20:59| and Councilman Wallace, you're right, you know, when you go to a neighborhood meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19259)|
| 5:21:04| the only people that are there are the ones that you're hearing from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19264)|
| 5:21:08| But I've done it enough now where I feel pretty comfortable that there are some neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19268)|
| 5:21:14| that would like this protection and to be able to say, hey, we have a choice and we want to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19274)|
| 5:21:20| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19280)|
| 5:21:22| But I'm trying to figure out how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19282)|
| 5:21:24| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19284)|
| 5:21:25| I mean, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19285)|
| 5:21:27| Well, they make the motion that EN would be allowed to opt in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19287)|
| 5:21:31| EN neighborhoods would be able to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19291)|
| 5:21:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19293)|
| 5:21:34| I think that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19294)|
| 5:21:36| So one of my concerns is that a lot of times people find out what their neighborhood zoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19296)|
| 5:21:44| or what they can and can't do when they go to apply to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19304)|
| 5:21:48| And that's when they find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19308)|
| 5:21:49| So I would be really interested in what would the neighborhood public process be for them to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19309)|
| 5:21:55| if they're not already an EN neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19315)|
| 5:21:57| What would that public process be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19317)|
| 5:22:00| And maybe that is Gerald's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19320)|
| 5:22:03| Gerald or Peter could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19323)|
| 5:22:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19326)|
| 5:22:07| For a neighborhood to apply for EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19327)|
| 5:22:11| The first step would be for a council resolution asking planning staff to work with the neighborhood for EN designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19331)|
| 5:22:20| We would then place that on our work program, work with the mayor's office to assign priority to that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19340)|
| 5:22:29| Then when that task came up on the list, we would work with the neighborhood stakeholder committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19349)|
| 5:22:39| we'd hold community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19359)|
| 5:22:42| There would be a process to notify all the people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19362)|
| 5:22:48| And what we would do, one of the first steps with that stakeholder committee would be to identify some potential boundaries for the EN neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19368)|
| 5:22:57| notify all those folks, have public meetings, work with the stakeholder group for outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19377)|
| 5:23:04| come up with design standards because each EN neighborhood has its design standards, what uses are permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19384)|
| 5:23:13| whether they want ADUs, duplexes, or dog houses, and down to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19393)|
| 5:23:20| Then craft the draft standards, present those to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19400)|
| 5:23:25| If they are accepted by the community, then they would go to the planning commission for review and recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19405)|
| 5:23:32| and would come to the city council basically as a new zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19412)|
| 5:23:39| There would be a requirement for notification of the property owners prior to the planning commission meeting and prior to the city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19419)|
| 5:23:50| Okay. Thank you for pointing that out because the communication piece of it is what I really wanted to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19430)|
| 5:23:56| because there are some neighborhoods that have very robust neighborhood organizations and have high engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19436)|
| 5:24:02| and there are some that have very low engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19442)|
| 5:24:05| And again, we do not want to make changes such as this and then people find out after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19445)|
| 5:24:10| So what you explained, that process to me provides adequate opportunity for engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19450)|
| 5:24:16| and public process for any neighborhoods that would apply with the boundaries, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19456)|
| 5:24:21| for folks to be properly notified and have an opportunity to voice any concerns, et cetera, if they were opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19461)|
| 5:24:29| I'm maybe optimistic or just hoping that we don't get a load of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19469)|
| 5:24:34| but I'm hoping that by the time we get to the second of those neighborhoods that want EN designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19474)|
| 5:24:41| they'll realize that ADUs are not the boogeyman that they think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19481)|
| 5:24:45| Yeah. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19485)|
| 5:24:47| Can I provide a little bit of context and then I'll put Gerald on the spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19487)|
| 5:24:50| Right now the EN district currently allows accessory dwelling units as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19490)|
| 5:24:56| and I'm not sure how many, maybe you can speak to how many applications you've seen in the time you've been with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19496)|
| 5:25:01| Four years I've seen none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19501)|
| 5:25:03| The current EN that exists right now that is on, say, Holson Hills allows ADUs as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19503)|
| 5:25:12| whereas in R1A they're allowed as a use by right. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19512)|
| 5:25:15| No, ADUs are not. Well, no, not. Duplexes are a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19515)|
| 5:25:22| But an ADU in my neighborhood, R1A, is a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19522)|
| 5:25:27| ADUs are not permitted now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19527)|
| 5:25:31| Garage apartments are. I guess that's ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19531)|
| 5:25:35| All right. I consider that an ADU because that's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19535)|
| 5:25:37| Yeah, I'm splitting here. It's just going with what our current definitions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19537)|
| 5:25:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19541)|
| 5:25:44| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19544)|
| 5:25:45| Thank you. This doesn't seem proper that we address this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19545)|
| 5:25:49| This seems something after we pass RECODE that we add or that we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19549)|
| 5:25:54| or we ask the neighborhoods if they want to apply for the EN designation instead of addressing this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19554)|
| 5:26:04| because we haven't even passed RECODE yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19564)|
| 5:26:09| So, I mean, this is, in my opinion, ahead of the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19569)|
| 5:26:16| Which part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19576)|
| 5:26:17| They're trying to define what you can do with EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19577)|
| 5:26:21| Well, that's already defined in the earlier part of the definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19581)|
| 5:26:26| in the neighborhood definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19586)|
| 5:26:28| So I guess I'm confounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19588)|
| 5:26:30| I can't figure out why we're trying to add another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19590)|
| 5:26:33| unless that's the will of the council that we add another designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19593)|
| 5:26:38| No, we're not adding another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19598)|
| 5:26:40| What we're asking now, we're asking quite an extended period of work for the Planning Commission to come up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19600)|
| 5:26:49| If we have neighborhoods that apply for this, and I don't know whether they will or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19609)|
| 5:26:55| I mean, what Mr. Green just said, it's going to be a while before any of this can occur anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19615)|
| 5:27:03| It seems like it's going to be a while before the RECODE isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19623)|
| 5:27:07| It's already been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19627)|
| 5:27:10| I'll try to clarify that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19630)|
| 5:27:12| Vice Mayor, I would say that allowing this change in EN now is very appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19632)|
| 5:27:20| because there are neighborhoods that are wanting an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19640)|
| 5:27:26| and since it's been brought up that maybe we should have another neighborhood residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19646)|
| 5:27:33| that we could talk about whether or not there would be ADUs and duplexes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19653)|
| 5:27:38| that that's not ever picked up any steam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19658)|
| 5:27:41| So this works within the framework that's in RECODE right now, and it gives neighborhoods that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19661)|
| 5:27:50| And I think that it may bring more people to the table that may be willing to support the overall effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19670)|
| 5:28:00| But won't they have that option anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19680)|
| 5:28:02| Not if we don't change the EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19682)|
| 5:28:06| How do they know that we're going to give them the option that they can make a choice in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19686)|
| 5:28:12| for whether they have ADUs or not unless we do this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19692)|
| 5:28:16| They're going to ask for EN status and ask us for that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19696)|
| 5:28:21| But under our existing code, anybody can ask for a change in their neighborhood code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19701)|
| 5:28:26| Why would that not be the case if we pass RECODE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19706)|
| 5:28:31| I'm not sure what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19711)|
| 5:28:33| For instance, Forest Heights changed from R1 to R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19713)|
| 5:28:39| And they went through quite a process to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19719)|
| 5:28:42| And my neighborhood did the same thing many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19722)|
| 5:28:44| And I think Sequoia is even engaged in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19724)|
| 5:28:46| Maybe they're in R1E as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19726)|
| 5:28:48| I know West Hills is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19728)|
| 5:28:49| So why could that not happen if we pass RECODE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19729)|
| 5:28:55| We'd have to create a new residential district because there isn't one that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19735)|
| 5:29:00| Well, but you could change that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19740)|
| 5:29:03| I mean, that's why I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19743)|
| 5:29:07| I'm not sure if we're saying the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19747)|
| 5:29:09| I don't think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19749)|
| 5:29:10| I don't think we're saying the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19750)|
| 5:29:12| So explain again what you are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19752)|
| 5:29:16| I'm proposing that we make a change in established neighborhood in RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19756)|
| 5:29:21| that allows the neighborhood that is applying for EN status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19761)|
| 5:29:25| to determine whether or not they have ADUs in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19765)|
| 5:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19772)|
| 5:29:33| Let's get a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19773)|
| 5:29:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19775)|
| 5:29:36| Is that the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19776)|
| 5:29:37| I'm going to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19777)|
| 5:29:38| I'm going to call on Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19778)|
| 5:29:39| I'd like to see what Mr. Hill has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19779)|
| 5:29:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19780)|
| 5:29:41| We were going to do that before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19781)|
| 5:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19782)|
| 5:29:43| Tim Hill, 311 South Weisgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19783)|
| 5:29:44| There's another group in there that I'd like for you to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19784)|
| 5:29:47| I currently live in EN2 in Old Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19787)|
| 5:29:52| And I would want the same right as someone in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19792)|
| 5:29:55| So we're already in EN, and I want the same right as you would have in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19795)|
| 5:30:02| And I think you're limiting that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19802)|
| 5:30:04| Same right to have an ADU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19804)|
| 5:30:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19806)|
| 5:30:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19807)|
| 5:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19808)|
| 5:30:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19809)|
| 5:30:10| By having the community decide during the EN application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19810)|
| 5:30:12| you're saying that you are limiting your individual right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19812)|
| 5:30:14| I think we need to understand how EN came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19814)|
| 5:30:19| We wanted specific customizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19819)|
| 5:30:22| And in our neighborhood, we basically wanted two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19822)|
| 5:30:25| We wanted to make sure that the houses lined up with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19825)|
| 5:30:30| that we didn't have buck-teeth homes in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19830)|
| 5:30:33| And the other was anything acreage larger than three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19833)|
| 5:30:39| how it would be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19839)|
| 5:30:40| I think that's the only two restrictions that we basically put in R1 EN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19840)|
| 5:30:47| And we looked at Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19847)|
| 5:30:49| They had a few more restrictions, and we didn't want them, those restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19849)|
| 5:30:53| So I would just say that there are R1 EN folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19853)|
| 5:30:58| that just simply want the same rights as R1 as far as ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19858)|
| 5:31:02| And with regard to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19862)|
| 5:31:03| You don't want, as a neighborhood, to be able to restrict your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19863)|
| 5:31:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19867)|
| 5:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19868)|
| 5:31:09| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19869)|
| 5:31:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19870)|
| 5:31:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19871)|
| 5:31:12| And, Mr. Hill, this would only apply to new EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19872)|
| 5:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19873)|
| 5:31:14| I'm glad you clarified that because I wasn't aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19874)|
| 5:31:16| It's not ‑‑ it would not be retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19876)|
| 5:31:18| It's only new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19878)|
| 5:31:19| So if your neighborhood decided they wanted to do it all over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19879)|
| 5:31:22| and say no ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19882)|
| 5:31:23| then I would imagine they would probably be at the bottom of the list for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19883)|
| 5:31:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19887)|
| 5:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19888)|
| 5:31:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19889)|
| 5:31:30| Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19890)|
| 5:31:31| It will take a while for MPs to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19891)|
| 5:31:32| Only for new applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19892)|
| 5:31:33| It's really ‑‑ the idea here is to give neighborhoods that are having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19893)|
| 5:31:40| that don't want to see some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19900)|
| 5:31:43| to have them have that debate within the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19903)|
| 5:31:46| and not have us make that decision for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19906)|
| 5:31:48| Let them talk about it, come to an agreement, and then send it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19908)|
| 5:31:52| If they can't come to agreement, then it would just stay the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19912)|
| 5:31:55| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19915)|
| 5:31:56| And, Ms. Roche, did you want to speak to this, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19916)|
| 5:31:58| Sorry, it's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19918)|
| 5:32:00| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19920)|
| 5:32:01| Tim asked the same question I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19921)|
| 5:32:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19923)|
| 5:32:04| Because I think that would create a lot of nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19924)|
| 5:32:06| But if I'm an EN right now and I don't want ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19926)|
| 5:32:09| could I try and go for this new EN designation, get ADUs out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19929)|
| 5:32:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19935)|
| 5:32:16| When Gerald and I talked about it, it was only for new applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19936)|
| 5:32:19| So if you have a current status in EN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19939)|
| 5:32:21| and you wanted to change it to incorporate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19941)|
| 5:32:24| you'd have to make a new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19944)|
| 5:32:26| Which would create a lot of nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19946)|
| 5:32:30| Well, you'd be grandfathered in if you had something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19950)|
| 5:32:33| I just kind of want to add a little bit to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19953)|
| 5:32:36| I think there's, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19956)|
| 5:32:38| probably about half of the lots in the city would not be able to have an ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19958)|
| 5:32:42| because of the parking requirement, which we asked to be in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19962)|
| 5:32:45| because in our research we said that is the real practical problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19965)|
| 5:32:48| that we see across municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19968)|
| 5:32:50| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19970)|
| 5:32:51| I wanted to make sure you knew why that was being put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19971)|
| 5:32:53| and to keep that in to show parking off street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19973)|
| 5:32:59| The size of the lot and the requirement for the off street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19979)|
| 5:33:02| would keep a lot of lots out of having an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19982)|
| 5:33:05| unfortunately or unfortunately, whichever side of the coin you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19985)|
| 5:33:08| ADUs are a big monetary commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19988)|
| 5:33:10| They're made by property owners 80%, 90% of the time who are living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19990)|
| 5:33:14| They're kind of by default owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19994)|
| 5:33:17| They're making them for long-term purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=19997)|
| 5:33:20| I'm not going to build an ADU to flip my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20000)|
| 5:33:23| I'm glad that Flipper came in and took care of that dilapidated house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20003)|
| 5:33:26| to bring those property values up because dilapidation can bring them down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20006)|
| 5:33:31| And ADUs are, you know, I don't have $100,000 to build an ADU in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20011)|
| 5:33:37| And if I did, I don't know if I would or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20017)|
| 5:33:39| But I just hope to quell some of the fears about ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20019)|
| 5:33:44| is that just because you can doesn't mean they're going to be everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20024)|
| 5:33:49| It's building another structure on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20029)|
| 5:33:51| That's a big commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20031)|
| 5:33:52| That's utilities and foundations and permits and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20032)|
| 5:33:57| I think there's a lot of different compromise positions we could do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20037)|
| 5:34:00| One that we would like to see is the owner occupied requirement go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20040)|
| 5:34:04| and that it would become a special use instead of permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20044)|
| 5:34:09| That continues to give the neighborhood a voice into every ADU being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20049)|
| 5:34:14| and takes away that private property right limitation on making it the owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20054)|
| 5:34:20| Most will be by default, so there won't be that many issues anyway on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20060)|
| 5:34:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20064)|
| 5:34:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20065)|
| 5:34:26| Okay, who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20066)|
| 5:34:27| Next, Councilwoman Singh and then more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20067)|
| 5:34:31| I wanted to say that this EN, the new EN designation for certain neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20071)|
| 5:34:36| and then allowing it to have that right to vote out ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20076)|
| 5:34:41| this just seems like a way that people are asking for special privileges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20081)|
| 5:34:45| to get out of what RECODE is one of the things that RECODE is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20085)|
| 5:34:50| If we're going to start letting certain neighborhoods have special privileges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20090)|
| 5:34:53| I think we need to open that up a little bit wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20093)|
| 5:34:57| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20097)|
| 5:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20099)|
| 5:35:00| Now, I'm just going to be myself and be honest and say what I think because that's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20100)|
| 5:35:05| So here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20105)|
| 5:35:07| I've heard that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20107)|
| 5:35:08| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20108)|
| 5:35:09| Here I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20109)|
| 5:35:10| I think it goes with . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20110)|
| 5:35:11| Is this the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20111)|
| 5:35:12| Yes, the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20112)|
| 5:35:13| First time for the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20113)|
| 5:35:15| Be honest with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20115)|
| 5:35:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20116)|
| 5:35:18| So I'm not trying to point fingers at any neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20118)|
| 5:35:22| I supported special use, which, let me be clear, calling it special apparently has caused some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20122)|
| 5:35:29| because it's what we all know in current code as a use on review, which is a public notice process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20129)|
| 5:35:35| and it caused the confusion here of thinking it means it's special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20135)|
| 5:35:38| It's not special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20138)|
| 5:35:39| It's a public notice process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20139)|
| 5:35:41| It's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20141)|
| 5:35:43| So I've never been down with the fact that we're changing the name for the sake of changing the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20143)|
| 5:35:47| but I've told you what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20147)|
| 5:35:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20149)|
| 5:35:51| These are neighborhoods that killed the traffic calming process under the Haslam administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20151)|
| 5:35:56| because they couldn't agree on speed humps, and they got into fights with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20156)|
| 5:36:00| I'm not talking about any particular neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20160)|
| 5:36:02| but people living next door to each other and across from each other couldn't get along about . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20162)|
| 5:36:07| Still aren't getting along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20167)|
| 5:36:09| Speed humps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20169)|
| 5:36:10| And so now we're going to say that they're going to agree on having ADUs or not having ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20170)|
| 5:36:15| and so a fair way of dealing with it is a use on review where people get the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20175)|
| 5:36:24| and then there's standards for the MPC to vote up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20184)|
| 5:36:29| and I know Mr. Hill and I have talked about this and may or may not agree on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20189)|
| 5:36:34| but at least it's a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20194)|
| 5:36:36| A sign goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20196)|
| 5:36:37| This is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20197)|
| 5:36:39| And in my neighborhood, because we have special . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20199)|
| 5:36:41| Not special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20201)|
| 5:36:42| Let's get rid of that word altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20202)|
| 5:36:44| Nobody's special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20204)|
| 5:36:47| Or everybody's special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20207)|
| 5:36:48| Everybody's special or nobody's special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20208)|
| 5:36:50| Certificates of accomplishment for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20210)|
| 5:36:53| We have small lots of record, and so if a neighbor's going to build a shed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20213)|
| 5:36:57| you pretty much have to do a variance hearing, and your neighbor gets a notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20217)|
| 5:37:01| and you can have a negotiation conversation of like, hey, man, can you move your shed over a foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20221)|
| 5:37:06| Or, hey, I'm going to do an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20226)|
| 5:37:08| Well, do you mind because I've got a garden over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20228)|
| 5:37:10| Like it opens up a conversation versus that went up, they got their building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20230)|
| 5:37:15| I just think the use and review process for it, I'm just going to keep calling it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20235)|
| 5:37:19| I'm so sorry, levels the playing field and makes it more fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20239)|
| 5:37:25| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20245)|
| 5:37:26| Anyway, so that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20246)|
| 5:37:27| That's all I wanted to say, and that's why I supported that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20247)|
| 5:37:29| because I think it makes it more fair in making people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20249)|
| 5:37:33| And what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20253)|
| 5:37:34| Is it going to be 50%, 50% plus one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20254)|
| 5:37:37| Hey, I mean, I've been there with voting for H1 in neighborhoods, and it doesn't go pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20257)|
| 5:37:42| So I think the use and review is the way to be fair about it, and that's why I supported that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20262)|
| 5:37:48| Well, and I put the choice in there so that there was an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20268)|
| 5:37:52| Well, currently in EN, they don't allow duplexes at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20272)|
| 5:37:56| So we could change it to say there's no ADUs, and then the neighborhood would still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20276)|
| 5:38:01| it would be a neighborhood-led process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20281)|
| 5:38:03| and the neighborhood would have to bring it to planning and then come to council eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20283)|
| 5:38:09| And if we didn't feel like they had done a good job with outreach, then we could vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20289)|
| 5:38:14| So if the choice is the issue, we could just say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20294)|
| 5:38:17| I wanted to give them the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20297)|
| 5:38:19| So in the current zoning, EN1 and EN2, duplexes are used on review, and so are accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20299)|
| 5:38:29| True statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20309)|
| 5:38:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20310)|
| 5:38:32| In the EN, duplexes are just not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20312)|
| 5:38:39| Okay, so is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20319)|
| 5:38:43| I make the motion that we, if there's more support for doing it as just a no as opposed to a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20323)|
| 5:38:53| I thought there would be more support for choice, but I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20333)|
| 5:38:58| We'll make your motion and we'll see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20338)|
| 5:39:01| I think we've debated this long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20341)|
| 5:39:03| Let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20343)|
| 5:39:04| That we would give an option in EN for new neighborhoods that are making an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20344)|
| 5:39:11| to choose whether or not ADUs are allowed within the boundary lines that they determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20351)|
| 5:39:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20359)|
| 5:39:24| If I change that to that there's not a choice, no, do I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20364)|
| 5:39:32| How about if I make a motion again for use on review or special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20372)|
| 5:39:37| That already failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20377)|
| 5:39:39| Okay, so you didn't get a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20379)|
| 5:39:43| Do you have another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20383)|
| 5:39:45| The other motion would be the same except that we say that in EN there are no accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20385)|
| 5:39:52| just like there's no duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20392)|
| 5:39:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20397)|
| 5:40:01| That fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20401)|
| 5:40:03| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20403)|
| 5:40:05| Now make your other motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20405)|
| 5:40:07| The one you started out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20407)|
| 5:40:08| I'm sorry, Councilwoman McKenzie, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20408)|
| 5:40:10| Do you want to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20410)|
| 5:40:11| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20411)|
| 5:40:16| The first one was on number seven on page 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20416)|
| 5:40:21| That that changes to no accessory structure may contain both a permanent cooking facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20421)|
| 5:40:26| and plumbing unless the structure also complies with section 10.3B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20426)|
| 5:40:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20431)|
| 5:40:33| All right, I'm cooking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20433)|
| 5:40:35| You're really cooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20435)|
| 5:40:38| But no plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20438)|
| 5:40:41| Okay, that was an energetic second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20441)|
| 5:40:44| So nothing has changed on ADUs at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20444)|
| 5:40:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20448)|
| 5:40:49| And now just right above that, at number seven, we have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20449)|
| 5:40:54| as stated by Councilman Roberto and is listed up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20454)|
| 5:41:02| Are you all ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20462)|
| 5:41:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20464)|
| 5:41:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20465)|
| 5:41:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20466)|
| 5:41:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20467)|
| 5:41:08| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20468)|
| 5:41:10| Okay, that passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20470)|
| 5:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20474)|
| 5:41:15| Certificate of accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20475)|
| 5:41:20| Okay, anything else on 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20480)|
| 5:41:25| Anything else on 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20485)|
| 5:41:28| Okay, there's still coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20488)|
| 5:41:30| And remember, since this is going back to MPC, we really need to keep powering through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20490)|
| 5:41:36| We are on 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20496)|
| 5:41:37| Now, actually, we have been sitting here for about three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20497)|
| 5:41:41| We need to take a bathroom break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20501)|
| 5:41:43| And we will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20503)|
| 5:41:45| Everyone, please show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20505)|
| 5:41:47| Okay, if everyone would have a seat, we will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20507)|
| 5:41:51| I'm having a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20511)|
| 5:41:52| I hope everybody else is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20512)|
| 5:41:57| It's fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20517)|
| 5:41:58| George, you having a good time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20518)|
| 5:42:00| Coffee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20520)|
| 5:42:03| I'm going to need some more here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20523)|
| 5:42:06| Okay, yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20526)|
| 5:42:07| So, I hate to say this, but Peter wants to go back to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20527)|
| 5:42:15| He saw something, and this will be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20535)|
| 5:42:18| I told him no, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20538)|
| 5:42:20| Oh, you told him no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20540)|
| 5:42:21| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20541)|
| 5:42:23| Peter's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20543)|
| 5:42:26| We're going to let him do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20546)|
| 5:42:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20547)|
| 5:42:28| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20548)|
| 5:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20549)|
| 5:42:31| The page is going to be 10.10, but it stems from 10-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20551)|
| 5:42:35| where it talks about the general regulations for accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20555)|
| 5:42:39| 10.3A5 says detached accessory structures, including those listed in this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20559)|
| 5:42:47| and section 10.4 must be set back five feet from any lot line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20567)|
| 5:42:50| unless otherwise permitted or restricted by this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20570)|
| 5:42:53| So, we've got the standard of five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20573)|
| 5:42:55| What we're getting at is we're going to protect the corner side yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20575)|
| 5:42:58| from detached garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20578)|
| 5:43:01| So, I go to detached garages on page 10-10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20581)|
| 5:43:05| and there's no provisions to set the detached garage back further from the corner side yard from five foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20585)|
| 5:43:11| So, I'm going to propose that we add 10.3P3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20591)|
| 5:43:19| 10.3P3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20599)|
| 5:43:21| Okay, so you have P1, 2, and now you want to add a 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20601)|
| 5:43:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20605)|
| 5:43:26| Right before the Q?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20606)|
| 5:43:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20607)|
| 5:43:28| And I propose it say corner side setbacks shall be the same as the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20608)|
| 5:43:39| I make a motion to accept Peter's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20619)|
| 5:43:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20622)|
| 5:43:46| Okay, any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20626)|
| 5:43:48| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20628)|
| 5:43:50| Sorry, one of my main job duties is to just keep everything neat and tidy here on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20630)|
| 5:43:56| So, would it be okay, Peter, if we changed it to corner side setbacks shall be the same as those for primary side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20636)|
| 5:44:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20644)|
| 5:44:06| And I appreciate the use of the word shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20646)|
| 5:44:09| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20649)|
| 5:44:10| I don't like the word may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20650)|
| 5:44:13| Corner side setbacks shall be the same as those for the primary structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20653)|
| 5:44:24| Okay, everybody cool with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20664)|
| 5:44:27| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20667)|
| 5:44:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20670)|
| 5:44:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20671)|
| 5:44:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20672)|
| 5:44:33| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20673)|
| 5:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20674)|
| 5:44:42| It said unanimous vote already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20682)|
| 5:44:46| She can read our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20686)|
| 5:44:47| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20687)|
| 5:44:48| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20688)|
| 5:44:51| Just to clarify, this is for ADU, the setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20691)|
| 5:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20694)|
| 5:44:55| This is for detached garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20695)|
| 5:44:58| We don't want to have detached garages five foot from the corner side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20698)|
| 5:45:04| For an ADU, what's the setback off the property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20704)|
| 5:45:07| It's the same as a detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20707)|
| 5:45:10| It would be eight feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20710)|
| 5:45:17| We're not going to allow discussion of ADUs anymore, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20717)|
| 5:45:20| This is a general building code question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20720)|
| 5:45:23| But I'm just curious, as far as an additional dwelling unit, how far off the property line does that have to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20723)|
| 5:45:31| If it's in an accessory structure, at the rear or interior side, it's going to be five foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20731)|
| 5:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20742)|
| 5:45:44| And there's a further setback from the street, which is your front yard or your corner side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20744)|
| 5:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20748)|
| 5:45:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20749)|
| 5:45:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20750)|
| 5:45:53| And I'm going to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20753)|
| 5:45:54| I'll look that up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20754)|
| 5:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20762)|
| 5:46:03| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20763)|
| 5:46:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20764)|
| 5:46:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20765)|
| 5:46:06| So, Councilwoman Ryder, are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20766)|
| 5:46:08| Yeah, I'm on to Chapter 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20768)|
| 5:46:10| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20770)|
| 5:46:11| I'm leaving Peter in the dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20771)|
| 5:46:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20772)|
| 5:46:13| That's right, Peter in the dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20773)|
| 5:46:14| We are on Article 11, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20774)|
| 5:46:16| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20776)|
| 5:46:17| Do we need any kind of review first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20777)|
| 5:46:20| White sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20780)|
| 5:46:21| No review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20781)|

| 5:46:27| Does anybody need an overview from Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20787)|
| 5:46:29| Do you have a chance to look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20789)|
| 5:46:30| Is there anything in particular you feel compelled to point out, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20790)|
| 5:46:35| I think it's pretty obvious that the major change in Article 11 is with the general applicability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20795)|
| 5:46:42| Section 11-1, trying to clarify for redevelopment properties the point at which they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20802)|
| 5:46:52| comply with all street parking for redevelopment of existing developed areas, make it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20812)|
| 5:47:01| to redevelop properties without the parking standards hindering redevelopment of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20821)|
| 5:47:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20827)|
| 5:47:08| Any thoughts, Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20828)|
| 5:47:10| Oh, is my light on for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20830)|
| 5:47:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20832)|
| 5:47:13| I'm asking whatever's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20833)|
| 5:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20834)|
| 5:47:15| So, just, well, I do have something on the next part, but let me just ask you about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20835)|
| 5:47:18| part because here in mine it's pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20838)|
| 5:47:20| I don't know if that's the way I printed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20840)|
| 5:47:22| But, so this will make it easier if you're just doing interior stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20842)|
| 5:47:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20847)|
| 5:47:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20848)|
| 5:47:29| We've run into a lot of issues where property owners want to invest in their property on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20849)|
| 5:47:36| the interior and it meets the current threshold of 50% of the appraised or assessed value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20856)|
| 5:47:43| So, our folks are very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20863)|
| 5:47:45| They say, hell, you have to create a conforming parking lot now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20865)|
| 5:47:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20870)|
| 5:47:51| And that has caused a lot of heartache and headache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20871)|
| 5:47:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20876)|
| 5:47:57| So, we have worked extensively with the engineering department to make sure that we're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20877)|
| 5:48:02| a safe environment, making sure that traffic is, the traffic safety is preserved and pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20882)|
| 5:48:09| safety is preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20889)|
| 5:48:12| And we've limited the parking lot upgrades to projects where they're touching the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20892)|
| 5:48:19| lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20899)|
| 5:48:20| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20900)|
| 5:48:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20901)|
| 5:48:22| I bless this with a hallelujah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20902)|
| 5:48:24| I'm very happy to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20904)|
| 5:48:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20905)|
| 5:48:26| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20906)|
| 5:48:27| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20907)|
| 5:48:30| Can I ask about page 1117, outdoor storage of recreational vehicles, no trailer licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20910)|
| 5:48:42| to transport either recreational vehicles or equipment or other, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20922)|
| 5:48:47| Are these, who are they licensed by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20927)|
| 5:48:52| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20932)|
| 5:48:55| I'm on the wrong, yeah, I'm on the right page now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20935)|
| 5:49:00| Page 1117, section 1112, towards the bottom third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20940)|
| 5:49:05| Part A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20945)|
| 5:49:06| Yeah, Part A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20946)|
| 5:49:07| Licensed by the state, the license tag that identifies it as a trailer that hauls vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20947)|
| 5:49:17| or equipment, the commercial, either the commercial tag for commercial equipment or the recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20957)|
| 5:49:23| vehicle tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20963)|
| 5:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20969)|
| 5:49:30| So that's not like your standard trailer that's carrying lawn equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20970)|
| 5:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20980)|
| 5:49:49| So our existing ordinance only allows parking forward of the front building lot line for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20989)|
| 5:49:54| only 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20994)|
| 5:49:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20998)|
| 5:49:59| But this is seven days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=20999)|
| 5:50:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21004)|
| 5:50:07| This provision is more lenient than the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21007)|
| 5:50:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21012)|
| 5:50:20| And was that per request from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21020)|
| 5:50:25| I'm just curious why it went from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21025)|
| 5:50:26| I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21026)|
| 5:50:28| I think it was in recognition that I may have them, trying to think, my friend Rusty come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21028)|
| 5:50:37| who has an RV and may visit for four or five days and we don't want to penalize those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21037)|
| 5:50:44| who have visitors with an RV and felt that a week was a reasonable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21044)|
| 5:50:50| 48 hours is fairly short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21050)|
| 5:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21056)|
| 5:50:57| So we've gone from 48 hours to seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21057)|
| 5:51:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21060)|
| 5:51:07| Anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21067)|
| 5:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21068)|
| 5:51:09| If you would look please on page, this is again from my white sheet, on page 11-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21069)|
| 5:51:20| The very top 11.6G4 of the design of off-street parking facilities, we want to end the sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21080)|
| 5:51:31| after at terminal islands, which is the very, you know, only the first ten or so words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21091)|
| 5:51:38| and then delete the remaining portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21098)|
| 5:51:41| And the reason why is the omitted wording will be moved to article 12.6B on page 12-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21101)|
| 5:51:50| And Peter, that was his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21110)|
| 5:51:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21112)|
| 5:51:53| Those size limitations or mandates are based on landscaping needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21113)|
| 5:51:59| As talking with Casey Krause and what's required to maintain the landscaping within islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21119)|
| 5:52:05| So we wanted to move this to the appropriate location in the next article in the landscape portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21125)|
| 5:52:14| So it's only being omitted because it's in the wrong section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21134)|
| 5:52:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21136)|
| 5:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21137)|
| 5:52:18| It's going to be inserted in the correct location and landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21138)|
| 5:52:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21141)|
| 5:52:22| So is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21142)|
| 5:52:23| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21143)|
| 5:52:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21144)|
| 5:52:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21145)|
| 5:52:26| Everyone's comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21146)|
| 5:52:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21148)|
| 5:52:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21149)|
| 5:52:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21150)|
| 5:52:31| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21151)|
| 5:52:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21154)|
| 5:52:36| Anything else for 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21156)|
| 5:52:43| We'll move to 12, landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21163)|
| 5:52:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21166)|

| 5:52:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21169)|
| 5:52:53| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21173)|
| 5:52:55| Page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21175)|
| 5:52:56| And I don't know what you guys have for breakfast or dinner, but I am lightheaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21176)|

| 5:53:15| And this is on page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21195)|
| 5:53:16| Smelling what's in my coffee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21196)|
| 5:53:21| On page 11-1, section 11.14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21201)|
| 5:53:29| It says all parking lots must meet the requirements of section 11.2, 11.11, 11.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21209)|
| 5:53:35| And just wondering why was 11.3, which seems rather important, left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21215)|
| 5:53:43| 11.3, location and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21223)|
| 5:53:47| You're on 11.1A4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21227)|
| 5:53:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21231)|
| 5:53:53| Where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21233)|
| 5:53:54| Page 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21234)|
| 5:53:56| 11-1, section 11.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21236)|
| 5:54:00| A4 is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21240)|
| 5:54:01| A4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21241)|
| 5:54:02| A4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21242)|
| 5:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21243)|
| 5:54:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21244)|
| 5:54:05| And so you're asking where is 11.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21245)|
| 5:54:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21246)|
| 5:54:07| Why is 11.3 not also a section that location and setback that needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21247)|
| 5:54:13| Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21253)|
| 5:54:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21254)|
| 5:54:15| That's because when we're doing our plan review, if they're reusing existing parking, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21255)|
| 5:54:21| If it's previously approved and now it's not, it doesn't have to meet the current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21261)|
| 5:54:27| We identified the general requirements and the outdoor storage of commercial vehicles and RVs so that we can use it proactively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21267)|
| 5:54:35| or reactively when we get complaints as the general stuff that we deal with as opposed to during plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21275)|
| 5:54:46| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21286)|
| 5:54:47| Did I talk you in circles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21287)|
| 5:54:52| That's a general statement so that we can say that these three sections within the article apply no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21292)|
| 5:55:02| whether you're getting a building permit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21302)|
| 5:55:05| And so you look at the general 11.2, it says you can't store stuff on off-street parking facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21305)|
| 5:55:16| It's the very generic stuff that we utilize in the absence of a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21316)|
| 5:55:26| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21326)|
| 5:55:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21328)|
| 5:55:29| Well, again, I'm tired and it's late, but I don't understand why 11.3 doesn't also apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21329)|
| 5:55:38| It applies when we're reviewing for the issuance of a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21338)|
| 5:55:45| That statement that you're questioning is put in there so that we have tools to go out and ding you for storing stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21345)|
| 5:55:55| in your parking lot or you're storing an RV or you're storing a commercial vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21355)|
| 5:56:03| I think trying to add to what Peter said, key phrase in A4 is all parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21363)|
| 5:56:13| Which gets to the storage materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21373)|
| 5:56:15| In reviewing for a permit, that's new parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21375)|
| 5:56:18| New parking lots have to comply with 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21378)|
| 5:56:25| This provides Peter and his staff with the ability to, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21385)|
| 5:56:31| enforce storage materials in an existing parking lot that take away from the parking required for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21391)|
| 5:56:40| And it's sort of really cutting thinly the provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21400)|
| 5:56:47| but that was the intent to allow enforcement options for existing parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21407)|
| 5:56:51| to make sure they do not do things which were not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21411)|
| 5:56:57| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21417)|
| 5:56:59| I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21419)|
| 5:57:01| Page 11-17, outdoor storage of commercial vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21421)|
| 5:57:07| That's section 11.11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21427)|
| 5:57:18| This is a much expanded permission over what is currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21438)|
| 5:57:28| The community forum had mentioned an excerpt from the existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21448)|
| 5:57:33| which we failed to include and left at your desks at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21453)|
| 5:57:43| What 11.11 says is as long as you can put them indoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21463)|
| 5:57:52| you can have as many school buses and other vehicles, you just can't have them outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21472)|
| 5:57:59| I question if that's really what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21479)|
| 5:58:03| Now, given the fact that you did thankfully make the amendment limiting the total out-accessory buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21483)|
| 5:58:13| earlier in this meeting, this is less ominous, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21493)|
| 5:58:19| But at the same time, I would ask that you consider what is in the existing zoning ordinance for limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21499)|
| 5:58:27| which actually limits the number of school buses and so on that you can keep on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21507)|
| 5:58:31| whether they're indoors or outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21511)|
| 5:58:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21517)|
| 5:58:38| And the other thing is what Ms. Ryder was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21518)|
| 5:58:41| Councilwoman Ryder was talking about with trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21521)|
| 5:58:47| If somebody has a hauling trailer for lawnmowers or their boat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21527)|
| 5:58:54| are those I guess licensing by the state gives me a bit of heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21534)|
| 5:59:01| With a hauling trailer for somebody who has a boat or some other vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21541)|
| 5:59:10| would that not come under the requirements that will affect licensed trailers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21550)|
| 5:59:16| Because if it doesn't, you'll be able to have these things in parts of the yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21556)|
| 5:59:21| that would not necessarily make for an attractive block face on your street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21561)|
| 5:59:28| And so I would ask that you also look at that to see if those trailers are included in the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21568)|
| 5:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21577)|
| 5:59:40| Any comments from Council on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21580)|
| 5:59:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21585)|
| 5:59:46| We will move on to 12, landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21586)|
| 5:59:54| We've got a couple of requests on our staff-initiated changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21594)|
| 6:00:00| Are there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21600)|
| 6:00:05| Is there anything particularly you want to say, Gerald, going through here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21605)|
| 6:00:08| There were no significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21608)|
| 6:00:11| The clarification that this applies to does not apply to routine landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21611)|
| 6:00:16| or routine maintenance of landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21616)|
| 6:00:18| Some clarification of the parking lot parameter landscape requirements on page 12-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21618)|
| 6:00:29| Again, no major changes in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21629)|
| 6:00:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21635)|
| 6:00:36| If you look at our sheet, number 7, which is on page 3 of this white sheet, staff-initiated changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21636)|
| 6:00:44| staff has asked on page 12-2, 12.2C, it's up at the top of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21644)|
| 6:00:52| where it says minor changes to approved landscape plans, delete zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21652)|
| 6:00:58| and insert Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21658)|
| 6:01:04| Planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21664)|
| 6:01:05| Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21665)|
| 6:01:06| Just planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21666)|
| 6:01:07| Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21667)|
| 6:01:09| This is to comply with recode article 16.4CD on page 16-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21669)|
| 6:01:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21676)|
| 6:01:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21678)|
| 6:01:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21679)|
| 6:01:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21680)|
| 6:01:21| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21681)|
| 6:01:22| And also, page 12-5, on 12, which is 12.6, interior parking lot landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21682)|
| 6:01:32| looking down at B, and this is to revise as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21692)|
| 6:01:38| Parking lot islands must be a minimum of 120 square feet in single rows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21698)|
| 6:01:45| Double rows of parking must provide parking lot islands that are a minimum of 240 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21705)|
| 6:01:51| This is what we took out a minute ago when we ended at Terminal Islands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21711)|
| 6:01:57| and this is where it's going, per request from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21717)|
| 6:02:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21723)|
| 6:02:04| I don't have anything to say about that, right, Joyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21724)|
| 6:02:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21726)|
| 6:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21727)|
| 6:02:08| All right, so we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21728)|
| 6:02:09| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21729)|
| 6:02:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21730)|
| 6:02:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21731)|
| 6:02:12| Let's just kind of clean up stuff from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21732)|
| 6:02:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21735)|
| 6:02:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21736)|
| 6:02:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21737)|
| 6:02:18| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21738)|
| 6:02:19| Anything else from staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21739)|
| 6:02:20| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21740)|
| 6:02:21| I was opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21741)|
| 6:02:23| Oh, one opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21743)|
| 6:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21744)|
| 6:02:25| Okay, so that passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21745)|
| 6:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21748)|
| 6:02:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21751)|
| 6:02:32| Anything else from council on 12 before we see what our audience has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21752)|
| 6:02:41| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21761)|
| 6:02:43| Well, can I just bring your attention to page 12-4, section 12-5, parking lot perimeter landscape, section A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21763)|
| 6:02:54| That sentence, sorry, the sentence at the very end of section A there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21774)|
| 6:03:00| parking lots of less than 10,000 square feet or more in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21780)|
| 6:03:07| Are they less or are they more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21787)|
| 6:03:09| It should be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21789)|
| 6:03:10| Thank you for catching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21790)|
| 6:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21791)|
| 6:03:12| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21792)|
| 6:03:13| Parking lots of less than 10,000 square feet in area, so strike or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21793)|
| 6:03:18| I make a motion to strike or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21798)|
| 6:03:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21800)|
| 6:03:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21802)|
| 6:03:23| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21803)|
| 6:03:27| You're following well in the footsteps of your predecessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21807)|
| 6:03:31| They might help with cheat sheets and reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21811)|
| 6:03:34| And, again, so many people have looked at these, you know, and so it takes a village, as I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21814)|
| 6:03:42| I don't even know where that one came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21822)|
| 6:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21824)|
| 6:03:46| So the motion is to strike or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21826)|
| 6:03:48| Is that all we need to strike, the or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21828)|
| 6:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21831)|
| 6:03:52| We'll get a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21832)|
| 6:03:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21833)|
| 6:03:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21834)|
| 6:03:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21835)|
| 6:03:56| That is stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21836)|
| 6:03:57| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21837)|
| 6:04:02| Anything else from council before I call on Ms. Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21842)|
| 6:04:07| You wanted to speak, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21847)|
| 6:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21849)|
| 6:04:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21850)|
| 6:04:11| Ms. Feld, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21851)|
| 6:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21855)|
| 6:04:16| And thank you for the pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21856)|
| 6:04:19| Was that Councilman Saunders and who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21859)|
| 6:04:21| It's about time for breakfast, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21861)|
| 6:04:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21863)|
| 6:04:24| Well, anyway, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21864)|
| 6:04:25| So this is the only issue I'm going to address tonight, so I hope maybe you'll be a little bit lenient in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21865)|
| 6:04:32| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21872)|
| 6:04:37| And I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville and as a member of the board of Trees Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21877)|
| 6:04:45| And I emailed those amendments to you, but just in case you didn't get to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21885)|
| 6:04:50| or you want to look at it while I'm talking, I also distributed copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21890)|
| 6:04:54| So we all know that trees and landscaping make a city more beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21894)|
| 6:04:58| but I hope that council also understands the important environmental, health, social,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21898)|
| 6:05:04| and economic role that trees and landscaping play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21904)|
| 6:05:07| and the contribution they make to the quality of life of a city as well as its economic vitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21907)|
| 6:05:14| You've all heard me tout the numerous benefits of trees and landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21914)|
| 6:05:18| so I'm not going to go through that list again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21918)|
| 6:05:20| but I do want to zero in on just a couple of benefits that are particularly salient right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21920)|
| 6:05:26| A few months ago, Knoxville experienced flooding to a degree it had never seen before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21926)|
| 6:05:31| and we've been told to expect this to happen again in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21931)|
| 6:05:36| Landscaped areas absorb rainfall and stormwater runoff and play an important role in reducing flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21936)|
| 6:05:44| Knoxville is preparing for population growth and increased development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21944)|
| 6:05:49| which will result in a significant loss of existing green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21949)|
| 6:05:53| Given this, we think the responsible course of action is to include green space wherever we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21953)|
| 6:06:01| Also, the city recently unveiled new goals for its sustainability program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21961)|
| 6:06:06| a 50% reduction in city government emissions below 2005 levels by 2030| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21966)|
| 6:06:12| and an 80% drop in the city's overall emissions from all sources by 2050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21972)|
| 6:06:19| With these goals, the city has rightly and proudly called itself an agent of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21979)|
| 6:06:25| It's the kind of thing that makes you proud to live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21985)|
| 6:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21988)|
| 6:06:30| A new study this year looked at savings generated by urban tree cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21990)|
| 6:06:35| Because trees provide shade and cool the surrounding air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21995)|
| 6:06:39| savings in air conditioning costs across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=21999)|
| 6:06:42| they looked at 97 cities, and they generalized from the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22002)|
| 6:06:47| Air conditioning costs across the country were estimated to be approximately $12 billion annually due to tree cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22007)|
| 6:06:57| The study also found, because they were looking at costs in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22017)|
| 6:07:01| the study also found that tree cover reduces heat-related injuries as well as heat-related deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22021)|
| 6:07:09| particularly in areas where people are less likely to have air conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22029)|
| 6:07:14| Both of these findings are especially notable since temperatures are projected to rise in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22034)|
| 6:07:22| Again, given Knoxville's goal of being a greener, more sustainable city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22042)|
| 6:07:27| we think the responsible course of action is to include green space wherever we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22047)|
| 6:07:34| We are aware that some developers object to the inclusion of these amendments in our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22054)|
| 6:07:40| but they should consider that research shows that people actually spend more time and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22060)|
| 6:07:45| in commercial developments that are well landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22065)|
| 6:07:49| People like to go where it looks good and where there's shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22069)|
| 6:07:54| We're also aware that the city has had questions about the enforcement and administration of aspects of these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22074)|
| 6:08:01| like a landscape bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22081)|
| 6:08:03| But I can tell you that we've looked at the ordinances of many cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22083)|
| 6:08:06| I've looked at the ordinances of a lot of cities, some smaller, some larger, some the same size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22086)|
| 6:08:14| and most in the South that include these amendments, including a landscape bond and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22094)|
| 6:08:21| Clearly, there's a way to do this, and we don't accept the argument that these amendments would be overly onerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22101)|
| 6:08:27| for either developers or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22107)|
| 6:08:31| Scenic Knoxville and Trees Knoxville are proposing these three amendments be added to Article 12 of RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22111)|
| 6:08:41| and we've tried to write them up in amendment form, so I call them shovel-ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22121)|
| 6:08:46| and I know that if passed, they'll certainly undergo scrutiny by the Planning Department and by the Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22126)|
| 6:08:52| but they're basically ready to be inserted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22132)|
| 6:08:59| So each of these amendments involve setting up a tree mitigation bank, a landscape bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22139)|
| 6:09:08| and enhanced standards for smaller parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22148)|
| 6:09:12| and they will result in more and higher-quality trees and landscaping throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22152)|
| 6:09:17| providing numerous important benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22157)|
| 6:09:20| A tree mitigation bank will provide dollars for landscaping on public property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22160)|
| 6:09:25| and level the playing field between developers, because right now, if a developer can't meet the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22165)|
| 6:09:31| they just get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22171)|
| 6:09:32| Lauren Ryder can tell you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22172)|
| 6:09:35| I didn't have to meet it, but it was a pain in the rear, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22175)|
| 6:09:39| But you couldn't meet it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22179)|
| 6:09:41| I couldn't meet it, but it also didn't apply to my site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22181)|
| 6:09:44| Oh, it didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22184)|
| 6:09:45| Oh, I thought you were required to plant, like, 0.25 trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22185)|
| 6:09:48| 0.27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22188)|
| 6:09:49| 0.27, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22189)|
| 6:09:51| That was only if my site were at least a half an acre, so it was kind of a miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22191)|
| 6:09:55| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22195)|
| 6:09:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22196)|
| 6:09:57| But nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22197)|
| 6:09:59| Nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22199)|
| 6:10:01| So a tree mitigation bank will provide, it will level the playing field between developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22201)|
| 6:10:13| A landscape bond will increase the likelihood of healthy landscaping over the long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22213)|
| 6:10:19| and relieve citizens of the unfair burden of having to police and report violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22219)|
| 6:10:24| and that's what it will come down to without a landscape bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22224)|
| 6:10:28| It's just going to be up to citizens to notice that there are dead or dying trees and landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22228)|
| 6:10:35| and to report it to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22235)|
| 6:10:40| And the standards for smaller parking lots will add green space without being overly restrictive or burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22240)|
| 6:10:47| And I know that there have been some concerns about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22247)|
| 6:10:50| and we have definitely written this with not being overly burdensome to small parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22250)|
| 6:10:58| So under 5,000 feet has no requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22258)|
| 6:11:04| Between 5,000 and 10,000 feet, all we're asking for is a three-foot landscaped median perimeter buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22264)|
| 6:11:13| between the edge of the parking lot and the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22273)|
| 6:11:17| It's really minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22277)|
| 6:11:22| And to repeat a discussion I had with somebody today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22282)|
| 6:11:29| most of the time this will only apply to new development, obviously, and to redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22289)|
| 6:11:35| but only redevelopment that will trigger it, and that's when there's more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22295)|
| 6:11:41| If the parking lot is added onto, it's only the new part that will have to come into compliance with these requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22301)|
| 6:11:48| or if the project is more than 50% of the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22308)|
| 6:11:57| The total parking area is increased by more than 50%, so it's not going to be invoked commonly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22317)|
| 6:12:09| Another issue that has come up is that I've heard some people say that the parking ordinance was just passed in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22329)|
| 6:12:17| and we don't want to change it at this point because it's recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22337)|
| 6:12:22| But there have already been changes made in the ordinance, for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22342)|
| 6:12:29| And for the other thing, I've been told by several people that recode itself will be reviewed in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22349)|
| 6:12:40| and the stakeholders committee are going to continue to meet for two years to provide review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22360)|
| 6:12:47| So to say that you don't want to make changes in the parking ordinance because it's two years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22367)|
| 6:12:55| and then to say that you're going to be, or to imply that you're going to be willing to make improvements in recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22375)|
| 6:13:01| after one or two years leaves one with skepticism because you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22381)|
| 6:13:09| go ahead and we can pass recode, we'll make it better later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22389)|
| 6:13:12| but then when the opportunity to make a parking ordinance comes up to make that better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22392)|
| 6:13:18| you're saying it's too new and we don't want to make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22398)|
| 6:13:23| Anyway, we found that forward-looking cities include these standards in their ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22403)|
| 6:13:31| and we think that Knoxville should, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22411)|
| 6:13:33| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22413)|
| 6:13:35| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22415)|
| 6:13:37| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22417)|
| 6:13:41| Thank you very much, and I'll give Ms. Feld some credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22421)|
| 6:13:44| She is coming closer to the way that we're seeing things, so I appreciate her willingness to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22424)|
| 6:13:52| You don't want her to have a bad reputation now, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22432)|
| 6:13:55| No, maybe a couple more cups of coffee with her and we'll see things eye to eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22435)|
| 6:14:02| One thing I want to bring to your attention is, you know, this ordinance is barely a year old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22442)|
| 6:14:08| and council had, I would say, a central focus on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22448)|
| 6:14:13| It was vastly deliberated, and I think a well-thought ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22453)|
| 6:14:20| And this is not an economic thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22460)|
| 6:14:24| and the most consequential part about the parking landscape ordinance has to do with small lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22464)|
| 6:14:31| and it's all about losing function, the use of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22471)|
| 6:14:37| It's not about economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22477)|
| 6:14:39| We comply with landscape ordinances and usually exceed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22479)|
| 6:14:43| but I would say there are other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22483)|
| 6:14:46| This is a landscape bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22486)|
| 6:14:48| You know, we typically use bonds for things that affect the public use here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22488)|
| 6:14:55| Your policy here states that it's basically for streets and drainage and highway entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22495)|
| 6:15:02| so I just want to make that distinction that we're moving into new territory, right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22502)|
| 6:15:08| I just want everyone to be clear that we don't put bonds on mechanical, electrical, plumbing, building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22508)|
| 6:15:15| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22515)|
| 6:15:17| So, you know, we would like to see someone come out and inspect the landscaping just like you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22517)|
| 6:15:23| the electrical, mechanical, or plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22523)|
| 6:15:26| So those would be our recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22526)|
| 6:15:28| but, you know, most of the projects that we're seeing now were done under the old ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22528)|
| 6:15:34| that had virtually no landscape requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22534)|
| 6:15:37| So I would just recommend and suggest and encourage that you give this one-year-old ordinance a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22537)|
| 6:15:43| before we start making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22543)|
| 6:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22545)|
| 6:15:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22546)|
| 6:15:48| Ms. Roche, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22548)|
| 6:15:53| I won't restate anything that Tim already said, but our position on this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22553)|
| 6:15:59| I was on the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22559)|
| 6:16:00| We didn't touch parking, landscaping, signs, or even hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22560)|
| 6:16:04| We worked under the agreement and very public knowledge that these would not be touched in any substantial ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22564)|
| 6:16:11| We have not analyzed the recode design standards with any changes, any substantial changes to landscaping in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22571)|
| 6:16:20| We have no idea if they would work or not, what kind of redevelopment issues that they would bring into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22580)|
| 6:16:26| Without seeing her text, I have no idea if it's better or more landscaping or less or better or worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22586)|
| 6:16:33| or how it would actually be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22593)|
| 6:16:35| Probably require a lot of reanalysis of many lots on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22595)|
| 6:16:41| And, you know, it was very public in the state of purposes that these were not going to be touched substantially in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22601)|
| 6:16:51| recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22611)|
| 6:16:54| Let's look at it with the stakeholder committee after recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22614)|
| 6:16:58| The notice of violation, the bond, I think, ends at two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22618)|
| 6:17:02| So after two years, the public's going to have to complain anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22622)|
| 6:17:05| So the notice of violation is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22625)|
| 6:17:07| There's something that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22627)|
| 6:17:09| So recommend also to give time for developments to come into play under this new ordinance that we've just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22629)|
| 6:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22636)|
| 6:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22637)|
| 6:17:18| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22638)|
| 6:17:19| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22639)|
| 6:17:20| I think that some of this has merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22640)|
| 6:17:22| I think that given the scope that we already have, that we've got enough to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22642)|
| 6:17:28| But I think I don't necessarily like the bond idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22648)|
| 6:17:32| I like the idea of at least having some type of temporary CO being given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22652)|
| 6:17:37| And we talked a little bit about this at the workshop months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22657)|
| 6:17:40| I think it has merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22660)|
| 6:17:41| I think the tree bond or the tree fund has merit as well to be fleshed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22661)|
| 6:17:47| But I think given what's in front of us, I don't think it's the time to bring it up and try to insert it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22667)|
| 6:17:54| But I think it's good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22674)|
| 6:17:56| Yeah, I want to thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22676)|
| 6:17:58| I would just suggest as well that this is something that we should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22678)|
| 6:18:02| And whether it's – I'm not saying – all I can say is after recode passes, there's too much to get into this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22682)|
| 6:18:10| And whether the stakeholder committee takes it up immediately or takes it up later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22690)|
| 6:18:15| I don't have an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22695)|
| 6:18:17| But that it should wait until after because it's significant enough that it will take some time to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22697)|
| 6:18:24| And to – yes, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22704)|
| 6:18:26| Because the committee's not talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22706)|
| 6:18:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22708)|
| 6:18:30| Understand what we're saying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22710)|
| 6:18:32| Landscape bond was actually in the first draft or two of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22712)|
| 6:18:38| So it's not a brand-new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22718)|
| 6:18:40| And I think the city asked for it to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22720)|
| 6:18:44| But it was in there, and I think it was in there because the consultants just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22724)|
| 6:18:50| it's common to have a landscape bond be included as part of the landscape ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22730)|
| 6:18:56| We haven't had a landscape – a whole section of our ordinance devoted to landscaping before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22736)|
| 6:19:02| So it's all new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22742)|
| 6:19:05| It seems to me that this is the time to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22745)|
| 6:19:10| And some of the parking lot – the landscaping issues, they're not new either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22750)|
| 6:19:16| because they are different, but they were discussed when the parking ordinance was being discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22756)|
| 6:19:24| which is 2017, so it's not one year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22764)|
| 6:19:27| It's two years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22767)|
| 6:19:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22769)|
| 6:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22771)|
| 6:19:33| Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22773)|
| 6:19:36| I just want to make a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22776)|
| 6:19:38| Community Forum did discuss these amendments earlier, and we do support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22778)|
| 6:19:44| And I don't mind that more time should be taken to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22784)|
| 6:19:50| but I think we're going to have some more time between now and when recode eventually gets voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22790)|
| 6:19:56| So I would urge you to give at least a little more consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22796)|
| 6:20:00| whether you do all three pieces or just one of the three or two of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22800)|
| 6:20:04| I think it really is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22804)|
| 6:20:05| As many of you know, I have fought many battles in this town about protecting trees and saving trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22805)|
| 6:20:11| and we need to plant more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22811)|
| 6:20:14| We've lost a lot already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22814)|
| 6:20:16| So I think that there are things that can be done that shouldn't be that difficult to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22816)|
| 6:20:21| and I would just hope that in this hiatus period that apparently we're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22821)|
| 6:20:26| that maybe some work could be done to examine this a little more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22826)|
| 6:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22831)|
| 6:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22833)|
| 6:20:36| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22836)|
| 6:20:37| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22837)|
| 6:20:38| Welcome, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22838)|
| 6:20:39| My name is Ray Kircher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22839)|
| 6:20:40| I don't live here, but I do a lot of work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22840)|
| 6:20:42| I'm at 120 LaSalle Road in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22842)|
| 6:20:45| We are a tree city there, and we have a lot of problems with these trees tearing up our sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22845)|
| 6:20:52| tearing up our walkways, our entryways into stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22852)|
| 6:20:56| These trees are not maintained by anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22856)|
| 6:20:58| You're going to put a bond out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22858)|
| 6:21:00| I suggest that this bond cover damage to property that the city taxpayer pays for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22860)|
| 6:21:06| Walking right down through here is a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22866)|
| 6:21:09| What these trees have done to the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22869)|
| 6:21:12| and this City Council wants to add more without some kind of regulation on what this tree does to our walkways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22872)|
| 6:21:20| When I can't even get to City Council meeting without tripping over four or five stones on the way here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22880)|
| 6:21:26| I believe we're just blowing this regulation into the wind because nobody's thinking about us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22886)|
| 6:21:33| We're only thinking about a tree or a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22893)|
| 6:21:36| When I try to get down to the city county building to pull my permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22896)|
| 6:21:42| that pathway on that lower Hill Street is atrocious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22902)|
| 6:21:48| I mean, you've got people out there grinding up the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22908)|
| 6:21:51| What does that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22911)|
| 6:21:53| I would say, sir, that these days we use new technology exactly because of that, the silver cell technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22913)|
| 6:22:00| and also you see with our new streetscapes, we don't plant the trees in the same way that they were planted in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22920)|
| 6:22:07| Well, can this bond take care of some of the issues we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22927)|
| 6:22:12| Or is this whole thing about people who are going to be here 20 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22932)|
| 6:22:17| Because by then we'll have new sidewalks, and then we'll follow the new tree code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22937)|
| 6:22:24| But as far as it is right now, it's very dangerous to walk outside this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22944)|
| 6:22:29| And to come on the front side, which I haven't done in over 20 years since I've moved out of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22949)|
| 6:22:35| because I've always used the Hill Avenue entrance, this is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22955)|
| 6:22:41| And to have more trees to come in and not address this issue out front right now, I'm going to lose more teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22961)|
| 6:22:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22969)|
| 6:22:51| Your address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22971)|
| 6:22:52| Sir, we need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22972)|
| 6:22:56| Ray Kircher, K-I-R-C-H-E-R, 120 LaSalle Road, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22976)|
| 6:23:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22982)|
| 6:23:03| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22983)|
| 6:23:04| Okay, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22984)|
| 6:23:05| Just a quick question, I guess, for Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22985)|
| 6:23:07| Is a tree bank something when I thought I had to put in a percentage of a tree to get a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22987)|
| 6:23:13| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22993)|
| 6:23:14| I said when I thought I had to put in a percentage of a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22994)|
| 6:23:18| It's a long story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22998)|
| 6:23:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=22999)|
| 6:23:20| To get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23000)|
| 6:23:21| Is a tree bank something that you feel like we do not have to determine tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23001)|
| 6:23:25| I'm certainly not prepared to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23005)|
| 6:23:27| But is it something that we could discuss further that we feel like would further and enhance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23007)|
| 6:23:34| I do think it's worth further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23014)|
| 6:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23016)|
| 6:23:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23017)|
| 6:23:38| Well, we can talk about that in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23018)|
| 6:23:40| I love the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23020)|
| 6:23:42| June 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23022)|
| 6:23:44| I was thinking June 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23024)|
| 6:23:48| I may not even be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23028)|
| 6:23:50| How about you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23030)|
| 6:23:51| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23031)|
| 6:23:52| No, we'll look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23032)|
| 6:23:53| Because we work real closely with the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23033)|
| 6:23:55| They're the group that manages the tree ordinance currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23035)|
| 6:24:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23040)|
| 6:24:01| So I think big picture, once we get through this process, we really need to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23041)|
| 6:24:07| how we had the tree protection ordinance when we didn't have landscape requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23047)|
| 6:24:12| So now we've got landscape requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23052)|
| 6:24:14| How are they going to marry together so that we don't have overlapping and or conflicting regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23054)|
| 6:24:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23061)|
| 6:24:22| Only to confuse you as you try and develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23062)|
| 6:24:24| So I do think that it's something that's on our radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23064)|
| 6:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23068)|
| 6:24:30| Honestly, staff, we're waiting to see how this fleshes out before we marry the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23070)|
| 6:24:35| And that's something that we anticipate bringing through the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23075)|
| 6:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23079)|
| 6:24:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23080)|
| 6:24:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23081)|
| 6:24:42| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23082)|
| 6:24:45| Next article is 13, signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23085)|
| 6:24:48| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23088)|
| 6:24:50| What are you on, Carly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23090)|
| 6:24:51| What number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23091)|
| 6:24:53| If I could just ask if we go back to 11 for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23093)|
| 6:24:59| No, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23099)|
| 6:25:00| Only because this has to do with salvage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23100)|
| 6:25:04| When it came up earlier, I was told to wait until we got to section 11, article 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23104)|
| 6:25:11| And I'm sorry, I just missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23111)|
| 6:25:15| But it's where we deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23115)|
| 6:25:17| What page is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23117)|
| 6:25:18| It would be page 11-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23118)|
| 6:25:20| Does counsel want to review this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23120)|
| 6:25:24| Two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23124)|
| 6:25:25| All right, two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23125)|
| 6:25:26| What page number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23126)|
| 6:25:27| It would be 11-12 and section 11-7, addresses access and driveway design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23127)|
| 6:25:33| Page 11-12, 11.7, access and driveway design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23133)|
| 6:25:39| Go ahead, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23139)|
| 6:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23141)|
| 6:25:42| On page 918, I raised the issue of salvage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23142)|
| 6:25:45| And maybe this is speaking for the people who aren't here, because I don't live near a salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23145)|
| 6:25:50| But this one change, which got rid of the requirements that minimize the access, visual and vehicular access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23150)|
| 6:26:04| into salvage yards and moved those access requirements to article 11, treating them like everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23164)|
| 6:26:14| undoes a real protection of neighborhoods that do have salvage yards in their mists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23174)|
| 6:26:21| Salvage yards were treated differently in the article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23181)|
| 6:26:25| because they require opaque fencing to screen the interior from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23185)|
| 6:26:32| So therefore, they have opaque fencing except for ingress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23192)|
| 6:26:37| They minimize the ingress and egress, so everyone couldn't see into the lovely interior of the salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23197)|
| 6:26:45| When those provisions were removed and the salvage yard ingress and egress is treated like entering any other property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23205)|
| 6:26:54| you have removed the protection from those neighborhoods, the visual protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23214)|
| 6:26:59| So I would just ask that you consider putting back in the ingress and egress limitations for the salvage yards in the earlier article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23219)|
| 6:27:11| Again, I don't live near a salvage yard, but I think we need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23231)|
| 6:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23239)|
| 6:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23241)|
| 6:27:23| We'll move on then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23243)|
| 6:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23245)|
| 6:27:26| So we are on article 13, which is signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23246)|
| 6:27:33| Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23253)|
| 6:27:34| Significant changes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23254)|
| 6:27:35| This article, the sign ordinance, was incorporated in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23255)|
| 6:27:39| The zoning designations were changed to match the new zoning designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23259)|
| 6:27:45| In this draft, there was some clarification of sidewalk signs where they're permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23265)|
| 6:27:52| which would be downtown district and then planned developments is approved as part of the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23272)|
| 6:27:57| clarifying that home occupations are limited to one wall sign, which is the current regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23277)|
| 6:28:03| and adding the institutional district, which is a newer district that we had left out of the previous draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23283)|
| 6:28:12| Standards for sign construction are clarified in the final section, section 1310 on pages 13 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23292)|
| 6:28:21| Basically, no significant changes in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23301)|
| 6:28:24| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23304)|
| 6:28:26| Any discussion by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23306)|
| 6:28:31| We can move on then to 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23311)|
| 6:28:34| Ms. Malone, you have something on 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23314)|
| 6:28:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23316)|
| 6:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23317)|
| 6:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23318)|
| 6:28:40| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23320)|
| 6:28:42| Page 13-15, 3.9, signs for specific districts, D, residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23322)|
| 6:28:50| It lists E-N, R-N-1, R-N-2, R-N-3, R-N-4, R-N-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23330)|
| 6:28:55| What about R-N-6 and R-N-7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23335)|
| 6:28:57| Were they omitted on purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23337)|
| 6:29:03| Mr. Green, are you aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23343)|
| 6:29:05| Page 13-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23345)|
| 6:29:07| I'm going to blame this one on the consultants and say we probably should have R-N-6 and R-N-7 there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23347)|
| 6:29:13| and I would make that request that council add them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23353)|
| 6:29:17| I make a motion to add R-N-6, R-N-7 to D-1, the heading of D, in section 13.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23357)|
| 6:29:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23367)|
| 6:29:30| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23370)|
| 6:29:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23372)|
| 6:29:34| On page 13-15, part C there of section 13.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23374)|
| 6:29:45| detached signs aren't allowed in residential overlay districts, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23385)|
| 6:29:52| I'm lost here. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23392)|
| 6:29:55| 13.9C as in Charlie, part one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23395)|
| 6:30:00| In the H overlay district, one information sign, detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23400)|
| 6:30:08| Doesn't that, as written, apply to a residentially zoned area where a detached sign, I don't believe, should be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23408)|
| 6:30:18| In the residentially zoned areas, if you're in the overlay, wouldn't you only be permitted to have, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23418)|
| 6:30:25| a one-by-one sign for a bed and breakfast, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23425)|
| 6:30:35| One thing, and I'm not very familiar with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23435)|
| 6:30:39| I know some of Market Square is a historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23439)|
| 6:30:45| I'm not talking about commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23445)|
| 6:30:48| I'm just saying the way this is written, it includes in historic overlay districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23448)|
| 6:30:56| and you have H-1 overlays in residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23456)|
| 6:31:01| and it would allow looking at a detached sign with a maximum sign area of up to nine square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23461)|
| 6:31:09| and a maximum height of eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23469)|
| 6:31:12| I'm not sure that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23472)|
| 6:31:15| And again, I'm not familiar with the current sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23475)|
| 6:31:19| so I believe this was brought in and it's the way it currently is, so I'm going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23479)|
| 6:31:31| Page 13-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23491)|
| 6:31:34| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23494)|
| 6:31:36| Section 13-9-C, H, Historic Overlay Zoning Districts, number one, C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23496)|
| 6:31:46| At the very top, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23506)|
| 6:31:48| delineates the signs available in specific districts and the standards for such signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23508)|
| 6:31:53| and then it gets to Historic Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23513)|
| 6:31:57| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23517)|
| 6:32:00| So I'm going to read from the current...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23520)|
| 6:32:03| Sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23523)|
| 6:32:04| Sign portion of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23524)|
| 6:32:07| It's Article 5, Section 11.3, Historic Overlay Zone Districts, Part A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23527)|
| 6:32:14| In H-1 districts, one informational sign detached or attached to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23534)|
| 6:32:19| shall be permitted in connection with the use of the lot with a maximum sign area of nine square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23539)|
| 6:32:24| and a maximum height of eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23544)|
| 6:32:26| So it's exactly the same as current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23546)|
| 6:32:28| That's what we've got today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23548)|
| 6:32:30| But you're not allowing that in a residentially zoned area with an H-1 overlay, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23550)|
| 6:32:38| Can we just have him research this afterwards and come back to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23558)|
| 6:32:42| I would assume that Section D here, those sign standards override with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23562)|
| 6:32:50| Fortunately, I don't administer the sign ordinance, so I can say anything I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23570)|
| 6:32:55| Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23575)|
| 6:32:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23576)|
| 6:32:57| Could we look at for future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23577)|
| 6:32:59| We don't have to beat it to death tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23579)|
| 6:33:01| but is it possible that it needs an amendment there that says on C, as in Charlie, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23581)|
| 6:33:11| it says its thing there just as it does, and then it just needs to be edited to additionally say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23591)|
| 6:33:18| except in residential zone C, Section D1 below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23598)|
| 6:33:24| Would that fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23604)|
| 6:33:26| So that distinguishes between things that are H-1 historic overlay that are downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23606)|
| 6:33:36| We can look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23616)|
| 6:33:38| I'm not sure we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23618)|
| 6:33:40| As we enforce this, we don't pick one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23620)|
| 6:33:43| One both apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23623)|
| 6:33:45| If it's in a residential district and it's got a historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23625)|
| 6:33:50| we're going to use both sets of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23630)|
| 6:33:53| I think in some of the general rules of interpretation that the most restrictive standards apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23633)|
| 6:34:02| I think we make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23642)|
| 6:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23643)|
| 6:34:05| So what are we saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23645)|
| 6:34:06| We do need to review it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23646)|
| 6:34:07| Peter thinks we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23647)|
| 6:34:08| We'll review it, but I don't think it's going to need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23648)|
| 6:34:12| There's all sorts of regulations throughout this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23652)|
| 6:34:16| We've got the base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23656)|
| 6:34:18| We've got the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23658)|
| 6:34:19| We've got design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23659)|
| 6:34:21| So we marry all three of those at various times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23661)|
| 6:34:28| But we'll be happy to reevaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23668)|
| 6:34:33| You need a vote on RN-6 and RN-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23673)|
| 6:34:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23676)|
| 6:34:38| Because we made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23678)|
| 6:34:39| Somebody seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23679)|
| 6:34:40| And then somebody started talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23680)|
| 6:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23681)|
| 6:34:42| And so I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23682)|
| 6:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23685)|
| 6:34:46| We are on page 13-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23686)|
| 6:34:48| 13.9, signs permitted in specific districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23688)|
| 6:34:51| D, residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23691)|
| 6:34:53| And we're adding RN-6 and RN-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23693)|
| 6:34:55| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23695)|
| 6:34:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23697)|
| 6:34:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23698)|
| 6:34:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23699)|
| 6:35:00| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23700)|
| 6:35:02| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23702)|
| 6:35:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23703)|
| 6:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23704)|
| 6:35:05| Just 13-15 D-1A for properly approved home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23705)|
| 6:35:13| Are we doing an approval process for home occupations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23713)|
| 6:35:17| Should it just be right now home occupations are approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23717)|
| 6:35:23| They're used on review now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23723)|
| 6:35:26| And they would be a permitted use subject to certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23726)|
| 6:35:30| So they would still have to be approved in this case just as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23730)|
| 6:35:34| administrative approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23734)|
| 6:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23737)|
| 6:35:38| Could we maybe just say for approved home occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23738)|
| 6:35:42| do we need to say properly approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23742)|
| 6:35:44| Whichever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23744)|
| 6:35:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23747)|
| 6:35:48| We're going to leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23748)|
| 6:35:49| Are you deleting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23749)|
| 6:35:52| No, I'm not saying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23752)|
| 6:35:54| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23754)|
| 6:35:55| We didn't touch the sign portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23755)|
| 6:35:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23757)|
| 6:35:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23758)|
| 6:35:59| I didn't know if that applied anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23759)|
| 6:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23761)|
| 6:36:02| Anything more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23762)|
| 6:36:05| No, I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23765)|
| 6:36:07| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23767)|
| 6:36:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23771)|
| 6:36:14| One of the changes that did take place is there was a new zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23774)|
| 6:36:18| called institutional that didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23778)|
| 6:36:21| So in the earlier draft, signs for the institutional zone were not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23781)|
| 6:36:29| So that was in draft four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23789)|
| 6:36:32| So there was no regulation of those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23792)|
| 6:36:37| So this draft five has regulations for signs in institutional zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23797)|
| 6:36:44| Unfortunately, I think if you look at what are institutional zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23804)|
| 6:36:50| they are middle private schools, public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23810)|
| 6:36:53| and even though the public schools don't have to follow the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23813)|
| 6:36:56| do we really, they're health care facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23816)|
| 6:37:00| do we really want them to follow the regulations of the commercials sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23820)|
| 6:37:04| ordinance as opposed to the office or office park sign ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23824)|
| 6:37:09| In other words, if somebody has a private school facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23829)|
| 6:37:15| and around residential properties or, for that matter, a public school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23835)|
| 6:37:19| where I think most public schools try to go along with the general belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23839)|
| 6:37:26| or guidelines or laws of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23846)|
| 6:37:30| do you really want them to have the kinds of signs that are permitted in commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23850)|
| 6:37:35| as opposed to office zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23855)|
| 6:37:37| And right now, since institutional has been put in the commercial category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23857)|
| 6:37:44| and industrial category, that's what you'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23864)|
| 6:37:47| So I would ask that institutional zone be looked at for those signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23867)|
| 6:37:51| for this new zone, to be more appropriately placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23871)|
| 6:37:55| since they are not necessarily next to, facing, or alongside commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23875)|
| 6:38:03| They tend to be in neighborhoods, residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23883)|
| 6:38:08| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23888)|
| 6:38:10| So any discussion from council on that, or are we moving on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23890)|
| 6:38:20| Okay, we're on 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23900)|
| 6:38:23| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23903)|
| 6:38:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23905)|
| 6:38:27| On page 14-5, it's going to be section 14.3B, terms and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23907)|
| 6:38:35| Hold on, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23915)|
| 6:38:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23916)|
| 6:38:37| 14-5, 4.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23917)|
| 6:38:39| 14.13, Historic Zoning Commission Organization, Part B, terms and renewals for members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23919)|
| 6:38:48| There's no discussion at all for terms and renewals for members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23928)|
| 6:38:55| And the same thing happens on the very next page under the Infill Housing Review Committee organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23935)|
| 6:39:02| Perhaps I'd suggest we maybe just take our current language and transpose it there if that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23942)|
| 6:39:09| I believe we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23949)|
| 6:39:11| The Infill Housing Committee is actually staff, and there's no term limit on infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23951)|
| 6:39:17| And I don't think there's a term limit other than in the rules of procedure for the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23957)|
| 6:39:27| I know there's not one for the infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23967)|
| 6:39:30| There are term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23970)|
| 6:39:32| Well, there are terms for members of the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23972)|
| 6:39:35| Yes, there are terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23975)|
| 6:39:36| What is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23976)|
| 6:39:37| We can review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23977)|
| 6:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23979)|
| 6:39:50| You mean the length of the term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23990)|
| 6:39:52| Well, it's entitled Terms and Renewal for Members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23992)|
| 6:39:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23995)|
| 6:39:56| But either the terms are missing or the caption is a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=23996)|
| 6:40:02| It just has who the members are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24002)|
| 6:40:04| Oh, and not the terms, how you term it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24004)|
| 6:40:07| How does that have to do with terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24007)|
| 6:40:08| It looks as though that may have been left out by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24008)|
| 6:40:10| It is in the current code and specifies that each term is five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24010)|
| 6:40:17| And then it discusses staggering those terms and renewals and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24017)|
| 6:40:21| We can look at adding the current code language back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24021)|
| 6:40:26| I make a motion that you look at that and add it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24026)|
| 6:40:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24029)|
| 6:40:30| I make a motion to add the current language back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24030)|
| 6:40:36| Well, I don't know if you need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24036)|
| 6:40:38| I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24038)|
| 6:40:39| So, basically, we will bring it back incorporating the current language, right, as appropriate for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24039)|
| 6:40:45| For a future vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24045)|
| 6:40:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24047)|
| 6:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24048)|
| 6:40:50| I mean, do you all just want to accept the current language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24050)|
| 6:40:53| or you want it to be brought back to look at and vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24053)|
| 6:40:56| The section was left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24056)|
| 6:40:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24058)|
| 6:40:59| And we just need to put that section back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24059)|
| 6:41:00| Yes, put it back in if it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24060)|
| 6:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24063)|

| 6:41:23| For Historic Zoning Commission and Infill Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24083)|

| 6:41:28| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24088)|
| 6:41:29| If it applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24089)|
| 6:41:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24090)|

| 6:41:42| What else on 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24102)|
| 6:41:48| Anything else on 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24108)|
| 6:41:51| Yeah, just 14.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24111)|
| 6:41:55| It's hard to read on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24115)|
| 6:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24117)|
| 6:41:58| 14-3, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24118)|
| 6:42:00| Page 14-3, Section 14.8, Administrative Review Committee Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24120)|
| 6:42:06| To make recommendations on alternative landscape design per Section 12.2.D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24126)|
| 6:42:15| which is in another earlier section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24135)|
| 6:42:17| Just one section talks about the Administrative Review Committee approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24137)|
| 6:42:23| And then the other section talks about reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24143)|
| 6:42:30| Or making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24150)|
| 6:42:32| So I think there's just some language that needs to be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24152)|
| 6:42:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24156)|
| 6:42:37| So Section 14.8 here says to make recommendations on site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24157)|
| 6:42:42| But then if you go back to 12.2, I think it says it approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24162)|
| 6:42:47| So I think the question is, which does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24167)|
| 6:42:51| It should be in 12.2.D, make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24171)|
| 6:42:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24175)|
| 6:42:59| You're saying 12.2.D should say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24179)|
| 6:43:02| Recommendations, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24182)|
| 6:43:03| You're saying, so 14.8 needs to, oh, I'm sorry, 12.2.D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24183)|
| 6:43:15| Page 12.2 should be clarified to recommendations, not approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24195)|
| 6:43:21| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24201)|
| 6:43:23| Recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24203)|
| 6:43:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24204)|
| 6:43:25| And where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24205)|
| 6:43:26| 12.2.D on page 12-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24206)|
| 6:43:30| And Section D, it reads, the alternative landscape must be submitted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24210)|
| 6:43:35| and approved by the Administrative Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24215)|
| 6:43:39| and approving the alternative landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24219)|
| 6:43:41| the Administrative Review Committee must find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24221)|
| 6:43:44| I don't see where you're reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24224)|
| 6:43:47| It's under Part D-2, and it's in the last two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24227)|
| 6:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24233)|
| 6:43:54| The alternative landscape plan must be submitted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24234)|
| 6:43:57| and approved by the Administrative Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24237)|
| 6:43:59| And reviewed, it should be submitted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24239)|
| 6:44:02| and reviewed by the Administrative Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24242)|
| 6:44:05| And making a recommendation regarding the alternative landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24245)|
| 6:44:13| the Administrative Review Committee must find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24253)|
| 6:44:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24263)|
| 6:44:24| So we want a motion to amend this to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24264)|
| 6:44:28| So a motion to amend Page 12-2, Section 12.2.D-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24268)|
| 6:44:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24280)|
| 6:44:41| It's really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24281)|
| 6:44:42| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24282)|
| 6:44:43| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24283)|
| 6:44:44| I'm going to get back to the right page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24284)|
| 6:44:46| Section D-2, strike the word in the 1, 2, 3, 4, 4th line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24286)|
| 6:44:51| strike the word approved and swap it out with the word reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24291)|
| 6:44:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24296)|

| 6:45:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24301)|
| 6:45:02| And then also in making a recommendation regarding, let's do it all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24302)|
| 6:45:08| In approving, making a, in approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24308)|

| 6:45:16| And then the next sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24316)|
| 6:45:17| in making a recommendation as opposed to in approving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24317)|
| 6:45:21| in making a recommendation regarding the alternative landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24321)|
| 6:45:26| The ARC must find that, A, B, C, D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24326)|
| 6:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24329)|
| 6:45:30| Do you have that, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24330)|

| 6:45:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24334)|
| 6:45:35| So that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24335)|
| 6:45:36| That is the motion to amend that as stated and written up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24336)|
| 6:45:40| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24340)|

| 6:45:58| We are almost through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24358)|
| 6:46:00| We're almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24360)|
| 6:46:01| We haven't reached the threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24361)|
| 6:46:02| We're on page 3 of 7 of our amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24362)|
| 6:46:05| I know, but a lot of these are very minor ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24365)|
| 6:46:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24367)|
| 6:46:09| We're getting to some sections that are pretty complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24369)|
| 6:46:13| They do a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24373)|
| 6:46:15| I mean, I don't know if there's an option to move it to a regular scheduled council meeting in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24375)|
| 6:46:21| I mean, can we move it to the Tuesday meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24381)|
| 6:46:24| I mean, I'm just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24384)|
| 6:46:26| We have told people that, we've already stated it several times, that June, because of scheduled conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24386)|
| 6:46:32| people are going to not be at meetings and some meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24392)|
| 6:46:35| I mean, that's up to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24395)|
| 6:46:37| You were saying tack it on to our next regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24397)|
| 6:46:40| Right, the meeting on Tuesday, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24400)|
| 6:46:42| That's up to your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24402)|
| 6:46:43| It's too late for that, the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24403)|
| 6:46:45| Well, you could add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24405)|
| 6:46:46| You can't public notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24406)|
| 6:46:47| We could put it on by emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24407)|
| 6:46:49| Yeah, but we're sending back to a planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24409)|
| 6:46:52| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24412)|

| 6:46:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24417)|
| 6:46:58| But I think we've just got to power through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24418)|
| 6:47:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24420)|

| 6:47:05| If I could just ask about the Administrative Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24425)|
| 6:47:12| My understanding at present, it is not necessarily open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24432)|
| 6:47:19| It doesn't keep minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24439)|
| 6:47:21| It doesn't come under the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24441)|
| 6:47:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24443)|
| 6:47:29| Which is kind of interesting if they're going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24449)|
| 6:47:32| depending on the powers that they are given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24452)|
| 6:47:41| So will the public have any ability to address the arc that's now going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24461)|
| 6:47:51| Remember, Administrative Review Committee was just the two form-based zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24471)|
| 6:47:56| This is expanding it out of South Waterfront and Cumberland to broader things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24476)|
| 6:48:07| Can it continue to operate as it does with no notice, no Sunshine Law requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24487)|
| 6:48:15| no minutes, no public notice, no public participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24495)|
| 6:48:21| Here come recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24501)|
| 6:48:23| I think it's something you need to seriously consider as you expand its authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24503)|
| 6:48:30| You need to look at what its role is regarding the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24510)|
| 6:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24515)|
| 6:48:36| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24516)|
| 6:48:37| If I could just respond to that for one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24517)|
| 6:48:41| With Council's catch regarding the approval process for the ARC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24521)|
| 6:48:46| and changing that back to making recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24526)|
| 6:48:49| that was our intent as a whole was that that committee would be advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24529)|
| 6:48:54| and making recommendations only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24534)|
| 6:48:57| In making those recommendations in a public process where the public could still, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24537)|
| 6:49:02| comment and give their feedback, that was not anything we were trying to overstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24542)|
| 6:49:09| Well, can we do something that helps have further review and transparency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24549)|
| 6:49:19| How will the public know that you're even reviewing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24559)|
| 6:49:22| Or what if it's a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24562)|
| 6:49:25| It's a recommendation to the Zoning Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24565)|
| 6:49:28| The Zoning Administrator can take that recommendation and move forward with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24568)|
| 6:49:34| or toss it in the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24574)|
| 6:49:38| The decisions that the Zoning Administrator makes are appealable to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24578)|
| 6:49:47| So eventually it will come to the public view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24587)|
| 6:49:50| It's not just decisions made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24590)|
| 6:49:53| As any other decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24593)|
| 6:49:55| The additional power granted to the ARC is to make recommendations on alternative landscape plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24595)|
| 6:50:03| which may be a once-a-year occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24603)|
| 6:50:07| I was in a community that had the provision for alternative landscape compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24607)|
| 6:50:11| and we had maybe one a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24611)|
| 6:50:14| Maybe Knoxville will get two a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24614)|
| 6:50:17| We hope people become more inventive with landscape plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24617)|
| 6:50:20| But, again, they make recommendations only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24620)|
| 6:50:23| Their powers are not being broadly expanded to make major decisions under this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24623)|
| 6:50:30| And I would like to propose that this is not something that's going to change this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24630)|
| 6:50:36| So if you want to add that to future discussions, please, on the whole issue that's been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24636)|
| 6:50:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24642)|
| 6:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24643)|
| 6:50:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24644)|
| 6:50:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24645)|
| 6:50:46| What else on 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24646)|
| 6:50:50| Anything else on 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24650)|
| 6:50:53| Yes, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24653)|
| 6:50:54| So earlier in the night we made a clarification back on the temporary uses and the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24654)|
| 6:51:00| We need to update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24660)|
| 6:51:02| We need to move section 14.8C, which is on page 14-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24662)|
| 6:51:13| That's the only thing we were just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24673)|
| 6:51:15| We need to move that to 14.4F to be consistent with section 9.4G and H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24675)|
| 6:51:42| Those were the changes that council made earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24702)|
| 6:51:45| I move to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24705)|
| 6:51:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24707)|
| 6:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24708)|
| 6:51:49| You all are clear with what is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24709)|
| 6:51:52| Moving 14.8C to 14.4F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24712)|
| 6:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24722)|
| 6:52:03| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24723)|
| 6:52:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24724)|
| 6:52:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24725)|
| 6:52:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24726)|
| 6:52:07| That has been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24727)|
| 6:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24728)|
| 6:52:09| That has been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24729)|
| 6:52:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24731)|
| 6:52:12| Anything else on 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24732)|
| 6:52:15| We are now on 15, which is the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24735)|
| 6:52:21| Quickly, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24741)|
| 6:52:22| The most significant change in this is section 15.3 on page 15.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24742)|
| 6:52:28| Please pull the mic closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24748)|
| 6:52:33| Maybe I'm just hard of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24753)|
| 6:52:36| I think the mic needs to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24756)|
| 6:52:38| I don't sit like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24758)|
| 6:52:40| I'm going to ask for a longer mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24760)|
| 6:52:42| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24762)|
| 6:52:43| Get a mic for Peter and a longer one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24763)|
| 6:52:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24765)|
| 6:52:46| I've got to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24766)|
| 6:52:47| It's with 15.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24767)|
| 6:52:49| Actually, Christina can speak much more intelligently to this than I can, as she can with most things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24769)|
| 6:52:56| This was taking the vesting statutes from the state and the city's current language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24776)|
| 6:53:03| as opposed to any new language in clarifying vesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24783)|
| 6:53:08| and making sure the vesting standards in this ordinance were compatible with the state's legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24788)|
| 6:53:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24797)|
| 6:53:18| The main changes that we have between the December draft and the one before you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24798)|
| 6:53:22| and I apologize, my fingers are not keeping up with our speed here tonight, which is probably a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24802)|
| 6:53:29| The changes, they look scary because we have a lot crossed out and a lot added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24809)|
| 6:53:34| but really these changes came about after I had a meeting with Peter Ahrens and his staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24814)|
| 6:53:40| where it became quite clear that state laws, definitions, and terminologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24820)|
| 6:53:45| didn't quite match the terminology that we here at the city use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24825)|
| 6:53:49| What we have done is we've incorporated state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24829)|
| 6:53:51| but using the terminology that we use on a local level to avoid confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24831)|
| 6:53:56| Okay, and that's all the blue on 15-4 and 15-5, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24836)|
| 6:54:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24842)|
| 6:54:03| That's basically what's in there, but using the new terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24843)|
| 6:54:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24846)|
| 6:54:07| Our local terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24847)|
| 6:54:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24849)|
| 6:54:10| Based on state law requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24850)|
| 6:54:12| Council, have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24852)|
| 6:54:15| Do you want to speak to that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24855)|
| 6:54:17| To 15-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24857)|
| 6:54:21| Age or section number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24861)|
| 6:54:22| Oh, right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24862)|
| 6:54:24| Yes, you're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24864)|
| 6:54:26| All right, good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24866)|
| 6:54:28| Go ahead and make your statement, sir, please, for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24868)|
| 6:54:31| Michael Stinson, 1401 Cuesta Circle, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24871)|
| 6:54:35| And from what I was understanding earlier, I was told that it's actually 15-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24875)|
| 6:54:41| I believe I was actually told by the young woman with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24881)|
| 6:54:45| that it actually references a grandfather clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24885)|
| 6:54:50| No, not quite what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24890)|
| 6:54:52| Article 15.3 is about vesting rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24892)|
| 6:54:55| and what that means is that based on when a permit or an approval is sought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24895)|
| 6:55:00| relative to when the new code would become effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24900)|
| 6:55:03| that may freeze development standards for that particular time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24903)|
| 6:55:08| So if you were to file for a permit before recode went into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24908)|
| 6:55:12| then you would stay under the current code in most instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24912)|
| 6:55:16| The grandfathering in is going to come into play in Article 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24916)|
| 6:55:19| based on nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24919)|
| 6:55:21| So there is nothing pertaining to protecting property with nonconforming status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24921)|
| 6:55:27| or anything like that within the guidelines of 15-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24927)|
| 6:55:31| That is in mostly Article 17, but, again, Article 15.3 is going to provide protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24931)|
| 6:55:37| in the event that anybody requests a permit or approval on, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24937)|
| 6:55:41| a preliminary development plan before recode goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24941)|
| 6:55:45| So, yes, they both contain protections, but they are slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24945)|
| 6:55:50| Okay, because with that being the case, what I'm trying to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24950)|
| 6:55:54| because my number one issue is that I have scavenged all of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24954)|
| 6:55:59| and I cannot find the terminology anywhere for grandfather clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24959)|
| 6:56:03| We actually use that terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24963)|
| 6:56:05| Don't use that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24965)|
| 6:56:07| Okay, so there's a different terminology used for grandfathering, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24967)|
| 6:56:11| State law doesn't use grandfathering in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24971)|
| 6:56:14| They use the phrases nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24974)|
| 6:56:17| and that's what we have in our current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24977)|
| 6:56:19| So, sir, what I'd like to ask is that if you could schedule a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24979)|
| 6:56:24| to call them on the phone or whatever or visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24984)|
| 6:56:27| and they can really explain that more thoroughly to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24987)|
| 6:56:30| Well, because the reason I'm here is because I think that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24990)|
| 6:56:34| is equally obligated to hearing the answer as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24994)|
| 6:56:38| because what I just heard is that the verbiage is totally different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=24998)|
| 6:56:42| so it's okay if I'm told in privacy, but our community doesn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25002)|
| 6:56:47| Because what I'm hearing is a grandfather clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25007)|
| 6:56:50| I go into this, and I do not see grandfather clause anywhere in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25010)|
| 6:56:55| Because that's not a legal word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25015)|
| 6:56:56| That's layman's terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25016)|
| 6:56:57| That's layman's terms, and there's another way that, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25017)|
| 6:57:01| you are grandfathered in, but it's called directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25021)|
| 6:57:04| Nonconforming structures and uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25024)|
| 6:57:06| Yeah, it's the second paragraph on 17-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25026)|
| 6:57:10| a nonconforming building structure use of land lawfully existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25030)|
| 6:57:13| at the time of the adoption or amendment of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25033)|
| 6:57:16| may be continued and maintained as provided in this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25036)|
| 6:57:19| That's the section that does the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25039)|
| 6:57:23| If you're existing in legal at the time of the adoption of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25043)|
| 6:57:27| you are grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25047)|
| 6:57:29| There it is right there in print in 17-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25049)|
| 6:57:32| No one's tried to hide anything on grandfathering in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25052)|
| 6:57:36| Okay, since we are actually at 17-1, I would like to direct you to letter E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25056)|
| 6:57:40| nonconforming uses of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25060)|
| 6:57:43| Number one, a nonconforming use of, well, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25063)|
| 6:57:46| that was not something that was really that important for me to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25066)|
| 6:57:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25070)|
| 6:57:51| I thought it was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25071)|
| 6:57:53| Now, when it comes down to, I guess since it is not a law term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25073)|
| 6:57:59| when it comes down to the grandfathering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25079)|
| 6:58:01| how long does this actually last for properties as well as businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25081)|
| 6:58:08| As long as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25088)|
| 6:58:10| Under state law, as long as the use continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25090)|
| 6:58:12| unless it's discontinued for six consecutive months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25092)|
| 6:58:16| Okay, so if you actually have a rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25096)|
| 6:58:19| and it is nonconforming based on the new codes and people move out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25099)|
| 6:58:24| you take six months to go ahead and try to make it look better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25104)|
| 6:58:28| do some interior work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25108)|
| 6:58:30| Now that it's been empty for six months, it's no longer conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25110)|
| 6:58:33| and it will not be grandfathered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25113)|
| 6:58:35| No, that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25115)|
| 6:58:37| The way the law works is if you have rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25117)|
| 6:58:40| and you're using it as rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25120)|
| 6:58:42| it's being used as residential rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25122)|
| 6:58:45| as long as you continue the process of attempting to rent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25125)|
| 6:58:49| Now, if it gets empty and you don't ever try to rent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25129)|
| 6:58:52| and it's not being used as a residential purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25132)|
| 6:58:55| and it's a nonconforming use, then you will lapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25135)|
| 6:58:59| and you will not be entitled to use it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25139)|
| 6:59:01| But as long as you're using it as rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25141)|
| 6:59:04| it includes the process of rehabbing and renting again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25144)|
| 6:59:08| All of that will toll your six-month lapse statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25148)|
| 6:59:13| Okay, so because it's just where I was reading the verbiage of six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25153)|
| 6:59:18| that if it's not occupied for six months or longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25158)|
| 6:59:21| that it would no longer be conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25161)|
| 6:59:24| It's not occupied for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25164)|
| 6:59:26| It's not being used in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25166)|
| 6:59:28| And being used in that way includes the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25168)|
| 6:59:32| of what you do in utilizing rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25172)|
| 6:59:35| And when you're utilizing rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25175)|
| 6:59:37| that includes the efforts to rent it out, all the things that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25177)|
| 6:59:42| It's just if you abandon it for six months and don't do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25182)|
| 6:59:46| you don't try to rent it out, you don't rehab it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25186)|
| 6:59:48| you don't do anything with it for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25188)|
| 6:59:50| then you're going to lapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25190)|
| 6:59:52| and you're going to have to comply with the current zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25192)|
| 6:59:54| Okay, as long as there is the labor that's going into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25194)|
| 6:59:58| regardless if someone's there, you're still covered, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25198)|
| 7:00:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25200)|
| 7:00:01| Okay, well, that actually does make some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25201)|
| 7:00:04| And right now, since I'm still kind of curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25204)|
| 7:00:10| when we're looking at actually voting on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25210)|
| 7:00:14| for the entire process of recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25214)|
| 7:00:17| because it looks like there's been some great evolvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25217)|
| 7:00:21| over the course of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25221)|
| 7:00:22| but I still think there's some things that need to be looked at further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25222)|
| 7:00:27| And I was just trying to figure out when we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25227)|
| 7:00:29| actually having an official vote on recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25229)|
| 7:00:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25232)|
| 7:00:33| What I said at the beginning of the meeting was that there will be no official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25233)|
| 7:00:36| – I mean, there will not be a final vote on this, the first reading today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25236)|
| 7:00:40| There will be nothing at the earliest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25240)|
| 7:00:43| We would have more voting in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25243)|
| 7:00:45| but we still have to deal with the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25245)|
| 7:00:49| So our next meeting where this might be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25249)|
| 7:00:53| and, again, we have to kind of get together after tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25253)|
| 7:00:57| and see how many things we have to come back to council with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25257)|
| 7:01:00| but it's possible that there will be some elements of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25260)|
| 7:01:05| on the council agenda on July 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25265)|
| 7:01:10| So that's like seven weeks maybe, six weeks, seven weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25270)|
| 7:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25273)|
| 7:01:14| Would be the earliest that we would take this up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25274)|
| 7:01:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25277)|
| 7:01:18| And so what I announced, I don't know if you were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25278)|
| 7:01:20| but July 16th and 30th are two regularly scheduled council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25280)|
| 7:01:24| where something related to this could be on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25284)|
| 7:01:27| and then after that we have August 5th and August 12th at 3 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25287)|
| 7:01:33| which are Mondays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25293)|
| 7:01:35| and all of us are holding those dates for potential meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25295)|
| 7:01:41| Okay, wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25301)|
| 7:01:42| And so will that actually be posted on the website as well with the event calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25302)|
| 7:01:46| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25306)|
| 7:01:47| Okay, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25307)|
| 7:01:48| So with 15-3, is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25308)|
| 7:01:51| because one thing that I was seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25311)|
| 7:01:53| it looks like it was talking about subsection 13.4.310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25313)|
| 7:01:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25319)|
| 7:02:00| That's the state law, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25320)|
| 7:02:02| Okay, so it's state law then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25322)|
| 7:02:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25324)|
| 7:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25325)|
| 7:02:06| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25326)|
| 7:02:07| State law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25327)|
| 7:02:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25328)|
| 7:02:09| Yeah, we're required to implement provisions like these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25329)|
| 7:02:11| and what we have done, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25331)|
| 7:02:13| is we have used our local terminology to make it more user-friendly and readable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25333)|
| 7:02:17| Okay, because that's where I got lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25337)|
| 7:02:21| It took me a minute to even understand what subsection actually was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25341)|
| 7:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25345)|
| 7:02:26| Can I just say –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25346)|
| 7:02:27| We're all learning a lot in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25347)|
| 7:02:29| Someone watching on TV told me there's no sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25349)|
| 7:02:32| I don't know if we have any way to yell at the person at CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25352)|
| 7:02:36| There's no sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25356)|
| 7:02:37| CTV, can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25357)|
| 7:02:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25359)|
| 7:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25360)|
| 7:02:41| Is it something that got fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25361)|
| 7:02:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25363)|
| 7:02:44| He at least knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25364)|
| 7:02:45| The people viewing from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25365)|
| 7:02:47| someone said they were watching and the sound went out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25367)|
| 7:02:49| so I just wanted to tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25369)|
| 7:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25371)|
| 7:02:52| He knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25372)|
| 7:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25373)|
| 7:02:54| Bless him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25374)|
| 7:02:57| Tell them to go to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25377)|
| 7:02:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25378)|
| 7:02:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25379)|
| 7:03:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25380)|
| 7:03:01| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25381)|
| 7:03:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25383)|
| 7:03:04| Anything else on Article 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25384)|
| 7:03:06| Mayor, I would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25386)|
| 7:03:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25388)|
| 7:03:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25389)|
| 7:03:10| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25390)|
| 7:03:11| I would like to just make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25391)|
| 7:03:13| A microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25393)|
| 7:03:14| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25394)|
| 7:03:17| I wanted to make a comment and ask Gerald a couple questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25397)|
| 7:03:19| about what Mr. Stinson brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25399)|
| 7:03:22| and then also I've been getting texts during the meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25402)|
| 7:03:26| When he was asking about if the property that he has gets rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25406)|
| 7:03:31| will he still be able to use it for the same purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25411)|
| 7:03:33| and it seems like a lot of people are thinking that we're changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25413)|
| 7:03:38| a lot of properties from residential to commercial suddenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25418)|
| 7:03:42| and that they'll be paying more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25422)|
| 7:03:45| There's been this statement made that all 74,000 parcels are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25425)|
| 7:03:50| So I think people are worried that their land, their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25430)|
| 7:03:55| is going to be rezoned and change their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25435)|
| 7:04:00| And I wonder if you could just talk on that for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25440)|
| 7:04:02| We're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25442)|
| 7:04:03| Actually, one of my staff finished our analysis of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25443)|
| 7:04:08| and the changes in zoning designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25448)|
| 7:04:13| We're still manipulating that some to make sure it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25453)|
| 7:04:16| The major change was actually from industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25456)|
| 7:04:20| The most acreage was from industrial to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25460)|
| 7:04:23| to accommodate properties like the neighborhood west of Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25463)|
| 7:04:28| near Dameron and Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25468)|
| 7:04:30| That's a residential neighborhood that's been zoned industrial for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25470)|
| 7:04:34| a neighborhood off Sutherland like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25474)|
| 7:04:37| The changes from residential to commercial are very minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25477)|
| 7:04:41| I think a misconception that's been placed everywhere is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25481)|
| 7:04:45| your zoning determines your tax value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25485)|
| 7:04:47| Your use determines your tax value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25487)|
| 7:04:50| The gentleman who was here earlier said that someone improving their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25490)|
| 7:04:57| the property value increases, that changes the tax value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25497)|
| 7:05:01| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25501)|
| 7:05:02| I don't see that as a bad thing for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25502)|
| 7:05:05| But it's the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25505)|
| 7:05:06| If your property zoning changes, you have a residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25506)|
| 7:05:12| and it's changed to commercial for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25512)|
| 7:05:15| you continue to use it as a residence when the tax assessor goes by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25515)|
| 7:05:21| they're not going to say, hey, this is a business zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25521)|
| 7:05:24| I'm going to value this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25524)|
| 7:05:25| No, they look at it as residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25525)|
| 7:05:28| And so I think we need to put that out and make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25528)|
| 7:05:32| I hope to have – I'm not going to actually be worth much tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25532)|
| 7:05:36| so I won't be doing a lot of work on that spreadsheet that shows the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25536)|
| 7:05:42| But the first of next week I'll provide that to the mayor for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25542)|
| 7:05:45| and then send it on to the rest of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25545)|
| 7:05:48| And it shows in detail what went from ag to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25548)|
| 7:05:52| ag to industrial, ag to agricultural, ag for each zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25552)|
| 7:05:58| And you can see that the changes were actually pretty minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25558)|
| 7:06:03| In addition to the industrial to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25563)|
| 7:06:06| some of the major ones were from residential to institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25566)|
| 7:06:10| because a lot of schools, the largest schools, over five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25570)|
| 7:06:14| and churches over five acres were zoned institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25574)|
| 7:06:18| because we felt that was more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25578)|
| 7:06:21| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25581)|
| 7:06:23| And I'm getting a little addled at this hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25583)|
| 7:06:25| Let me just sum that up by saying during this next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25585)|
| 7:06:28| as each of you are able to meet individually with Gerald and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25588)|
| 7:06:33| look at that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25593)|
| 7:06:34| I think a lot of this will be clear to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25594)|
| 7:06:36| and you'll be able to further explain to those who are texting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25596)|
| 7:06:39| and help spread the word that this isn't the boogeyman thing that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25599)|
| 7:06:45| that some people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25605)|
| 7:06:47| But I think once you see those maps and see what he's talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25607)|
| 7:06:50| it'll be easier to explain to individuals what's really proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25610)|
| 7:06:54| And, again, you still have to vote on that map, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25614)|
| 7:06:58| So nothing is decided on all of those, wherever the changes that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25618)|
| 7:07:04| Most of them are basically equivalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25624)|
| 7:07:06| but there are certain things that have been changed, as he mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25626)|
| 7:07:09| So it'll become clear to council as we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25629)|
| 7:07:14| And that was the point I wanted to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25634)|
| 7:07:15| when they say all 74,000 parcels will be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25635)|
| 7:07:19| The name may change, but the use will remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25639)|
| 7:07:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25643)|
| 7:07:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25644)|
| 7:07:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25645)|
| 7:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25646)|
| 7:07:27| Now, before we get off, we do have on page 15-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25647)|
| 7:07:31| we talked about how the language was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25651)|
| 7:07:34| to accommodate our terminology and state law requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25654)|
| 7:07:37| But we do want to add at the bottom of page 15-5, after G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25657)|
| 7:07:43| we want to add H, which says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25663)|
| 7:07:46| Article 15.3 is controlling, notwithstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25666)|
| 7:07:49| any other section of this zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25669)|
| 7:07:53| And that ensures state law compliance with the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25673)|
| 7:07:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25677)|
| 7:07:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25678)|
| 7:07:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25679)|
| 7:08:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25680)|
| 7:08:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25681)|
| 7:08:02| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25682)|
| 7:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25683)|
| 7:08:04| Anything else on 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25684)|
| 7:08:07| Moving on to 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25687)|
| 7:08:08| This is zoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25688)|
| 7:08:10| There are several edits, as you can see, that hopefully we can work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25690)|
| 7:08:17| Any general comments, Gerald, on 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25697)|
| 7:08:21| The major things were taking standards for our current code for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25701)|
| 7:08:28| making those the standards for approval of special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25708)|
| 7:08:31| the current standards for approval of variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25711)|
| 7:08:34| and making those the standards for approval of variances under the new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25714)|
| 7:08:40| putting in the time limit for city council action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25720)|
| 7:08:42| on rezoning the 120-day time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25722)|
| 7:08:47| The rest, I think, in my mind, minor clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25727)|
| 7:08:54| Nothing as major as those taking standards from our current code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25734)|
| 7:08:58| and incorporating those as opposed to standards that are more national standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25738)|
| 7:09:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25744)|
| 7:09:05| So we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25745)|
| 7:09:06| We'll kind of work through these because we do have several of these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25746)|
| 7:09:08| that start on page 3 of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25748)|
| 7:09:11| We're only on page 3 of this document, but most of these are Article 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25751)|
| 7:09:16| The first one is page 16-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25756)|
| 7:09:19| If you look at 16.1D, which is kind of in the middle of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25759)|
| 7:09:25| under that first paragraph under D, Procedure, what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25765)|
| 7:09:31| what FAFSA is recommending is that in the sentence, it is the first, second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25771)|
| 7:09:38| the third sentence, it says amendments initiated by the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190530RecodeReview?start=25778)|
