| 0:01:44| The first item on the agenda is a public forum and Drusilla posted this and to find out if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=104)|
| 0:01:53| any members of the public wanted to comment on this updated ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Drusilla, did anybody express an interest in commenting on this particular public ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| that we're changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| No, as of up to the meeting time now, I've not received any emails, phone calls or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| regarding interest in speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| But I know that this, even if no one expressed an interest, this meeting is being recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| and broadcast to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| So it's important for the public welfare to know exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| So that said, the next item on our agenda is a discussion of ordinance 0-20-4-101 proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=145)|
| 0:02:35| amendments to the Knox County Code, Appendix A, Zoning Article 3, Section 3.5, off-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=155)|

| 0:02:45| reducing the minimum number of off-street parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=165)|

| 0:02:52| County Commission Office, Suite 603 in the city county building or call us and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| a member of the public can email you that link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| I affectionately refer to this as the dollar general fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| I'll look to Commissioner Bieler just to sort of give a quick synopsis and see if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| any additional discussion required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| At the chair's pleasure, I'd like to defer to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| He actually has been working on this longer than I have and also invite Mr. Green to weigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Commissioner Daley and then Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| Thank you, Commissioner Bieler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| This has been going on for, I guess, John, what, 15, 14 years since we, now 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| This all started many years ago in BZA where everyone had to come, not everyone, but a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| lot of people would have to come and ask for a hundred space parking lot to be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| to, say, 30 because of our archaic claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| So this is thankful for a dollar general in Richie's district out there that it finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| sometimes it takes someone to get mad and be turned down to get action started and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| basically is what happened to get this ball really rolling hard was, I believe, Richie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| I think at the September, Gerald can confirm this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| You know, the dollar general come to reduce their parking lot down from, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| how many, down to 36 and dollar general knows how many people are going to be in their parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| lot for how long before another one comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| They are very, very good at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| So unfortunately they got turned down at the BZA, I believe if I'm correct, right, Richie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| And then I had the BZA chair, Mr. Robert Thompson from the ninth district write a letter stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| that this is a problem that we need to be addressed and Richie and I, unforeseen, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| were both working on it, but we couldn't talk to each other because of the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| So we all met up in the Gerald's office and we discussed this and come up with a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| and Richie, I hope it's not too late for the family and dollar general out there, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| is a great ordinance change that let engineering look at it and say, hey, you got 10,000 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| That doesn't mean that you need 70 parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| You show me that you're going to have 36 spaces and your flow of traffic will never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| be that full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| There's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| And I think this is a great ordinance and I'm glad that Richie got involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| So I'm supporting it a hundred percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| If I may, Mr. Chairman, I think it gives great latitude to the planning staff as well to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| make a good decision on each case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| I don't have much to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I think the commissioners did a good job of explaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| What we're doing is allowing a study to be done by applicants to identify their parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| And that study would be reviewed by planning and engineering public work staff and acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| The number of parking spaces required could be reduced below that required by our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Standards in the zoning ordinance are probably 40, 50 years old when the parking demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| were far different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| This is a first phase of an update of the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| The planning staff will work with the community to identify new minimum number of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| spaces for uses that's more compatible with the demands and needs of businesses and offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| today than the current ordinance, which again is 40 or 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| We've received no negative comments, a few comments in support, but overall it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| a positive and has been reviewed by the law, the county law director's office, the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| public work staff and planning staff and recommended for approval unanimously by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=429)|

| 0:07:41| By the way, before we do this, everybody point to where Commissioner Biggs is on your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Commissioner Biggs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| First off, Director Green, I hope we I hope we get to see you at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| I know you're probably anticipating your retirement and thank you for everything that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| But my question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| I sit on TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| And how will this impact that as well as how do you foresee this impacting basically companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=492)|
| 0:08:22| that might be drawn to here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Will it be something to help sell them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Is this something that we're going to give the ability of the chamber or things of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| nature that will help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| And just kind of give me a little brief rundown on that from your view, if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| I think it will be a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| One of the greatest costs that businesses have to face is the cost of land for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| And by reducing the number of parking spaces required, we reduce the land cost and allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| them to use their money, monies more efficiently and effectively on building on filling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| building with goods or paying employees as opposed to paving land that won't be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Not only reduces their cost, it reduces the cost to the community because there's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| land available for other development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| We're generating more property tax dollars by allowing more development to occur on less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| So it's just using our resources more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| And I think that will attract more business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| And I am looking forward to having other things to do on evenings than attend, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| your meetings are exciting and very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| I'm looking forward to doing something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Director Green, I want to make sure there's safeguards in this because business models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| are always changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| You have a piece of property that is zoned for for multiple, many, many different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| Let's say a business that has a low traffic count wants to reduce to 10, 15 parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=602)|
| 0:10:13| and then that business model goes out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Won't they be limiting future uses for that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| There's always that possibility, but I think we also look at the national trends and nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| the amount of parking demand for all uses is being reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| So I think the overall the benefits will far outweigh any detriment from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| And as we look at providing permits for a change of use, the parking would be looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| at again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| And of course, the the potential buyer or leaser of a property would look at the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| that's available and determine whether that particular property is suitable for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| And that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| You may you may wind up with a property that's not suitable for any use because there isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| adequate parking because someone ran a business model out of it that didn't require much parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| and then they go out of business and there's no parking for any of the other models of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| business that may choose that are looking that are out in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| Based on what we've seen and looking at national models and following trends, the overall trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| is for reduced parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| So I believe there will always be a use available for property that becomes vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| I think they're called trends because they are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| There's constant trends changing one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| But I just want to make sure that if somebody does buy one of these buildings that has had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| reduced parking and their business model is going to require more parking, will MPC have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| the power to say, you can use this, but you have to add parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| The planning staff, the planning commission or the codes administration could require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| that depending on what level it rises to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| OK, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Commissioner Biggs and Smith, you've still got your blue hands up, but they all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| I just wanted to address your question, Commissioner Smith, as part of and Gerald alluded to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| when when an occupancy in a building changes, my staff does look at that and we would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| prior to issuance of a building permit that the required parking space number for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| changed use was there or we would hold that building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| So there is a safeguard in place on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-public-hearing?start=781)|
