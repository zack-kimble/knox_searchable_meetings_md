| 0:07:43| and everybody's there able to talk through the challenges that they have together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=463.0)|
| 0:07:48| And from my perspective, I can see that there's positive steps in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=468.0)|
| 0:07:53| I do want to thank Director Seymour here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=473.0)|
| 0:07:57| He came along in the middle of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=477.0)|
| 0:07:59| and that's been another very positive addition that the county has stepped forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=479.0)|
| 0:08:03| to help with the coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=483.0)|
| 0:08:06| and also to help with that subject matter expertise in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=486.0)|
| 0:08:11| that will help you to make good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=491.0)|
| 0:08:14| as you're managing the growth and the challenges that do come with population changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=494.0)|
| 0:08:20| So back in April, I did a presentation to the Fire and Rescue Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=500.0)|
| 0:08:28| This is a condensed version of that, so it's not going to be the entire length of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=508.0)|
| 0:08:32| I think each of you have the packet or the copy of that in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=512.0)|
| 0:08:36| so there may be some stuff in here that sparks your interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=516.0)|
| 0:08:39| and you can go in and look at that and get a little bit more down in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=519.0)|
| 0:08:44| So the scope of the project, as requested by the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=524.0)|
| 0:08:48| was basically sort of a refresh of the previous presentation that was done back in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=528.0)|
| 0:08:54| And obviously, on top of the fact that we've had population explosions here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=534.0)|
| 0:08:59| and a few other areas of the state, lots changed since 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=539.0)|
| 0:09:03| and this was just an opportunity to see, hey, where are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=543.0)|
| 0:09:08| What is the impact, as you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=548.0)|
| 0:09:10| So some of the focus areas are the calls for service and incident data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=550.0)|
| 0:09:14| So there's some pretty extensive charts broken down by each fire station and district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=554.0)|
| 0:09:20| So the fire stations that are in your communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=560.0)|
| 0:09:25| you'll be able to look at those specifically to see about coverage areas, response times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=565.0)|
| 0:09:30| type of calls, those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=570.0)|
| 0:09:33| Also looking at the apparatus, and just back on the service and incident data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=573.0)|
| 0:09:38| we looked at about 21,000 calls in that one-year service period, took that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=578.0)|
| 0:09:44| geolocated all of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=584.0)|
| 0:09:46| I believe there was additional data that was provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=586.0)|
| 0:09:48| but some of those were duplicates where you had multiple departments responding together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=588.0)|
| 0:09:54| Some of the highlights of that, the busiest stations, and it's been this way for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=594.0)|
| 0:09:59| but Carnes is definitely on the rise, but Station 30 in Halls, 41 in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=599.0)|
| 0:10:04| there on Campbell Station Road are the two busiest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=604.0)|
| 0:10:06| and then the Carnes District 1 is right behind them with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=606.0)|
| 0:10:11| And that definitely goes in line with the growth that we'll show you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=611.0)|
| 0:10:16| As far as apparatus goes, there have been some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=616.0)|
| 0:10:20| some positive changes, additions in the time period from 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=620.0)|
| 0:10:25| which did affect some of the average age of the apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=625.0)|
| 0:10:28| The challenges with fire apparatus is that they're getting much more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=628.0)|
| 0:10:32| and they're also a significantly delayed timeline to get them from specifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=632.0)|
| 0:10:38| to on the ground and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=638.0)|
| 0:10:41| It's about 36 to 48 months to get a firetruck now, a new firetruck built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=641.0)|
| 0:10:46| and that also increases about 8% of the cost per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=646.0)|
| 0:10:50| So when you look at the average ages, and you'll see that in the study there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=650.0)|
| 0:10:54| kind of add four years on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=654.0)|
| 0:10:56| So if there are changes that the departments need to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=656.0)|
| 0:10:59| they're already four years behind the eight ball pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=659.0)|
| 0:11:03| and significantly the cost just continues to increase significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=663.0)|
| 0:11:09| The service coverage area, we broke that down very extensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=669.0)|
| 0:11:13| so there's several pages dedicated to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=673.0)|
| 0:11:17| A very positive thing for here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=677.0)|
| 0:11:19| and all the departments should be committed for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=679.0)|
| 0:11:21| about where they've placed their fire stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=681.0)|
| 0:11:24| is that there is about 95.6% of the buildings in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=684.0)|
| 0:11:28| are within five driving miles of a fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=688.0)|
| 0:11:31| Very few places in the state have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=691.0)|
| 0:11:35| and especially for an area as concentrated as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=695.0)|
| 0:11:38| and also as challenging as the response district is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=698.0)|
| 0:11:41| as you'll see on the map here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=701.0)|
| 0:11:44| The significance of the five driving miles has to do with the ISO and insurance ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=704.0)|
| 0:11:49| so anything over five driving miles is considered a Class 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=709.0)|
| 0:11:53| regardless of how good your fire department ISO ratings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=713.0)|
| 0:11:57| In Knox County, they have very good ISO ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=717.0)|
| 0:12:00| You have a three, a four, and a five, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=720.0)|
| 0:12:03| which from a residential perspective is very...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=723.0)|
| 0:12:05| I mean, there's very little differences between that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=725.0)|
| 0:12:10| And then the stations and response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=730.0)|
| 0:12:12| So we looked at 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=732.0)|
| 0:12:14| I think there's 24 stations in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=734.0)|
| 0:12:16| Ten of those are 25 years or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=736.0)|
| 0:12:19| And there's a breakdown, there's a chart in the study as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=739.0)|
| 0:12:22| and it shows rural metro Carnes and Seymours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=742.0)|
| 0:12:26| As you'll see, most rural metro stations are leased facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=746.0)|
| 0:12:31| and that will, over time, will factor into decisions, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=751.0)|
| 0:12:36| that would need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=756.0)|
| 0:12:39| The study area does include Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=759.0)|
| 0:12:41| and the reason for that is, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:43| they don't provide their own emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=763.0)|
| 0:12:46| so it was easier just to include them in looking at this as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=766.0)|
| 0:12:50| as opposed to signaling them out with Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=770.0)|
| 0:12:53| which has its own fire department emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=773.0)|
| 0:12:58| So this map here shows you the station, the districts for each station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=778.0)|
| 0:13:03| So it's a little complicated when you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=783.0)|
| 0:13:07| well, whose department is what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=787.0)|
| 0:13:09| As you see on the southeast side there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=789.0)|
| 0:13:12| you have Seymour, and Seymour has two stations inside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=792.0)|
| 0:13:16| And for the purpose of the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=796.0)|
| 0:13:18| we just combined those into one response area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=798.0)|
| 0:13:21| They also have an additional, I think, five stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=801.0)|
| 0:13:25| in Blount and Sevier County that come into Knox County to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=805.0)|
| 0:13:29| and vice versa, the stations here go over there to help as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=809.0)|
| 0:13:34| Carnes has four stations, and we combined those into two districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=814.0)|
| 0:13:39| And the reason for that is that you have two stations that are staffed 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=819.0)|
| 0:13:44| and then they have two stations that are just house apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=824.0)|
| 0:13:48| There's no ability to staff those stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=828.0)|
| 0:13:51| so it was easier to combine those to looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=831.0)|
| 0:13:56| And then all the rest of the stations and the districts up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=836.0)|
| 0:13:59| are rural metro's response districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=839.0)|
| 0:14:06| If anybody has any questions as we go along, please feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=846.0)|
| 0:14:11| So this next map here is using the GIS tools that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=851.0)|
| 0:14:18| and placing all the business and houses in the models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=858.0)|
| 0:14:24| This is basically a heat map showing where your concentration of buildings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=864.0)|
| 0:14:29| And as you can see, the transportation corridors west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=869.0)|
| 0:14:35| much more concentrated, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=875.0)|
| 0:14:38| so none of this is really any groundbreaking information for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=878.0)|
| 0:14:41| but it does show those densities of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=881.0)|
| 0:14:44| A very positive thing is that where the fire stations have been located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=884.0)|
| 0:14:49| are, for the most part, really within those concentrated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=889.0)|
| 0:14:53| So what that does is that that helps response times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=893.0)|
| 0:14:56| because where the concentrations of the development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=896.0)|
| 0:15:01| is typically where the concentrations of incidents are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=901.0)|
| 0:15:04| and we found that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=904.0)|
| 0:15:08| So one thing that we look at when we're looking at where you're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=908.0)|
| 0:15:13| is where you've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=913.0)|
| 0:15:15| And so taking permit data for residential and commercial and remodel and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=915.0)|
| 0:15:22| and plotting that, and then breaking that out by fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=922.0)|
| 0:15:27| So as you see here, both of the Karnes stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=927.0)|
| 0:15:31| have a pretty high peak as far as construction goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=931.0)|
| 0:15:36| You also, Halls, which is Station 30, is coming in there second for 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=936.0)|
| 0:15:43| and then Farragut with 41 and 42, those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=943.0)|
| 0:15:49| So all areas did have growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=949.0)|
| 0:15:54| Some of those were pretty exponential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=954.0)|
| 0:15:56| and when you're looking at a percentage of increase from 2010 to 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=956.0)|
| 0:16:03| some of the impacts are pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=963.0)|
| 0:16:09| Here's a breakdown by district of the populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=969.0)|
| 0:16:14| and the interesting thing about Knox County is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=974.0)|
| 0:16:16| and I know that I had looked at this a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=976.0)|
| 0:16:20| and it may or may not still be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=980.0)|
| 0:16:22| but I think Knox County has the highest population percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=982.0)|
| 0:16:26| outside of the major city limits than any other county in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=986.0)|
| 0:16:31| So if it's not still true, it's definitely very high up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=991.0)|
| 0:16:37| but typically most other places in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=997.0)|
| 0:16:40| have very little commercial outside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1000.0)|
| 0:16:44| and the percentages of population are typically within incorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1004.0)|
| 0:16:50| So as you see here, the total study area increased by 14.2% over 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1010.0)|
| 0:16:58| and that's a significant amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1018.0)|
| 0:16:59| especially when you're looking at the baseline of 252,000 in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1019.0)|
| 0:17:05| Karnes grew quite a bit, so about a third increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1025.0)|
| 0:17:09| in the size and density of that, and as you drive through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1029.0)|
| 0:17:13| at least as I have here lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1033.0)|
| 0:17:14| trying to avoid some traffic on the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1034.0)|
| 0:17:16| I'm just pretty amazed by all the growth, both the density as well as the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1036.0)|
| 0:17:24| So that kind of led into, and this was done independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1044.0)|
| 0:17:27| but I believe that the planning did an advanced Knox study recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1047.0)|
| 0:17:34| that did show the impacts of the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1054.0)|
| 0:17:37| Some of the facts from that is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1057.0)|
| 0:17:40| Knox County is in the top 5% in the country for growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1060.0)|
| 0:17:44| as far as its population size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1064.0)|
| 0:17:49| Growth impacts emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1069.0)|
| 0:17:51| So whether you're looking at fire, rescue, EMS, law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1071.0)|
| 0:17:56| it all has to do, it all impacts emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1076.0)|
| 0:18:01| and emergency services are also one of those quality of life measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1081.0)|
| 0:18:04| that sometimes are hard to, they're kind of hard to quantify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1084.0)|
| 0:18:07| but those are things that people are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1087.0)|
| 0:18:09| when they're bringing in development and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1089.0)|
| 0:18:13| as well as just feeling safe in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1093.0)|
| 0:18:17| So with that in mind, you know, it's definitely important for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1097.0)|
| 0:18:22| to be looking at that public safety, emergency services side of the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1102.0)|
| 0:18:29| as these plans come down the pike and are looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1109.0)|
| 0:18:38| I told you this was a Cliff Notes version of what we got back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1118.0)|
| 0:18:43| So some of the major recommendations in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1123.0)|
| 0:18:49| and training facilities is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1129.0)|
| 0:18:54| One, from a cost to build training facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1134.0)|
| 0:18:58| but also to make it relevant for the departments to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1138.0)|
| 0:19:03| The number of fires, generally speaking, across the country are decreasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1143.0)|
| 0:19:09| When I and this young man got on the job many moons ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1149.0)|
| 0:19:16| and we actually worked on a truck together a time or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1156.0)|
| 0:19:19| and we had a lot of fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1159.0)|
| 0:19:22| And so while we had the great, you know, we did training program obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1162.0)|
| 0:19:27| but there was that continual amount of fires that were going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1167.0)|
| 0:19:30| that you were helping to kind of hone your skills and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1170.0)|
| 0:19:35| Now fire departments have to spend an extensive amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1175.0)|
| 0:19:38| to recreate those opportunities that you just don't see every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1178.0)|
| 0:19:42| because if it's your house that's on fire or your family's house that's on fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1182.0)|
| 0:19:46| they've got to be ready all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1186.0)|
| 0:19:48| And so training is a very huge thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1188.0)|
| 0:19:51| Fire departments are also becoming more of an all-hazards agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1191.0)|
| 0:19:55| and that occurrence has been happening over the last couple decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1195.0)|
| 0:19:59| But they do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1199.0)|
| 0:20:01| So from obviously fire response to emergency medical responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1201.0)|
| 0:20:07| hazardous materials, rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1207.0)|
| 0:20:10| they have to have the ability to develop those skills as well as to maintain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1210.0)|
| 0:20:17| So training facilities is something that I had mentioned back in the previous study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1217.0)|
| 0:20:22| and it's a challenge because as you see the geography of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1222.0)|
| 0:20:26| what a big area that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1226.0)|
| 0:20:29| the best case scenario is something more centrally located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1229.0)|
| 0:20:33| or the second best scenario would be maybe two smaller facilities in different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1233.0)|
| 0:20:39| so that you're not drawing from one extreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1239.0)|
| 0:20:41| because it takes a while to get from one end of the county to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1241.0)|
| 0:20:45| and to take those units out of service for that amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1245.0)|
| 0:20:49| Fire stations and equipment, that's something that I see is a big need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1249.0)|
| 0:20:57| Not only the fact that you have aging facilities that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1257.0)|
| 0:21:03| very few are actually owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1263.0)|
| 0:21:06| and then also those that are here lack what we consider the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1266.0)|
| 0:21:13| when building new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1273.0)|
| 0:21:15| So as a public safety facility as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1275.0)|
| 0:21:18| you're looking at hardened facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1278.0)|
| 0:21:20| something that's going to endure that severe storm that comes along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1280.0)|
| 0:21:23| that's able to operate when the power is out for two or three or four days or longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1283.0)|
| 0:21:29| and have more resilience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1289.0)|
| 0:21:33| So as the growth occurs, as the demands from an incident side increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1293.0)|
| 0:21:44| the five-mile standard is probably going to be decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1304.0)|
| 0:21:48| because just like in the city, you have stations that are closer together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1308.0)|
| 0:21:52| because of population and call volume and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1312.0)|
| 0:21:56| So that is something that the county can look into, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1316.0)|
| 0:22:03| as far as investing in public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1323.0)|
| 0:22:06| And it's not just from a fire safety perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1326.0)|
| 0:22:09| but these facilities can be used by all the emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1329.0)|
| 0:22:14| One thing that I've recommended across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1334.0)|
| 0:22:16| and several counties are doing is kind of have an all-hazard substations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1336.0)|
| 0:22:20| where you have fire apparatus and quarters for EMS as well as rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1340.0)|
| 0:22:26| and even emergency management with other specialized tools and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1346.0)|
| 0:22:31| A lot of them are also putting in a small police precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1351.0)|
| 0:22:35| so when the sheriff's office can come, they can come by there and do their reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1355.0)|
| 0:22:39| They can get on, if they're having issues with their Internet in their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1359.0)|
| 0:22:42| they can get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1362.0)|
| 0:22:44| They can use the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1364.0)|
| 0:22:46| They can take just a little bit of a decompression break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1366.0)|
| 0:22:49| and still be right there in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1369.0)|
| 0:22:52| The advantages of that are obviously we're not building different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1372.0)|
| 0:22:56| in the same area for services that are related to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1376.0)|
| 0:23:02| but also it gives you that investment of knowing that no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1382.0)|
| 0:23:07| the county owns that piece of property and they own that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1387.0)|
| 0:23:10| and if things change in the future, then you've got some infrastructure that's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1390.0)|
| 0:23:16| And then the last one as far as the coordination goes on there is the bullet point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1396.0)|
| 0:23:23| is that the next step in moving forward with fire protection in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1403.0)|
| 0:23:31| is for the county to consider the, lost my words here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1411.0)|
| 0:23:40| basically enacting the Knox County Fire Rescue Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1420.0)|
| 0:23:45| and that's allowed by statute 517-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1425.0)|
| 0:23:49| And what that does is that that can mean several different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1429.0)|
| 0:23:54| and what I would foresee for Knox County is that that's that umbrella organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1434.0)|
| 0:23:59| that is invested in providing services to the citizens and visitors of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1439.0)|
| 0:24:06| The existing departments can still remain, and I would encourage that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1446.0)|
| 0:24:10| but you could also at that time start entering into more performance-based contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1450.0)|
| 0:24:16| to where that way there's some checks and balances in the services that are being delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1456.0)|
| 0:24:24| It also allows the county to kind of step in, and where you have private departments in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1464.0)|
| 0:24:29| they're not always eligible for some of the other opportunities and grants and other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1469.0)|
| 0:24:34| and the county can step in of, hey, this is a functional arm by contract of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1474.0)|
| 0:24:41| and be able to help support some of those additional opportunities that come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1481.0)|
| 0:24:46| That's it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1486.0)|
| 0:24:49| There is some more, obviously, in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1489.0)|
| 0:24:52| It does go into more details, but hopefully I wrote it in a way that you can zone in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1492.0)|
| 0:24:58| and hone in on your areas if you have more interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1498.0)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1503.0)|
| 0:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1508.0)|
| 0:25:11| By the way, I did have my report from 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1511.0)|
| 0:25:15| and I see you went from 57 pages up to about the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1515.0)|
| 0:25:20| But my question is, looking at the apparatus chart, for instance, rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1520.0)|
| 0:25:29| it's my understanding with the movement to electric vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1529.0)|
| 0:25:34| that a typical internal combustion engine car fire requires about 500 gallons of water to put it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1534.0)|
| 0:25:43| And I understand with a pure electric vehicle, it could be upwards of about 5,000 gallons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1543.0)|
| 0:25:50| But yet none of the apparatus can hold that kind of quantity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1550.0)|
| 0:25:55| So in an electric vehicle fire, you're going to have to send multiple equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1555.0)|
| 0:26:01| as opposed to one on an internal combustion engine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1561.0)|
| 0:26:04| So in your recommendations, did you suggest that with the implementation of more electric cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1564.0)|
| 0:26:11| that they need to look at different kinds of equipment to hold more water to handle those needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1571.0)|
| 0:26:17| So I did not get into the electric vehicle, but you're absolutely right as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1577.0)|
| 0:26:22| It will take, if you're using the apparatus that they have now, a significant amount of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1582.0)|
| 0:26:27| to be able to deliver the initial water as well as probably go back and get more water to bring to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1587.0)|
| 0:26:34| In the past, a house fire could be put out with well under 5,000 gallons of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1594.0)|
| 0:26:40| Actually, ISO has a much lower threshold for that initial response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1600.0)|
| 0:26:44| So those are things that, as technology changes and as your impacts of the community do change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1604.0)|
| 0:26:56| I hate to give him a plug, but that's a perfect example of why you have a public safety director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1616.0)|
| 0:27:01| that is looking at that granular level of that and making those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1621.0)|
| 0:27:07| But your facts are spot on, so good job on your research on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1627.0)|
| 0:27:15| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1635.0)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1637.0)|
| 0:27:18| Thank you for the presentation, for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1638.0)|
| 0:27:21| I also looked through the other recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1641.0)|
| 0:27:27| Was it 2019 that we sort of started the conversation and then it quickly died about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1647.0)|
| 0:27:33| what does Knox County do as it continues to grow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1653.0)|
| 0:27:36| Are you aware of any other county in the state of Tennessee or a neighboring state that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1656.0)|
| 0:27:43| grew to our size and essentially went from a service in which we don't pay for but we contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1663.0)|
| 0:27:50| this private sector and convert it into a public sector as recommended where we contract it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1670.0)|
| 0:27:58| and begin paying for services directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1678.0)|
| 0:28:02| So the model here is very unique with Rural Metro being your majority provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1682.0)|
| 0:28:10| and how that grew out of the smaller volunteer departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1690.0)|
| 0:28:14| It's in the 2019 state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1694.0)|
| 0:28:16| We kind of walked through that progression there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1696.0)|
| 0:28:19| In the state, not only here in the Knox County area, I live in Murfreesboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1699.0)|
| 0:28:25| and it's, you know, it's exploding as well, and all the area around Nashville is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1705.0)|
| 0:28:30| And those counties are really struggling with some of the same stuff that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1710.0)|
| 0:28:35| And while they have invested by donation, just similar to what Knox County has with giving Karns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1715.0)|
| 0:28:43| and Seymour and the Rescue Squad a donation over the last couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1723.0)|
| 0:28:47| they're looking at, okay, we've, our public is kind of demanding a higher level of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1727.0)|
| 0:28:55| and we also want to have more control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1735.0)|
| 0:28:58| So several of them have gone to a more, they're into the fire business themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1738.0)|
| 0:29:05| and even more so than what this recommendation is, and not saying necessarily forcefully taking over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1745.0)|
| 0:29:14| but definitely encouraging the consolidation of departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1754.0)|
| 0:29:18| Most counties have anywhere from 5 to 10, 12 volunteer departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1758.0)|
| 0:29:24| So a benefit that you have here in Knox County is that you only have three departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1764.0)|
| 0:29:28| so it is easier to coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1768.0)|
| 0:29:32| But are you aware of one that, a county that's actually made the switch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1772.0)|
| 0:29:36| I know everybody's talking about this, but is one, like can you say here is a comparable-sized county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1776.0)|
| 0:29:42| and they went from not paying a dollar and working with private entity partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1782.0)|
| 0:29:46| to saying we're going to take this on and start spending taxpayer money and convert to this system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1786.0)|
| 0:29:51| Yeah, Rutherford County is one, and that's where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1791.0)|
| 0:29:54| So it's gone through the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1794.0)|
| 0:29:56| And how long has that been and how has it gone on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1796.0)|
| 0:29:59| They passed the Rutherford County Fire Rescue in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1799.0)|
| 0:30:02| That was three of the original departments became that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1802.0)|
| 0:30:05| and then they did the contract with the other volunteer departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1805.0)|
| 0:30:10| And then over time, the departments have just one or two at a time have come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1810.0)|
| 0:30:15| I think there's still two or three volunteer departments that are left that are independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1815.0)|
| 0:30:19| but they're on a contract with the county, and so they get a certain amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1819.0)|
| 0:30:23| The county supplies their apparatus, their air packs, their turnout gear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1823.0)|
| 0:30:27| so they're getting a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1827.0)|
| 0:30:29| Williamson County is similar as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1829.0)|
| 0:30:32| They still are mostly in the volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1832.0)|
| 0:30:35| but they've consolidated down to two or three volunteer departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1835.0)|
| 0:30:39| and they provide stations, apparatus, all of the hard cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1839.0)|
| 0:30:45| So the departments themselves, maybe uniforms and some just specific things that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1845.0)|
| 0:30:54| How is that worked with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1854.0)|
| 0:30:56| Right now we have a private entity that is spending their own capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1856.0)|
| 0:30:59| even though they may get financial support from us, to put in Station 30 and halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1859.0)|
| 0:31:05| They own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1865.0)|
| 0:31:06| They own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1866.0)|
| 0:31:07| They own the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1867.0)|
| 0:31:09| They own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1869.0)|
| 0:31:10| They own the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1870.0)|
| 0:31:11| If Knox County were to contract, would they continue to own all those assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1871.0)|
| 0:31:18| or would Knox County be in the business of asset management as well and taking all those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1878.0)|
| 0:31:25| It would depend upon how your contract would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1885.0)|
| 0:31:27| The way that I would foresee that is that, as things are now, they would maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1887.0)|
| 0:31:33| But there's a few of their stations that are in need of either movement or replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1893.0)|
| 0:31:38| based upon just the conditions that they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1898.0)|
| 0:31:43| and those would be what I would suggest looking at as maybe the first investment that the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1903.0)|
| 0:31:50| in helping to put a hard facility that the county owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1910.0)|
| 0:31:55| enter into a cooperative agreement with them to operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1915.0)|
| 0:31:59| That could be one of those dollar a year things or whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1919.0)|
| 0:32:02| That way the county would start having some investment in infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1922.0)|
| 0:32:08| but they would still be responsible for most of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1928.0)|
| 0:32:12| Commissioner Daley, maybe you can help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1932.0)|
| 0:32:17| Is the committee taking this and actively trying to figure out how does it apply to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1937.0)|
| 0:32:23| and beginning to make recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1943.0)|
| 0:32:25| Because we did go through this in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1945.0)|
| 0:32:27| We had a great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1947.0)|
| 0:32:29| Everyone said this is wonderful, and then as soon as anybody said it's going to cost a dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1949.0)|
| 0:32:35| they all went, nope, and we stuck it on a shelf, and here we are four years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1955.0)|
| 0:32:39| Is the goal of redoing this today to then spark a plan for what do we do in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1959.0)|
| 0:32:45| or is this going to sit on a shelf for four more years and we'll revisit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1965.0)|
| 0:32:50| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1970.0)|
| 0:32:51| Mr. VanDeVate, come on down if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1971.0)|
| 0:32:55| I don't think this study was, the study is to see what we need and where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1975.0)|
| 0:33:00| Is there legs under it to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1980.0)|
| 0:33:03| I don't see it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1983.0)|
| 0:33:05| Mr. VanDeVate was our chair for two years, and do we need some action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1985.0)|
| 0:33:11| I like the idea of the county owning the building or owning the apparatus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1991.0)|
| 0:33:18| and contracting it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1998.0)|
| 0:33:19| It's easier for the volunteer fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=1999.0)|
| 0:33:23| Mr. VanDeVate, I'll let you follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2003.0)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you, Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2005.0)|
| 0:33:27| Thank you for some good and thought-provoking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2007.0)|
| 0:33:31| We're pretty deep into what our various options might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2011.0)|
| 0:33:37| but we always want to come back to our starting place, which is if it isn't broken, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2017.0)|
| 0:33:44| If you think about fire protection from the standpoint just operationally of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2024.0)|
| 0:33:49| are lives being lost, is property being lost, are there issues of underperformance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2029.0)|
| 0:33:55| then the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2035.0)|
| 0:33:58| We have three highly performing fire agencies in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2038.0)|
| 0:34:02| Carnes, which is subscription-based and a non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2042.0)|
| 0:34:05| Rural Metro, which is subscription-based and a for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2045.0)|
| 0:34:08| and Seymour, which is primarily a volunteer agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2048.0)|
| 0:34:12| It's a bit complicated, but it's working and it's working pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2052.0)|
| 0:34:15| We think it can work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2055.0)|
| 0:34:19| One of the things that we think we should do as a county is, over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2059.0)|
| 0:34:24| provide more investment and more support in these agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2064.0)|
| 0:34:28| but not necessarily insource them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2068.0)|
| 0:34:31| There's no need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2071.0)|
| 0:34:32| They're functioning well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2072.0)|
| 0:34:36| into a place where we have a framework that, as Mr. Lauer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2076.0)|
| 0:34:42| allows us to have performance-based contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2082.0)|
| 0:34:45| where we can both set expectations that we have of the agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2085.0)|
| 0:34:49| and the agencies can come to us and say, here are our expectations of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2089.0)|
| 0:34:53| Right now, that relationship just sort of exists in the ether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2093.0)|
| 0:34:56| A great starting place is this creation of a fire department, as Mr. Lauer recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2096.0)|
| 0:35:04| which is fundamentally just a structure that creates a department and a chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2104.0)|
| 0:35:07| and that chief would have the ability to execute contracts with the agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2107.0)|
| 0:35:12| and those contracts can set these kind of standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2112.0)|
| 0:35:15| whether they're NFPA standards or whatever they might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2115.0)|
| 0:35:18| and expectations that the two parties have of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2118.0)|
| 0:35:21| That is the model that the town of Farragut uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2121.0)|
| 0:35:23| The town of Farragut actually has a contract with Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2123.0)|
| 0:35:25| Knox County does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2125.0)|
| 0:35:30| I think our initial step would be just to try to formalize the framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2130.0)|
| 0:35:35| and put contracts in place that let the agencies continue to do the good work that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2135.0)|
| 0:35:42| but give us an opportunity to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2142.0)|
| 0:35:44| It is particularly challenging with Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2144.0)|
| 0:35:48| We cannot, nor should we, buy assets for a private for-profit corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2148.0)|
| 0:35:53| that are going to be owned by that corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2153.0)|
| 0:35:55| On the other hand, that corporation is providing vitally needed service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2155.0)|
| 0:35:58| to the majority of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2158.0)|
| 0:36:00| So is it a reasonable thing, as Commissioner Daley alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2160.0)|
| 0:36:03| if we were to build fire stations and they would operate those stations on our behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2163.0)|
| 0:36:10| We could do that with any of these agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2170.0)|
| 0:36:12| Certainly we could do it with Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2172.0)|
| 0:36:13| It would make sense there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2173.0)|
| 0:36:14| It would make sense with Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2174.0)|
| 0:36:17| But the county would be the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2177.0)|
| 0:36:20| and the agency would provide the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2180.0)|
| 0:36:22| So I don't know if that helps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2182.0)|
| 0:36:24| but that's just sort of an early overview of where we see this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2184.0)|
| 0:36:27| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2187.0)|
| 0:36:28| We've created a new position that we didn't have before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2188.0)|
| 0:36:32| so we're creating a new level of bureaucracy to begin heading in some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2192.0)|
| 0:36:38| Otherwise, we wouldn't have a new director and we wouldn't spend all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2198.0)|
| 0:36:42| Because if it wasn't broken, we didn't need to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2202.0)|
| 0:36:45| We'd just keep on moving along and we wouldn't have a new director, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2205.0)|
| 0:36:48| Well, could we substitute accountability for bureaucracy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2208.0)|
| 0:36:51| Because that's really where we're trying to go with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2211.0)|
| 0:36:54| is to define this relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2214.0)|
| 0:36:55| I'll give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2215.0)|
| 0:36:56| But I continue to wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2216.0)|
| 0:37:01| I've always struggled on how do we reconcile taking taxpayer dollars every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2221.0)|
| 0:37:08| into the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2228.0)|
| 0:37:10| to support agencies for-profit and non-profit and volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2230.0)|
| 0:37:15| yet we're taking the taxpayer dollars from somebody and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2235.0)|
| 0:37:19| you still need to be a subscriber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2239.0)|
| 0:37:21| but we're going to take some more money out of the other pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2241.0)|
| 0:37:24| and give it to the people that you're already subscribing it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2244.0)|
| 0:37:27| and subsidize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2247.0)|
| 0:37:29| We kind of have our foot in both sides of the aisle here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2249.0)|
| 0:37:33| and at some point we need to pick a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2253.0)|
| 0:37:37| We have a volunteer entity on the south side that yet can't staff itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2257.0)|
| 0:37:43| so we have this second group for-profit staffing the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2263.0)|
| 0:37:48| We have a rescue squad that also can't staff itself financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2268.0)|
| 0:37:52| so you have the for-profit funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2272.0)|
| 0:37:54| This is the biggest, most complicated thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2274.0)|
| 0:37:58| We're continuing to, I believe, double-tax the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2278.0)|
| 0:38:02| for services that they may or may not use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2282.0)|
| 0:38:05| until they definitely need to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2285.0)|
| 0:38:08| We're kind of a half-baked cookie all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2288.0)|
| 0:38:11| I just wonder, are we going to pick a direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2291.0)|
| 0:38:13| and start working towards that to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2293.0)|
| 0:38:16| every citizen of Knox County should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2296.0)|
| 0:38:19| as part of their governmental services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2299.0)|
| 0:38:21| have fire and emergency services protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2301.0)|
| 0:38:23| and then here's how we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2303.0)|
| 0:38:25| Or are we going to say you can have it or not have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2305.0)|
| 0:38:27| or we might pick it up, or you might get a bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2307.0)|
| 0:38:29| or you might show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2309.0)|
| 0:38:31| Where are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2311.0)|
| 0:38:33| That's what I'm struggling with with a new director in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2313.0)|
| 0:38:36| and a new study that tells us the same thing that we knew four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2316.0)|
| 0:38:41| Just for a little bit of context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2321.0)|
| 0:38:43| what I would say is we might have our toes in the water financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2323.0)|
| 0:38:47| but our contribution across the board of the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2327.0)|
| 0:38:50| is solidly under a million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2330.0)|
| 0:38:54| Our peers in Chattanooga, I believe, nudge closer to eight figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2334.0)|
| 0:39:00| They put substantial amounts of money into fire and emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2340.0)|
| 0:39:04| So we don't cover anybody's operational costs for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2344.0)|
| 0:39:09| We support, on a very limited basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2349.0)|
| 0:39:13| Harns and Seymour really don't support rural metro at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2353.0)|
| 0:39:17| again, because the complexities there are deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2357.0)|
| 0:39:20| and we do support the squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2360.0)|
| 0:39:23| But each of these agencies pay their own personnel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2363.0)|
| 0:39:25| They pay their own operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2365.0)|
| 0:39:27| One of the things we have to be careful of is we don't want to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2367.0)|
| 0:39:29| the impression, frankly, that the public thinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2369.0)|
| 0:39:31| well, now Knox County is paying for fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2371.0)|
| 0:39:33| so I'm going to drop my rural metro subscription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2373.0)|
| 0:39:36| That's the worst possible thing that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2376.0)|
| 0:39:38| So we try to be very clear that we might want to assist with facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2378.0)|
| 0:39:42| We might want to assist with rolling stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2382.0)|
| 0:39:44| But the cost of the fireman that's coming to your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2384.0)|
| 0:39:47| is going to be paid by you as a subscriber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2387.0)|
| 0:39:50| Subscriptions are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2390.0)|
| 0:39:52| Mine is about $700 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2392.0)|
| 0:39:54| but it's a little bit like my life insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2394.0)|
| 0:39:57| At the end of the year, I go, man, I didn't collect on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2397.0)|
| 0:40:01| It's actually a good thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2401.0)|
| 0:40:03| So that's how I view my $700 a year to rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2403.0)|
| 0:40:06| the same way I view my life insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2406.0)|
| 0:40:08| It's a necessary expense, but I'm actually glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2408.0)|
| 0:40:10| that I didn't capitalize on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2410.0)|
| 0:40:16| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2416.0)|
| 0:40:18| I feel similarly to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2418.0)|
| 0:40:24| I think the private industry usually does better than public 99% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2424.0)|
| 0:40:32| I think, and they're already taking over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2432.0)|
| 0:40:35| some of the nonprofit and volunteer sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2435.0)|
| 0:40:39| I don't see why we just let them operate those areas as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2439.0)|
| 0:40:43| since they seem to be doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2443.0)|
| 0:40:46| I also don't understand why we are hiring more bureaucrats as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2446.0)|
| 0:40:51| or whatever language you want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2451.0)|
| 0:40:55| I get if you want to support in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2455.0)|
| 0:40:59| I think structuring that would look differently in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2459.0)|
| 0:41:03| You want to build a fire station, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2463.0)|
| 0:41:07| You can lease it to the for-profit company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2467.0)|
| 0:41:10| You want to lease it at a little bit lower rate, fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2470.0)|
| 0:41:12| but lease it to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2472.0)|
| 0:41:15| The taxpayer retains the assets as ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2475.0)|
| 0:41:19| and we make money on leasing it to a for-profit company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2479.0)|
| 0:41:22| Now, you don't need to screw them on the rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2482.0)|
| 0:41:24| since they are providing a service to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2484.0)|
| 0:41:26| but something like that, I'd be more palatable, for me at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2486.0)|
| 0:41:34| You're not giving for-profit companies assets and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2494.0)|
| 0:41:38| but I would like to see it stay as private as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2498.0)|
| 0:41:43| and have us continue spending as least amount of money as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2503.0)|
| 0:41:47| from a taxpayer standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2507.0)|
| 0:41:49| and the least amount of bureaucrats as possible as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2509.0)|
| 0:41:52| That's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2512.0)|
| 0:41:55| We don't disagree, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2515.0)|
| 0:41:56| We would like to maintain the structure that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2516.0)|
| 0:41:59| We think the agencies do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2519.0)|
| 0:42:01| We do think it's incumbent upon the executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2521.0)|
| 0:42:04| to do some contingency planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2524.0)|
| 0:42:06| I don't anticipate that this would ever happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2526.0)|
| 0:42:09| but, for instance, I'll pick on Carnes as an example to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2529.0)|
| 0:42:13| Carnes is a 501c3 run by a non-profit board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2533.0)|
| 0:42:17| Should the board of directors run into a moment of profound disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2537.0)|
| 0:42:21| and dissolve or just decide they can't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2541.0)|
| 0:42:23| and they're not going to collect subscription dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2543.0)|
| 0:42:25| and they're not going to run the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2545.0)|
| 0:42:27| and all the firefighters quit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2547.0)|
| 0:42:29| some odd thousand people are going to look to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2549.0)|
| 0:42:32| and say, what are you doing about my fire protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2552.0)|
| 0:42:35| Same thing with the rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2555.0)|
| 0:42:36| Should somebody at AMR, who is their owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2556.0)|
| 0:42:39| one day decide we have eight fire agencies across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2559.0)|
| 0:42:43| that is not our core business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2563.0)|
| 0:42:45| We have 30,000 employees, but this is not our core business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2565.0)|
| 0:42:48| We're going to pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2568.0)|
| 0:42:50| 200,000 people are going to look to the mayor and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2570.0)|
| 0:42:52| what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2572.0)|
| 0:42:53| We actually do a little bit of contingency planning along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2573.0)|
| 0:42:56| One of the reasons, for instance, on some of the lease stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2576.0)|
| 0:42:59| there is a right of first refusal for Knox County to pick that lease up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2579.0)|
| 0:43:02| should we have a sudden and unexpected need for a fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2582.0)|
| 0:43:07| Again, I don't think it will ever happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2587.0)|
| 0:43:09| but contingency planning is part of our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2589.0)|
| 0:43:11| in order to maintain public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2591.0)|
| 0:43:13| Again, one of the reasons that we felt like it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2593.0)|
| 0:43:15| to have a public safety director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2595.0)|
| 0:43:17| Let me just say, fire protection is not free, and it never has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2597.0)|
| 0:43:21| If you're one of the folks that don't subscribe, you don't pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2601.0)|
| 0:43:24| and that is your prerogative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2604.0)|
| 0:43:26| but the bulk of it is being paid for by folks that do subscribe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2606.0)|
| 0:43:31| But it is not and has never been free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2611.0)|
| 0:43:33| So the question is, what does it look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2613.0)|
| 0:43:35| Our model is working. I think it works pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2615.0)|
| 0:43:37| We just think it can work better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:39| and we do think some accountability is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2619.0)|
| 0:43:42| Most of these relationships, Commissioner Ward, have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2622.0)|
| 0:43:45| We don't have a contract with Rural Metro, and we cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2625.0)|
| 0:43:48| without developing the Countywide Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2628.0)|
| 0:43:51| So if you ask me about the problems with the contract with Rural Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2631.0)|
| 0:43:53| there are none because no such agreement exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2633.0)|
| 0:43:56| We think that for an agency that provides fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2636.0)|
| 0:43:58| to 200,000 of our citizens, we need some formal written agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2638.0)|
| 0:44:02| That's true with Carnes and Seymour as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2642.0)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you. Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2647.0)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2651.0)|
| 0:44:12| I just wanted to express that I agree with Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2652.0)|
| 0:44:16| and Commissioner Ward of being good stewards of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2656.0)|
| 0:44:20| We just went through the budget where every dollar is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2660.0)|
| 0:44:24| and how we spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2664.0)|
| 0:44:27| You said we spend less than a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2667.0)|
| 0:44:29| That's still a lot of money, whether it be $1 short of a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2669.0)|
| 0:44:33| or $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2673.0)|
| 0:44:36| I just wanted to express that we are very conscious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2676.0)|
| 0:44:40| and don't spend more than where we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2680.0)|
| 0:44:44| and we spend tax dollars where it's the most needed for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2684.0)|
| 0:44:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2689.0)|
| 0:44:50| And just, again, for a little bit of context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2690.0)|
| 0:44:52| I think our peers in the city spend on the order of $38 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2692.0)|
| 0:44:56| on fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2696.0)|
| 0:45:00| Any more questions from Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2700.0)|
| 0:45:04| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2704.0)|
| 0:45:06| Madam Chair, could I just mention that Mr. Lauer is a dear, dear friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2706.0)|
| 0:45:12| His contract with CTAS actually ended a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2712.0)|
| 0:45:17| and he just saw this through of his own time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2717.0)|
| 0:45:22| and dedication to the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2722.0)|
| 0:45:24| We really, really appreciate that, both myself on behalf of the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2724.0)|
| 0:45:29| and Mr. Daley and I on behalf of Fire and Technical Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2729.0)|
| 0:45:32| When his contract ended, he could have told us thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2732.0)|
| 0:45:36| and handed us the incomplete report, but he chose not to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2736.0)|
| 0:45:39| saw it through, and we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2739.0)|
| 0:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2742.0)|
| 0:45:53| This brings us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2753.0)|
| 0:45:56| Per our rules, those who have signed up to speak on an agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2756.0)|

| 0:46:17| I don't see Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2777.0)|
| 0:46:22| Okay, that concludes our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2782.0)|
| 0:46:27| We'll move on to our next item, please, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2787.0)|
| 0:46:31| It's approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2791.0)|

| 0:46:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2802.0)|
| 0:46:43| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=2803.0)|

| 0:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3323.0)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you so much for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3324.0)|
| 0:55:26| Any questions that you have, I'm happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3326.0)|
| 0:55:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker, do you have a question for Miss Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3330.0)|
| 0:55:34| Well, I guess, yeah, several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3334.0)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3342.0)|
| 0:55:43| First off, it's my understanding that Clingman's Dome was named for a Democrat U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3343.0)|
| 0:55:53| Senator back in 1858.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3353.0)|
| 0:55:55| So 165 years ago, that's how Clingman's Dome arrived by its name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3355.0)|
| 0:56:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3362.0)|
| 0:56:04| So, since time immemorial, it has been named Kewohee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3364.0)|
| 0:56:11| There are plenty of historical maps that show the historical name as Kewohee, but you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3371.0)|
| 0:56:17| correct that it was renamed in 1858 after Thomas Clingman, who was a North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3377.0)|
| 0:56:24| senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3384.0)|
| 0:56:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3385.0)|
| 0:56:27| And then Blount County, Tennessee, who adjoins the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3387.0)|
| 0:56:37| not participated in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3397.0)|
| 0:56:42| So, to date, in Tennessee, we do have the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club, the Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3402.0)|
| 0:56:50| Infinite for Continued Learning, Oracle, and the Sierra Club of Tennessee, but Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3410.0)|
| 0:56:58| County would be the first county commission to lend its support to our cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3418.0)|
| 0:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3424.0)|
| 0:57:05| And then the Tennessee House of Representatives has not taken up this issue, and also my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3425.0)|
| 0:57:10| understanding that the Tennessee Senate has not addressed this issue either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3430.0)|
| 0:57:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3436.0)|
| 0:57:18| No, that is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3438.0)|
| 0:57:20| The Tennessee state legislator has issued their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3440.0)|
| 0:57:25| They have had a joint resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3445.0)|
| 0:57:30| Yes, supporting our efforts to restore the name of Kewohee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3450.0)|
| 0:57:36| They do have a joint resolution that has been ratified and signed by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3456.0)|
| 0:57:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3463.0)|
| 0:57:44| And then, previously, before you came on, there was a picture of Clingman's Dome, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3464.0)|
| 0:57:51| is recognized throughout not only the United States, but the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3471.0)|
| 0:57:55| So, how, for tourists and those things, what will they identify the observation platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3475.0)|
| 0:58:03| as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3483.0)|
| 0:58:06| Our intention is not to, this is not about the observation tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3486.0)|
| 0:58:12| The mountain itself is Kewohee, and that is the original name of the mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3492.0)|
| 0:58:18| However, the U.S. Board of Geographic Names or the park names the tower, that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3498.0)|
| 0:58:26| to be completely up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3506.0)|
| 0:58:29| Is that part of this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3509.0)|
| 0:58:32| The process is to restore the mountain's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3512.0)|
| 0:58:36| Okay, but in our resolution, we say the mountain, but we don't, there's no reference to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3516.0)|
| 0:58:43| not what is recognized throughout the world as Clingman's Dome, the observation tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3523.0)|
| 0:58:50| which is probably, and that's the highest point in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3530.0)|
| 0:58:55| I think that it will be up to maybe the park or the U.S. Board to see whether or not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3535.0)|
| 0:59:05| Clingman's Dome observation tower remains the observation tower name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3545.0)|
| 0:59:11| But for today, the intention is to support the restoration of the name Kewohee to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3551.0)|
| 0:59:20| mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3560.0)|
| 0:59:25| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3565.0)|
| 0:59:27| So, all right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3567.0)|
| 0:59:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3569.0)|
| 0:59:30| I think ultimately, the idea is that if, when the name is restored to Kewohee, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3570.0)|
| 0:59:41| observation tower could possibly be renamed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3581.0)|
| 0:59:46| But do you understand from an economic development and tourism standpoint, when you have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3586.0)|
| 0:59:53| that's known worldwide as Clingman's Dome, and then to change it to something else, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3593.0)|
| 0:59:59| just, it just, it just doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3599.0)|
| 1:00:04| Hey, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3604.0)|
| 1:00:07| We do feel, though, that this is an educational opportunity to not only talk about the indigenous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3607.0)|
| 1:00:13| people who once occupied the land and whose cultural history this is truly about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3613.0)|
| 1:00:21| It's a, it is an economic opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3621.0)|
| 1:00:26| People love the idea of learning more about indigenous people, visiting indigenous people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3626.0)|
| 1:00:34| A lot of people have ancestors that are Native American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3634.0)|
| 1:00:41| There's great economic opportunity with the name change, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3641.0)|
| 1:00:49| Okay, and then did you say that the Friends of the Smokies have endorsed this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3649.0)|
| 1:00:57| In North Carolina, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3657.0)|
| 1:01:01| There's two different divisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3661.0)|
| 1:01:04| There's a North Carolina and a Tennessee, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3664.0)|
| 1:01:10| So the North Carolina one's endorsed it, but the mountains in Tennessee, and they have not endorsed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3670.0)|
| 1:01:16| We have not asked the Friends of the Smokies in Tennessee for their endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3676.0)|
| 1:01:23| This has been a process, and like just scheduling, getting to all of these places has taken a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3683.0)|
| 1:01:30| little bit more time than we thought, but we do have many of the North Carolina counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3690.0)|
| 1:01:40| county commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3700.0)|
| 1:01:41| We have Andrews and Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3701.0)|
| 1:01:44| We have a joint venture with all of the counties surrounding Cherokee on the North Carolina side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3704.0)|
| 1:01:52| Again, coming to the Knox County Commission is one of our first stops on the Tennessee side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3712.0)|
| 1:02:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3721.0)|
| 1:02:03| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3723.0)|
| 1:02:05| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3725.0)|
| 1:02:07| Ms. Hill, thank you so much for being here, and for the commissioners who have signed on to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3727.0)|
| 1:02:15| Since we do have you here, I think it's important, if you can do it kind of in a little synopsis of what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3735.0)|
| 1:02:24| land actually means to the Cherokees, and why you guys feel like it is so important to be able to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3744.0)|
| 1:02:35| name back, and it is a great history lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3755.0)|
| 1:02:41| Before you do that really quick, because I don't want to forget this, right now we've got over 3,000 Native| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3761.0)|
| 1:02:47| Americans that live in our region, with nearly half of those are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3767.0)|
| 1:02:53| So I think Tennessee and Knox County is a great opportunity to be able to start, and then to know that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3773.0)|
| 1:03:00| legislature has signed on also, but I just wanted to be able to get that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3780.0)|

| 1:06:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3968.0)|
| 1:06:09| Did you say that you are working with the National Park, or you have not worked with the National Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3969.0)|
| 1:06:17| We have friends and connections with the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, and they are promoting education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3977.0)|
| 1:06:26| and they do refer to Clean Winds Dome as Kawohi because they want to be sensitive to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3986.0)|
| 1:06:36| They now have Kawohi Days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3996.0)|
| 1:06:38| They invite schools up to go to the mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=3998.0)|
| 1:06:42| They allow traditional practices to happen there, but it's all orchestrated through the park system themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4002.0)|
| 1:06:50| and so we are working with them, but they—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4010.0)|
| 1:07:00| Oh, and then a few weeks ago, they allowed Cherokee to partner with Yo-Yo Ma and have a performance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4020.0)|
| 1:07:11| So, the Park Service is helping with educational opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4031.0)|
| 1:07:17| Now, the Park Service is—who does the application? The Park Service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4037.0)|
| 1:07:22| No. In this instance, we're—me, a member of the Eastern Band, and my friend-slash-sister, Mary Crow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4042.0)|
| 1:07:32| we're going to do the application ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4052.0)|
| 1:07:35| It's two people. We're going to submit an application to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4055.0)|
| 1:07:41| and then they will determine, approve, or deny our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4061.0)|
| 1:07:47| Is the mountain itself named Clean Winds Mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4067.0)|
| 1:07:53| The whole mountain is actually named Clean Winds Dome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4073.0)|
| 1:07:57| It's confusing, though, because the observation tower is there on the top of the mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4077.0)|
| 1:08:02| So, we're not asking, rename that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4082.0)|
| 1:08:06| We're asking, restore the historical, cultural name, Kewokee, to the mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4086.0)|
| 1:08:16| Is this the only mountain, or are you going to go after Mount LeConte next, or which mountains is next on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4096.0)|
| 1:08:24| So, I don't have a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4104.0)|
| 1:08:28| I know that there are places that maybe other people have in mind, but I don't have a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4108.0)|
| 1:08:38| This is my goal. This is something that I've worked very hard on for eight months, and I will continue to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4118.0)|
| 1:08:47| So, this is it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4127.0)|
| 1:08:51| I don't understand why the Park Service is not behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4131.0)|
| 1:08:55| Why is not the Park Service behind you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4135.0)|
| 1:09:01| I think because they just don't take an official stance on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4141.0)|
| 1:09:07| If the U.S. Board on Geographic Names says, we approve this application, we're going to name it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4147.0)|
| 1:09:13| and then they'll do the work from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4153.0)|
| 1:09:16| But I don't think they're going to take a stance to support or oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4156.0)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4162.0)|

| 1:09:37| I think that's why it's so important for people to know the true history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4177.0)|
| 1:09:43| We are living in a time that certain states want to deny people's history and keep people from knowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4183.0)|
| 1:09:50| So, this is a great economic and community development opportunity for people to know who had the land first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4190.0)|
| 1:09:59| Continue to do your work. I am praying for you and standing with you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4199.0)|

| 1:12:14| I'm happy to forward a copy of that. I do have a picture of it on my Facebook account with Mary Crow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4334.0)|
| 1:12:25| Representative Justin Jones did mail that to us. So, we have the fully signed thing, a document, but the document number, what was the document number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4345.0)|
| 1:12:36| HR, you said? The document number is 452. But I am more than happy to email a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4356.0)|
| 1:12:51| I can send it to Court because I do have her email address and then she could share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4371.0)|
| 1:13:00| Thank you, Ms. Hill. That would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4380.0)|
| 1:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4383.0)|
| 1:13:05| Commissioners, I also want to add that we are, since we are the first stop, we are the only county commission that has taken this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4385.0)|
| 1:13:14| However, we are not the only ones that will be considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4394.0)|
| 1:13:18| For example, County Commission in Campbell County will be bringing it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4398.0)|
| 1:13:24| One of their commissioners will be bringing it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4404.0)|
| 1:13:26| A very similar resolution, if not the same, with just name changes as far as which commission is adopting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4406.0)|
| 1:13:34| So, that will be going forward in July in Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4414.0)|
| 1:13:39| And again, this is not, as Ms. Hill has said, this is not the first mountain that has been renamed or restored back to its original name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4419.0)|
| 1:13:50| Previously, Denali was Mount McKinley and now it is Denali in Denali National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4430.0)|
| 1:13:58| And so this is not something out of the ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4438.0)|
| 1:14:02| This is just a restoration of that prior history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4442.0)|
| 1:14:07| And so all this does is just say we support their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4447.0)|
| 1:14:11| Whether or not they get it, that's up to the U.S. Geological Board and naming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4451.0)|
| 1:14:16| So, that's all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4456.0)|
| 1:14:19| Is there any more discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4459.0)|
| 1:14:25| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4465.0)|
| 1:14:34| All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4474.0)|
| 1:14:37| Any opposed? That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4477.0)|
| 1:14:40| Ms. Hill, thank you so much and go Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4480.0)|

| 1:14:48| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4488.0)|
| 1:14:50| This is a work session, so next week is your actual council meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4490.0)|
| 1:14:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4496.0)|
| 1:14:58| Should I be there for that? I'm happy to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4498.0)|

| 1:15:07| But we could both be there next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4507.0)|
| 1:15:10| I will be in touch, but if you could, that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4510.0)|

| 1:15:29| Commissioners, Jane Bird is here with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4529.0)|
| 1:15:33| We're going to go back to 50 so she can explain what the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4533.0)|
| 1:15:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker to hopefully answer your question regarding that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4537.0)|
| 1:15:42| Hello. Good evening. I'm Jane Bird with the Public Building Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4542.0)|
| 1:15:46| 400 West Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4546.0)|
| 1:15:49| I'm sorry. We had a PBA board meeting, so I couldn't be here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4549.0)|
| 1:15:53| But this assignment and assumption of the lease is specific to Nexus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4553.0)|
| 1:15:59| Nexus is a networking group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4559.0)|
| 1:16:01| They have servers and things in the Summer Place facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4561.0)|
| 1:16:04| So if you're using their system, we badge you so that you can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4564.0)|
| 1:16:10| and check should your server go down and something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4570.0)|
| 1:16:13| They are selling to a group called Peace Communication, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4573.0)|
| 1:16:18| They're out of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4578.0)|
| 1:16:20| And I sent Chris and Charlie the financial statements from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4580.0)|
| 1:16:24| and we did a study on them, and they seem like a good, solid company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4584.0)|
| 1:16:28| So this is just a transfer of the current lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4588.0)|
| 1:16:31| It will be up in 2025, and we can look at any renewals or changes at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4591.0)|
| 1:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4597.0)|

| 1:17:42| Is there a requirement for having a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4662.0)|

| 1:17:50| Trustee Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4670.0)|

| 1:17:57| Justin Biggs, Knox County Trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4677.0)|
| 1:17:59| Yes, sir, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4679.0)|
| 1:18:01| By state law, this is a resolution of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4681.0)|
| 1:18:03| We have to have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4683.0)|
| 1:18:05| and then the actual vote on this resolution will be next month in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4685.0)|

| 1:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4698.0)|
| 1:18:22| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4702.0)|
| 1:18:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4704.0)|
| 1:18:26| Mr. Trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4706.0)|
| 1:18:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4708.0)|
| 1:18:30| Explain the program to us and to the public, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4710.0)|
| 1:18:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4712.0)|
| 1:18:34| CPACER was enacted in 2021 in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4714.0)|
| 1:18:36| It's in 32 other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4716.0)|
| 1:18:38| We were looking at some of our delinquent properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4718.0)|
| 1:18:41| and some of the properties we previously sold in our tax sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4721.0)|
| 1:18:44| specifically commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4724.0)|
| 1:18:46| We were noticing that some of those commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4726.0)|
| 1:18:49| were still blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4729.0)|
| 1:18:51| They hadn't been cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4731.0)|
| 1:18:53| There were still eyesores to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4733.0)|
| 1:18:55| so we got in touch with a group of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4735.0)|
| 1:18:58| and saw if there was any programs we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4738.0)|
| 1:19:00| to see what we could move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4740.0)|
| 1:19:02| with those blighted properties being cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4742.0)|
| 1:19:04| CPACER got brought to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4744.0)|
| 1:19:06| Memphis, as well as Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4746.0)|
| 1:19:08| is already on the program here in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4748.0)|
| 1:19:10| and we started talking about what it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4750.0)|
| 1:19:12| the direction it could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4752.0)|
| 1:19:14| So we were solely based on the blighted property portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4754.0)|
| 1:19:17| and then we saw that there was another component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4757.0)|
| 1:19:19| for new construction as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4759.0)|
| 1:19:21| What CPACER does is it allows banks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4761.0)|
| 1:19:25| and the people that are actually going into the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4765.0)|
| 1:19:28| purchase the property, to take out a separate note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4768.0)|
| 1:19:30| so that way they can go in and clean up the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4770.0)|
| 1:19:33| if they take the proper precautions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4773.0)|
| 1:19:35| of the financial build options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4775.0)|
| 1:19:37| that are intact with CPACER as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4777.0)|
| 1:19:40| It does say clean energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4780.0)|
| 1:19:42| but there is a lot of things that would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4782.0)|
| 1:19:44| to be included in the CPACER program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4784.0)|
| 1:19:46| for some of these specific areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4786.0)|
| 1:19:48| that would really help clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4788.0)|
| 1:19:50| some of the eyesores that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4790.0)|
| 1:19:52| Would that include the Smoky Mountains smelter site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4792.0)|
| 1:19:57| or Witherspoons or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4797.0)|
| 1:19:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4799.0)|
| 1:20:01| Yeah, as well as some of these gas stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4801.0)|
| 1:20:03| that you see that have been owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4803.0)|
| 1:20:05| by people that may not live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4805.0)|
| 1:20:07| that have become eyesores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4807.0)|
| 1:20:09| Those would be able to be cleaned up under this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4809.0)|
| 1:20:11| and some of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4811.0)|
| 1:20:13| may be out further in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4813.0)|
| 1:20:15| We have a lot of pallets and tiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4815.0)|
| 1:20:17| so hopefully this benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4817.0)|
| 1:20:19| and it's another thing that draws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4819.0)|
| 1:20:21| to fill up our industrial parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4821.0)|
| 1:20:23| Midwade Road, Carnes Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4823.0)|
| 1:20:25| or Hardin Valley and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4825.0)|
| 1:20:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4827.0)|
| 1:20:29| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4829.0)|
| 1:20:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4831.0)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4833.0)|
| 1:20:35| Mr. Trustee, how are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4835.0)|
| 1:20:37| I'm well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4837.0)|
| 1:20:39| So does your office then classify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4839.0)|
| 1:20:41| that commercial business in the CPACER program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4841.0)|
| 1:20:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4843.0)|
| 1:20:45| And then after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4845.0)|
| 1:20:47| it's administered through us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4847.0)|
| 1:20:49| with the bank of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4849.0)|
| 1:20:51| We've already met with several banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4851.0)|
| 1:20:53| If this program's passed in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4853.0)|
| 1:20:55| we're going to hold a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4855.0)|
| 1:20:57| in the small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4857.0)|
| 1:20:59| with the area banks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4859.0)|

| 1:22:15| and I'm wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4935.0)|
| 1:22:17| I put it at 4.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-2300620?start=4937.0)|
