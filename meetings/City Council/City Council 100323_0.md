| 0:06:37| The reason being that it seems like daily there's new information coming about this and I'm not I will need more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=404)|

| 0:07:07| Mr. Grieve is this a comment on that? Yes. Okay in terms of postponing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| one of the things too is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Like councilman Palmer says it seems like we're getting new information and for us new folks that in fact vice mayor Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| I wouldn't mind having another workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| on this particular issue with the sector plan if that's possible and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| You know whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Six weeks or eight weeks or whatever if it would be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Maybe not all the council members want to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| But I know myself in terms of the information that keeps coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| I'd like to be better versed on this if that's if that's at all possible. So I would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| More than two weeks in order to have a possible another workshop on that. Mr. Pavlos. Yeah, I too would support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| I think that the county's going to have a workshop on it as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| I think they postponed it from their agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| May be wrong they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Pretty sure they did so I would support the postponement as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| the further the 10-week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=489)|

| 0:08:23| Mr. Donaldson, can you explain to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| our significance and how it plays into the chain of events and the sequence of events and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| When would that our decision really become relevant to the them moving forward or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| I mean, what's the county have to do and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| met yesterday County Commission and did postpone their consideration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| requested that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Chairman of the Commission Strickland's set up a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| As far as I know that date has not been set yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Their direction was to try to get it done within the month so that they could consider it again in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=542)|
| 0:09:12| Ultimately, you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| Current sector plan that is in place stays in place until it's replaced by the update that's been adopted by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| the role of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| legislative body is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| either pass or not pass the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| update as adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| The role of the municipality is to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| their portion of the update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| That would be the area within the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Thank you, and I guess it miss Raj wants to what okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Well, they can do it or we can hear council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Well, let me hear from the other council members who have lights and then we'll go to them. Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Miss Ronnie. Yes, vice mayor Becker in in regards to councilman Greaves request for a follow-up workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| Would it be appropriate to contact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Chairman Strickland and find out if we would be welcome at that workshop and maybe some of this additional information might be gleaned there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| You know rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Duplicating folks time on both sides of this issue and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| So I would ask if you could respectfully ask if you could explore that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Secondly, I know that there are folks here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| on both sides of this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| And I'd like to hear from maybe one representative from from each group and ask how the 10-week postponement would affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| Their position relative to the two-week postponement, please. It'd be great and you can do it. Whoever would like to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=630)|

| 0:10:49| based on all the meetings that I've attended and workshops has to do with the development of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| business park at Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=654)|

| 0:11:00| sector plan for 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Had a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| We need to know where we're going and it just seems like to continue to delay and delay is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| We need an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| So that so we can make some decisions and I don't know how much more information can be out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| I would feel certain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| the workshops that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| County Commission's going to hold would be open to the public and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| they would be very agreeable to that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| So we would ask that you not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Postpone this for 10 weeks. I don't think it's going to take that long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| To get whatever questions you've got answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=698)|

| 0:12:43| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| 10 weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Realized I saw the facial expressions when when you made that proposal miss Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Understand that you don't want to drag on but by the same token these guys have been trying to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| I'm talking about the Development Corporation been trying to do this for for 10 years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| There's been a lot go on in 10 years and we'd like you to know about that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| the County Commission workshop once once again, it's going to be two hours and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| And as you know with the presentations 45 minutes of it was gone and then you had 10-15 minutes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| information that you could glean and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| By the time you ask questions, it's gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| It's just it's just a humongous amount of information to try to get in a couple of hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| We'd like an opportunity to get in front of you guys again, too. But it once again, we're at your pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| I'd like to offer another substitute motion and that is to postpone for four weeks rather than two or ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| to allow time for the County Commission workshop to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| take place to allow time for the district councilman to return and then after four weeks if we still feel like there's additional information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| We need to digest then we could postpone again at that point, but I didn't hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| Either those who are for or against this item petition strongly for the for the 10 weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| And maybe four weeks is is more of a middle ground to try to get this resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| I'll second. Okay, mr. Vice mayor Becker. Okay. Um, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Two things maybe three on one. It's kind of cool how I learned something new every day and and mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| He was interesting. Mr. Wolfenbarger approached me at the beginning meeting and said we'd like to do another workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| And I said the council's and council's never going to do that. And I think it's really cool that we do that. That's uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| That's a that's a great thing to learn that council is now open to more than one workshop on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| So I'll remember that for the rest of my time in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| I tend to worry a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| About things dragging on because I think mr. Bailey had a really good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| Most of the discussion on this is focusing on the Midway Road and Dust Bowl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| But the truth is there are also a lot of other things in there and and some of which mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| Donaldson correct me if I'm wrong when we adopt it. We have added some additional protections to Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| So I think there is a value in the stuff outside of Asheville getting adopted in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| I like miss Roddy suggestion of a four-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| It allows us to figure out what the county's doing. Can we piggyback on their workshop? Do we need to have our own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| And it does allow the two council members who are not here to to voice their opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| So I think that sounds like an excellent an excellent compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Let's see. I'm going to go to mr. Brown. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Just want to comment on the possibility of a joint workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| I think that would be a good thing if it can be done because it's basically the same information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| Mr. Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| I agree with councilman Roddy that four weeks seems reasonable and I appreciate councilman Palmer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| Wanting to thoroughly investigate this, but if there is the need and we realize we don't have all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| We could again postpone it. Thank you. I'm mr. Grief. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| We could again postpone it thank you, uh, mr. Grief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| I was I was going to say the the four weeks are fine. I just want to make it clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| As far as a new council person coming on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| There's been an awful lot of information on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| And I think we've had one workshop and i'm not so sure that that one workshop that really both sides, you know got to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Everything that that's now coming forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| And I think this is such a crucial decision about what's happening in east knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| And what's happening with what lane we have left that I want to be sure that i'm well informed in a decision that I make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| And also what i'm concerned about is that what i'm getting inundated with is midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| And the east sector plan just like councilman becker said is more than just midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| And so I think we have some other things that are kind of being pushed to the side that we need to be sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| We are at least that I need to be sure that i'm well informed of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| I would hope that I have no problem with a with another workshop and a joint workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| I think that's a good idea with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| However, if it's the same workshop that we already had then we're not going to be able to get additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| Plus I think that with everything that's come forward so far that that I personally have a number of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| That I'd like to share with the other council members and be able to talk to both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| And so that's why i'm pushing for some type of of a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| On that. Thank you mayor. Thank you vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| Um clearly, uh, this is a process question. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| And it's actually councilman grieve raises a good point to doing what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| Two weeks ago, um, you know with the workshop isn't uh, isn't what we need. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Swanson, um sunshine law question since the agenda of a workshop is a process question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| I'm allowed to have conversations with my fellow council members to kind of get it with what mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Grieve would like to see at this and to to to contact people and say what is it that needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| To be answered at it. Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| uh, you can have conversations with regard to procedural issues and that would be a procedural issue as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| What's going to be on the agenda of the workshop you may not discuss with your colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| Any of the issues related to what's going to be on the agenda? All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| um it it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| It sounds like there is interest in longer discussion on this and does council, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| Trust me to go ahead and contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Mr. Strickland see if there is a joint workshop and then to do some of the discussions about what it is we need and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| make some recommendations about whether what the county is doing is going to answer our concerns because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| They they actually have not had a single workshop. So theirs could potentially be what ours was before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| um, and that's sort of a very broad question people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| Speak up if they have strong opinions. Mr. Pavlis. I do have an opinion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| I mean, I know what our last dinner when we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| procedurally our workshops that we decided to have them on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| On the workshop day. So I mean i'm all about and I think it'd be great if we could work it out to have it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| Joining with the county but but we all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Those that represent a district have obligations within our district and I know we're all diligent in attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| the various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| association meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| um in our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| So, you know, perhaps we might want to get a couple of dates and look at that and with the preference being towards the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1177)|
| 0:19:45| Uh workshop night, but then you know if it works out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| If you just wanted to go to the county workshop, then that might be you know an option as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| Mr. Grave, uh, the only concern that I have is that i'm not sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| We can mobilize and get get it all together in four weeks and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| I'd hate to I'd hate to say at the end of four weeks all of a sudden we come back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| We have the same discussion and say we need another two weeks or three weeks. So let's go six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| Amend the amended amended amended motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Right now we only have one amendment on the floor. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| You're only amending this first amendment, uh, miss palmer. I'll come back to you. Go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| I'll withdraw the 10 weeks and support the six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Okay, can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Could that be a second to his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Miss ronnie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Um, this is in response to council member pavlis's concerns about scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| Um, I suppose there's a possibility that county commission might choose to have their workshop during the day since they meet during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| I don't know how that affects council members obligations to community groups in in the evenings and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| You know for those who have other obligations during the day, that might be a problem as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| I don't know. But anyway, that certainly is is out there and i'm sure vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Becker can handle all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Okay, the motion on the floor is for six weeks right now. Mr. Wolfhard would you like to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Mr. Graves made a point and then I had an observation just I don't know that you all considered it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| If you want to ask questions in a two-hour meeting, there's 19 council commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Then then the city council, I mean, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Just an observation. I was sitting there and I think oh god, that's an awful lot of people trying to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| um to pursue information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Thanks, okay, the motion on the floor is to postpone for six weeks. Is there any additional comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Right now we don't know the the date of the county's workshop, right? Okay. Okay. All right. All those in favor. Aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1304)|

| 0:22:35| You'd have to have five votes because it's procedural issue a simple majority will suffice. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| That's important to know for the rest of the night, by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Okay, if I can as a vice mayor, I actually I wanted a a little more sense on what people were thinking. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1362)|
| 0:22:51| We have uh postponed now and there's been a lot of talk of how we do a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| But three people just voted against that. So I guess at some level it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| There's still a procedural step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| and I think what it needs to be miss mitchell is for you to send out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| Email asking council members whether they want a workshop and I think procedurally we have to have five people saying they want a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| Before that can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| um now that doesn't preclude a briefing of some kind but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| A workshop has a an official an official connotation to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| And if you can do that before we start all this trying to schedule with the county, uh, that would be helpful. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| Mr. Gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Is is there a reason you have to have five for a workshop is that code says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| No, actually, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Use the vice mayor as a single vice mayor can call for a workshop. Not everybody has to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Nobody has to show up and if I don't call for a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| Then your colleagues could throw you out and vote for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Please don't tell mr. Becker. He has this much power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1442)|
| 0:24:02| Well, no, the reason I ask it is that that again a number of us folks that have just really gotten involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| Would like to have the opportunity to really ask questions and and more so just on a one-on-one basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| I mean, it's it's it's rather difficult to take all these telephone calls and ask the same questions and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Myself through the workshops that we've had that i've learned a lot from you folks my fellow colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| In terms of what you've been through for the last couple of years on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| And I just think it would be good that now whether or not you all show up that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| But I would certainly like to have the opportunity to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Both sides present and really have the opportunity to ask questions and get those answers while both parties are present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| Instead of this telephone calling back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| so what the counselor is saying is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| He can call a workshop and two people can show up or one or none. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| Miss running, um, thank you. Mr. Becker. I would ask that um, if you choose not to exercise your special power and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| You choose to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Sounds like he goes to hogwarts now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| And you do have a miss mitchell poll our group if for some reason there is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| a compelling majority that desires a second workshop if you would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Um interface with county commission and and perhaps in lieu of a council workshop those who were interested in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| Could could attend in in whatever informal capacity as mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Wolfenbacher said certainly that will be open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| And um, you know, the discussion may go a different direction than ours did and new information might be revealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| Mr. Becker it feels like there's a an even better solution. Um, it sounds like proceeding with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| Uh, I was thinking about before we had the very split vote on the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| Uh makes sense to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| We should work out what people are concerned about. Um, and this sounds like we being me in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| Um what people are concerned about can that be dealt with in a joint session with the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Um, and if not scheduling one and it feels like there's at least enough interest in people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| Um that I can use my special power to uh to call something. Um, which is wonderful to know I have you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| That might come back to haunt you someday, um, so i'll move forward with that and uh, uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| Try and get something that will get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| My gut just says that this probably is not something we do jointly with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| I have a feeling that since we've already done a session they have and I think that point of 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| County commissioners none of whom like to talk. Um, uh indicates that we might want to do something special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| And it might be valuable for it to be small and I will endeavor to set that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| Rhonda rice 17 market square. Um, knoxville chamber of commerce just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| For your information the vote that county commission passed last night and it might help in your scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| Is that they postpone the vote to the next county commission meeting and are trying to schedule a workshop within 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| So just for your knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Thanks helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Okay, let's see. We've had the vote. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Okay, let's see any other items dealing. We're still dealing with the agenda believe it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Yes, mr. Gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Uh, mr. Mayor, I really thought our meeting was going to go pretty quickly tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1637)|

| 0:27:41| If you would let me know that that would be helpful. Um, they're all these are all dealing with closing alleys and some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| Um, mayor, mr. Green and I talked about this. I don't know that he's putting on consent, but rather just consolidating right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| I'll deal with the same right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Yeah, but I think the motion is to I want to see because we're dealing with all together if there's anybody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1676)|

| 0:28:23| Okay, mr. Becker. Is that on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=1703)|

| 0:38:28| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Two questions I have on this and and again, this is for information purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| Uh on on a project like this where we have the public building authority. What's our what's our relationship with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| Pba in terms of how how that works. Do we not go out and look at other management contractors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| uh in terms of doing any kind of work and then the second question I have is does the pba use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| state fee schedule for architects and engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| Steve, do you know the second actually you can answer either one if you want, but the second one i'm not certain of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| Uh, no, I don't think I don't think pba nor the city uses the state schedule we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| either one of us would negotiate a price with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Professional consultant has the designer been selected for this project? Yes already. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| So the price the fee has already been negotiated. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Okay, then what about pba as far as what's our relationship with pba in terms of being the management contractor on a job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| historically, we've used pba for uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| building top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2372)|

| 0:39:37| uh roof projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| It's really on a case-by-case basis some some of the projects we will do in-house. We will contract with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| an engineer architect directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2386)|

| 0:40:25| Mr. Gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Thank you mayor again. I have a question on this is something like this. Does this ever go out for public bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| Instead of just going to pba. I think I can answer that. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| Agreement with pba to help manage all of the the city's parking facilities right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| So this is just an extension of that. In fact previously pba| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Uh wasn't was uh was not involved in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| We had a bid that went to the actual operating of garages and so forth that that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| That that did go out for bid, but this is managing at one another level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Is that is that something that's done every couple of years or or as far as managing the parking lots and the garages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Miss roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| I have a follow-up question for dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I'm wondering how pba came up with their numbers in terms of the annual operating costs for this parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| And whether or not we have any idea whether the usage of the lot will cover those expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| Right hannah. Do you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| I think I can can deal with the second part while she comes up that is if it turns out that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| We don't have the demand for that lot that we think that that we will have based on present use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| We could obviously scale back what we'd want them to do or even eliminate if it wasn't necessary to a lower fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| But i'll let i'll let hannah s answer the first part of the charge in which genesis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| i'll try to anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| um the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| The public building authority provided us with a projected operating budget. We took that to city finance and explored whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| how many parkers it would take to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| to essentially cover the operating costs and we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| That the projections are fair the lots full all the time now and that the rate will be such that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| That we will be able to cover the costs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| So the financial analysis came came out to to the positive and I assume this is not that i've seen these costs do not cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| um an attended lot with an attendant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| How will the how will it work will there be a gate with an arm and you how do you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| Correct. It will be a um a multi-metered kiosk essentially. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| One of the the only other lot I think downtown that has this is not a publicly owned lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| It's the one next to the beiju| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| And this will be the first city-owned garage without an attendant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| And so we're kind of going to try it as a pilot possibly implementing it on the 100 block later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| But it will be kind of a pay-as-you-go system that won't require you to take a ticket back and put it on your dash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| It's all electronic. Okay, and um one more question for the public that might be listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| Um, do you have to have cash or a certain type of coin or can you use a credit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100323?start=2587)|
