| 0:04:01| I cannot think of anyone more deserving of this recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=241)|

| 0:12:12| I had included, I know the search committee came up with the interview schedule for our candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| and I placed in page 38 and 39, but I know you all have updated that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| So, Madam Chairman, I don't know if you want the search committee to review that schedule at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| So, yes, we have the same schedule as here on your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| There weren't any changes from the discussion that we had Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| Did anything come up within these last 48 hours that we need to look at or change from the schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=759)|
| 0:12:48| I move that we adopt the recommended schedule from the search committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| for the candidate interview on February 17th and 18th of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Madam Chairman, I would ask if you or someone would call these finalists either tonight or first thing in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=795)|
| 0:13:23| obviously to congratulate them on being a finalist, but to go over the schedule, work out their travel plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| and if they need hotel accommodations for those that are out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| If you could please turn to page 30 in your notebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| We provided some things I think would be very useful for you as a board to review prior to interviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| They're just some interviewing tips for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| And then starting on page 35, there's equal opportunity employment guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=830)|
| 0:14:00| and I strongly suggest you read those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| There are certain questions you cannot ask during an interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| and if you could review those before your interviews begin on February 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| And then on page 40, during the interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| I think it would be good for you to have copies of this candidate reaction form for those that are in the audience that are observing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| that they can make their comments about each candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| I think it's good for the board just to, you know, hear what the public thinks about each of your candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| so you could have that form available during your interviews, which are conducted in an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| I think I'll turn it over to the chairman or the search committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| We had provided you with a sample interview guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| and I'll turn it over to the search committee to let the board know what you all decided to do with those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| and I think you may have some of your own, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Yeah, I had one question for Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| When you're talking about, I'm looking on page 40, about this candidate reaction form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| I think the way you said it was kind of when we did the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| This was for community members to fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Are you then suggesting there's a way that these get back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| I guess that's the part I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Just turn it back to the board, and if the board wants to look through those, just to get, it's nothing you need to tabulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| It's just strictly just to get a feel of what people are thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Ultimately, it's your decision, but it's found to be useful just to get a feel of how people reacted to each of the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=934)|
| 0:15:44| Okay, so kind of have these available at the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| People who want to fill them out can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Yeah, if they don't, it's okay, but you don't need to have your board secretary or anybody tabulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| Just have them available for the board to look through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| I guess I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Obviously, we've been handed a ton of information about these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Do you feel like on the tabs 1, 2, and 3, the suggestion is we go back and look at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| and this will give us a good idea about the candidates looking through this, free them coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| Absolutely, and you need to review their information prior to the interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I make a motion that we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| I make a motion that the candidates will have the sample interview questions to create a 20-minute presentation as well as, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=991)|
| 0:16:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Can I just do it all at once, or should I break it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| I make a motion that the candidates have the sample interview questions provided by Tennessee School Board Associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| to create a 20-minute presentation for their interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| So would you like for us to email the finalists the interview guide that we created?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| Yes, and have them create a 20-minute presentation answering those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| And I'll do that, but when the chairman or someone calls them, you need to review all that with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| so they'll be prepared for their interview day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| We can send that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Would it be easier if we send it when we call them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| Either way, you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Terry has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Yes, and Madam Chair, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Board members, what you have in front of you is TSBA's sample interview guide with some edits that Mr. Watson suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| So you may want to look at his red line revisions to see if you want to accept those along with the sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| And Ms. Horne, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Well, that's what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| I just want to know what you guys are proposing because we have two different things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| I removed the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Do we have a second to look over this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Yes, to look over this, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Take the motion off the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| I think it might be good if you all, the search committee, maybe review the interviews, the 17th and 18th with the board, how that day is going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1088)|
| 0:18:24| I think it might be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Think that would be good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Have they seen it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Oh, you've already talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Then we can move right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Everyone was good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| So what we're reviewing right now, board members, is the updated sample interview guide with the recommendations from board member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1121)|
| 0:18:56| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I make a motion that we accept what Dr. Grissom is presenting with this packet in our notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1138)|
| 0:19:11| So you are recommending, just to be clear, the original version of what Dr. Grissom, so there's a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1151)|
| 0:19:22| Correct, the one that's in the notebook that we looked at on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| And there's also another copy in the notebook as well tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| In the side pocket, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| So we have a motion on the floor by Ms. Horne to accept the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| Daniel, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| So we have the motion by Ms. Horne and a second by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| And Mr. Watson, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| Can somebody repeat the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| I'm not hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| I don't know if Terry can state it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| I don't know which mic we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Yes, Mr. Watson, the motion was made by Ms. Horne to accept the original version of the TSBA interview guide for the candidate's 20-minute presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1198)|
| 0:20:13| So what is the second version that you're referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| So we had a copy of the red line revisions that you had made for Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| Okay, that wasn't necessarily meant for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| That was just simply some wordsmithing suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| I don't ‑‑ yeah, I was not intending to bring that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1229)|
| 0:20:46| Yeah, I just think there needs to be some clarification when we talk to these candidates about 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| Like, are we expecting them just to speak to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Are we expecting a PowerPoint presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| I think just some guidance so that all three have very clear parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| and are coming in under the same kind of guidelines of what our expectation is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Because I think just saying we want a 20‑minute presentation is a little vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| Yeah, so I had a conversation with Dr. Grissom, and we will also call the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| But the conversation that I have with Dr. Grissom to tell the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| is that they will have 20 minutes to present the answers to these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| And so we will not engage during those 20 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| and their presentation should have us flowing from criteria one, criteria two, criteria three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| and we will be able to answer as they present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| So my expectation is when they're presenting that they will be able to walk us through these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure we kind of gave them some clarity on what our expectation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| So when you all call them in the morning, you need to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| That concludes my report. Let's see if someone has some questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1314)|
| 0:22:05| So we have a motion on the floor by Ms. Warren, a second by Ms. Bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| to accept the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| And any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1339)|

| 0:22:26| All right, so motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1346)|

| 0:22:51| This is for the process of live interview conversation, live interview questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1384)|

| 0:25:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| 8F, Approved First Reading of New Knox County Board of Education Policy C-260,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| Equity in Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I'd like to make a motion to send this policy back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| So a motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| I'd like to make a friendly amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| Okay, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| I would like to make the, that we would send it back to our March policy review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| and identify a particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| The reason I'm suggesting this is I know that we've talked about the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| in his retirement and that's bringing in a new leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| We also need to remember that by mid-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| we're also going to have at least three new board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| And depending on what happens with elections, that could change even beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Not saying that anybody wants to see that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| but we know at least three of our board members have opted not to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| And so I think it's important for this particular group to take this effort up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| and that it not be moved out beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1606)|
| 0:26:55| So I'll revise the motion to say I'd like to move policy C-260,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| equity and education to be reviewed in the March policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| A motion by Ms. Owen and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| I do have public forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Ms. Kelly, do we have a date on the calendar for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| It's March 23rd at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| After I listened to the speakers the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| I kept hearing people talk about all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| and I was thinking about the fact that so many of our policies say all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| and, in fact, specify a listing of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| So just in going through this proposed policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| there are, I think the issue is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| as Ms. Owen raised the question the other night about unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| and just some of the issues I believe are that we have specific policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| that speak to most every single part of this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| So I think that's an issue with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| It is trying to put, I literally have gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| it's trying to put a lot of different policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| and kind of summarize these policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| and I feel like that's where we could end up with unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| So, for instance, policy I-270 is directly spoken to in the very first opening paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1710)|
| 0:28:39| In lines 10 through 13, we have J-100, J-110, J-210, J-111, J-460, J-330, J-370, J-430, I-100, I-150, I-160,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1719)|
| 0:28:55| that all speak directly to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| Lines 15 through 25, roughly that paragraph, we have I-290, which is an ELL service policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1740)|
| 0:29:16| We also have our welcome center that we fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| We have C-100, D-100, I-190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| We have I-370, we have I-432.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| I think you can look at what our district's spending is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| our budget by district to see that there are variations in what is spent as far as our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1773)|
| 0:29:44| And then I think if you look at the seven things that are listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| decreasing absenteeism, that's J-120, reducing suspension rates and expulsion rates, J-191 and J-193,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1788)|
| 0:29:57| we've talked about extensively with regard to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Three, that's addressed by the Ford Next Generation Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| The next one is addressed by I-290.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| The next one is addressed by G-290, G-300, G-260, G-270.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| The sixth one is addressed in the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| The seventh one has been addressed in the DEO now with a new name, Alliance name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1818)|
| 0:30:29| So I think that's the issue, and I think that's why there are so many questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| because you're trying to take all these policies and put them into one policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| where we have a plethora of policies that lays this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| because this is throughout all of these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So I think that's the issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| So honestly, I'm not sure we need a policy, because we have this in all these policies that I've noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| So I think that we should probably just go ahead and vote on this, because we have this in all of these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| And I'm happy to send, this is like just my chicken scratch handwriting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| but I'm happy to send an email with what I have so that everybody can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| And this, I didn't read through policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| I mean, I did a pretty quick little overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| This was not an extensive search, so there's probably more that I don't have on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| I know Ms. Owen noted the fact that we have, there were probably seven or eight or nine policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| that specifically speak to equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| So I feel like we're trying to take an issue and put it into one policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| that's going to then create more work for the staff to try to get all this into one policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1897)|
| 0:31:46| when we have it throughout our entire policy manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| So in my opinion, we just need to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and we can look at these policies and see if there's an issue with some of these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| that you don't feel like it's being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| I'd like to respond, but it's hard for me here to know if I can get the floor or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| I appreciate you offering your notes, and I'll be glad to send mine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| And I think if we can look at all of those policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| one thing that I addressed with some folks in the community who had a concern—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| I think Mr. Watson's having a hard time hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Can I get any louder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I can get really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Use your teacher voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| I think what we're trying to do is work—we're working a little backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| We're making an umbrella policy to incorporate all of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| And I think putting it out to March 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| that gives us plenty of time to look at those and see if there are conflicting policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| And I think a reduction in the language would also make it broad enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| that we can ensure that it doesn't conflict with those other policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| So I think being able to look at those and reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| and make sure that all of the language matches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| I think by March 23rd we can easily do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| and especially with those notes that you've already produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| and with the policies, the ones that are specific to equity that I've pulled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| the ones that you've pulled out that say all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| and then we can pull others if other board members have others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| and just really make sure that if we are creating this sort of umbrella policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2013)|
| 0:33:43| to be sure the community understands our purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| that it also matches everything that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Yes. First, let me apologize for not being there in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| You all don't want me there. I'm feeling pretty crummy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| So I appreciate your patience. I'm really only hearing about every other word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| so I know I may not be speaking directly to the essence of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| but I did hear a little bit of what Ms. Owen had to say and what Ms. Warren had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| I do want to remind the board that the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| in our policy review meeting on November 17th took time at the end of that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| to share that the administration was going to be working toward an equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| At that time in that meeting, nobody on the board suggested that we should wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| or it wasn't the right timing or that we need to do some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| So I think the superintendent acted in good faith and pursued that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| and had after sharing with the board that that was their his intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| I'm hearing a little bit about referencing different policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| and I know we have lots of cross references in our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Certainly there is more work that needs to be done on the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| And I think a good place to have a good conversation about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| about the need for it and or how it might work would be in a policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| I think to I think based on our conversation on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| and also hearing from the community and hearing from several folks last on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| who have been involved in this work for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I even know that Rosa Marr was there, but I don't think she got to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| She left early. She's the current co-chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| I think given what we're hearing from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| it would be worth the board's time to investigate this further in policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| and give it the time that it deserves. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| Senator Fielding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| I want to thank you, Board Member Horne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| for doing that additional work within the last 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| because I didn't even know that it was infused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| And so I think that that, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| speaks to the commitment Knox County Schools has to equity throughout the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| And I also think that this is a perfect opportunity to not put the labor of searching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| for where equity is on our community, our parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| that we can just have one policy and reference the different policies for each notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| that you pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| So one policy versus all these other policies that are found within Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| I'm not a parent, but if a parent needed to come advocate for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| that they can go to that one particular equity and education policy that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| referencing all of the other policies within Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| So even if it's just a matter of this policy is combining where equity is infused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| throughout Knox County Schools, I think that that is a great start to build upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| So we already have the foundation from what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| I'm sure Board Member Owens will do a whole bunch more research about what needs to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| into a policy in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| But I do agree that we don't need to overstep the other policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| but I think it's going to be a complete game changer for our community if they're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| access one policy to be able to find the rest of the information that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| So I support going back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| So any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Madam Chair, I didn't hear if Ms. Owen accepted the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| So can you repeat what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Yes, she did accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| She did or did not? Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Mr. Watson, the motion was to move policy C-260, equity and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| to be reviewed in the March 23rd policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I tend to agree with what Ms. Horne said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2258)|
| 0:37:52| Is that close enough? Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I can hear you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| I'm usually too close to it, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Anyway, I tend to agree with her, and we have all these policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| and I don't think, just to sort of disagree with what you're saying, Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| I don't think that we need something additional with so many, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| parts and legs or whatever you want to call it that somebody can go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| If they see something that is discriminatory in their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| or where some child is not receiving equal treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2317)|
| 0:38:47| including the teacher, an equal teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| and if it involves more money, then we need to take a look at that particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2334)|
| 0:39:03| But at this time, I don't think that we need to adopt a policy like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2343)|
| 0:39:13| I tend to think, now this is just my personal opinion in talking to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| but I tend to think that it's, well, we've just thrown it around here Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| and a little bit tonight and seen how comprehensive it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| How are you going to make that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| or is this like A through Z and you just want to add A, B, and C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| and later on come back and add the rest of the alphabet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| If you want to vote on it tonight, I'll be glad to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Mr. Chin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Just something real quick, because I have heard from a few students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| not just at Farragut but from a variety of schools in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| that they would support such a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Obviously the details and how this policy would interact with other policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| in Knox County, that's not knowledge that I have or really truly understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| but I would hope that perhaps the board might seriously consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| and maybe look at it again in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| whether or not this board agrees to move forward with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Obviously I cannot vote, so I can't influence that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| but just at least for now taking another look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| working through the details and seeing if it is something that could be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| or beneficial to the students of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I think that would be a good direction for the board to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| I'm totally fine with taking it back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| I think I'm with Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I'm not convinced we need a policy because I think we have all these policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| but we can certainly take it back and talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| and see if we can do a listing or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| So, yes, I think my ask will at least take it back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| and whatever policy comes out of that, that is what we vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| and let that be the energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| but I do think that there can be more content provided to what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| that can reach a common goal, and when it comes back to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| then I personally would like to see it go back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| see if we can collectively as a board create a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| because I've been on this board for four years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| and we haven't had a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| So is there something we can create as a collective board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| that serves the whole Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| All I wanted to add, if that's what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| I guess that will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| I just want to remind board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| and I hope people do not take it the wrong way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| I hope people do not take it the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| Students' opinions are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| but the bottom line is this nine-member board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| runs the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| along with whoever the director of schools is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| and I think we need to make sure that we keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| without trying to satisfy students and everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2540)|
| 0:42:30| because when we get into that area, it just opens up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| We've got all kinds of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| and you'll be opening up another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| But that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| I wish board members would keep that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| that this nine-member board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| it ultimately comes down to our decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| and you're not going to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Do we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| So, yes, we have public forum on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| First we have Kristen Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| and then we'll have Rachel Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Kristen Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Okay, great. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| If you could state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| And please speak directly into the mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| so board member Watson can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| Kristen Smith, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| When I was in fourth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| my science teacher took us outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| and told us we'd be learning about rockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| What she didn't tell us is that to learn about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| we'd be watching the gifted and talented students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| shoot their rockets, and we would go chase them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Years before, a group of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| had been chosen for that experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| and the rest of us watched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Now, imagine this experience happens to a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| who just moved to this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Her parents don't speak English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| and she's doing all she can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| to translate what she's learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| She doesn't have the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| to express the hurt she may feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Students in Knox County speak more than 119 languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Imagine if this scene unfolded with a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| who has sensory learning needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| or struggles to regulate emotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| or happens to a child whose caregivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| don't have the resources to intervene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| In Knox County, more than 25% of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| live below the poverty line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Maybe this child lives with a grandparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| doing their best to keep them feeling safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| He infers he doesn't deserve the same experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| as the children around him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Imagine him trying to sit for a standardized test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| one of many these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| but is discouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| feeling like he's always behind everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| As unfair as this story was to me, I was lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| I went home and told my parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| and my mom started a rocket club at the YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| She understood a basic principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| She didn't just buy me a rocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| She recognized that there was a school full of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| in the same spot as me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| and she thought, yeah, I can buy rockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| for all the kids who live around me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| and we can build them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| and we can learn about space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| and that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| My parents didn't have a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| but for my mom, buying a rocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| buying rockets for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| was faith in action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| and I think there's a lesson for us in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| The dictionary defines equity as fairness or justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| in the way that we see that people are treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| When we talk about it, we have to set aside politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| We have to set aside all of the polarization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and we have to recognize that at its core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| equity affirms everyone is starting at a different place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| and meets people where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| to give them what they need to level the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| It recognizes that every human has value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| is worth time, attention, and resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| and equity is worth its own policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| This policy affirms that it is our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| as a school system to do whatever we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| to provide a learning experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| where every child, regardless of race, circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| identity, or status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| has access to the resources that they need to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| It affirms our commitment to keep learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| to keep recognizing inequality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| and to keep striving to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| It takes a village to raise a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| We are their village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| and we have a responsibility to do everything in our power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| to show every child we're valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Are there other policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Of course there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| but this one makes a statement to our entire community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| that says, hey, this matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| You matter to us, every child of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| and that is the reason it's valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Next we'll have Rachel Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Rachel Hudson, state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| My name is Rachel Hudson from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| After listening to Monday night's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| it's evident to me that so many of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| do want equity for your children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| and perhaps there is some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| of what we mean when we use the term equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| The definition of equity is to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| for fairness and impartial treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| and I heard many of you speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| about your personal experiences with your child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| and wanting adequate support for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| and I invite you to take that same emotional pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| that you feel as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| and put yourself in the shoes of the immigrant parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| who is sending their child to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| knowing they can't properly communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| with their classmates and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| and receiving no interpreter and translation support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Put yourself in the shoes of the parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| who knows that their child of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| may not be safe at school that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| and put yourself in the shoes of a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| who is economically disadvantaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| and knows that in order for their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| to have a life free from the stress of poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| they need a chance at a quality education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| Equity looks like meeting dysregulated students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| who had traumatic evenings or mornings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| and meeting them with the emotional regulation support they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| It looks like noticing a child with developmental delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| and advocating for them to receive assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| to qualify for special needs services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| It looks like recognizing a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| who's never received formal schooling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| and doesn't speak English| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| and providing translation support for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| This proposed equity policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| puts the accountability of equitable education in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| It's an acknowledgment that as a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| we realize that not everyone in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| is starting at the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| However, it is our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| to provide every possible opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| for them to have an optimal learning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| And this policy speaks to the frightened parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| who are afraid that their child's going to fall through the cracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| and it calms their fears by saying we see you in your child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| and we're going to do our best to advocate and support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| And it speaks to our teachers and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| who are using advocacy and personal resources every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| and it says as a system we're going to support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| In a time when all of our children's learning has been disrupted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| and we're concerned about learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| I want to remind you that many of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| have lost more than academic support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| And it is going to take a shared commitment and accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| to make sure that the most marginalized students amongst us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| are not kept on the margins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| but cared for by an actual community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| Our community's future social and economic viability and progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| will be highly contingent on this district's capacities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| to open doors of opportunity for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| and not just a historically privileged view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| Equity means we not only advocate for fair treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| for our own children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| but for the needs of our neighbor's children as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you. Next we have Gary Weidman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Gary Weidman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| And after Gary we'll have Denise Bean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| Gary Weidman, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| I am President Emeritus of Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I'm here to speak in support of this proposed equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| I advocate this policy based on my personal and professional experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| with public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| We have four sons who attended public schools in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| and went on to get terminal graduate degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| My wife Janice has a baccalaureate and master's degree from UTK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| and has taught in public schools for more than 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| The Templer School of Education at Johnson has prepared teachers for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| And it is now ably led by Dr. Roy Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| who has a 36-year history in public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| We have about 100 graduates teaching in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| I enthusiastically endorse equity in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| but I realize it's quite a task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| Words like diversity, inclusion, equity have strong political overtones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| used in contexts that many of us and our constituencies find troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| But they're good words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| and we should not concede these good words to troubling political agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| but rather recapture them for our own purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I faced a similar dilemma about words early in my presidency at Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| We wanted to distinguish our school from two predominant kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| of private Christian higher education institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| and we chose to describe ourselves as a third way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| We were not one or the other of the existing ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| We borrowed parts from those, but we were a third way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| One of our board members mentioned that third way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| was the name of a leftist think tank in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| and that might not be a good term for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| We had a robust discussion about third way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| and finally decided not to let the left-leaning association own a very good word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| that was useful in defining who we are for the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| Third way as a term does not necessarily have political implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| We marketed ourselves as a third way school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| and that set the scene for expansion of academic programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| increased enrollment, and more community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| Don't let diversity, inclusion, and equity be barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| to accomplishing what is the right understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| of what they can bring to the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Next we have Denise Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Denise Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Molly Conaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Molly Conaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| State your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| Hi, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Molly Conaway from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| I'm the lead pastor of a faith community called Crossings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| that meets here downtown in the square room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| and also at Christenbury Elementary School on Sunday evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| Our family and our faith community are heavily invested in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| and the schools at Christenbury and at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| I was reflecting this morning about the discussion my husband and I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| several years ago when we were trying to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| when would be the appropriate time to have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| Basically, we decided with wisdom around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| that there is no convenient time to have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| They will always be a disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| We will never have enough time or money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Having children is never convenient, but it is always worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| My understanding is that there's a team of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| who have been working on this equity policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3201)|

| 0:53:43| Maybe another time or another season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| The fact is, equity in education will never be convenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| but it will always be worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote a letter from Birmingham Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| The premise of his letter is the same premise for our conversation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| His goal was to warn the people in power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| that there would never be a convenient time for equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| I'd like to read a couple excerpts from his letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| One of the points in your statement is that our acts are untimely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| Some have asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| why didn't you give the new administration time to act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| The only answer that I can give to this inquiry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| is that the new administration must be prodded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| about as much as the outgoing one before it acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| We will be sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of the new mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| will bring the millennium to Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Frankly, I have never engaged in a direct action movement that was well-timed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| Dr. King said in his letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| For years now, I have heard the word wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| This wait has almost always meant never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| We must come to see with the distinguished jurist of yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| that justice too long delayed is justice denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| And King ended that letter in the same way I'd like to end today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| If I have said anything that is an understatement of the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| and is indicative of an unreasonable impatience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| I beg you to forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| If I have said anything in this that is an overstatement of the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| and is indicative of my having a patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| that makes me patient with anything less than brotherhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| I beg God to forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3318)|

| 0:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| That concludes public forum on that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| So, Ms. Coatney, will you read the motion on the floor once more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3335)|

| 1:00:49| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| I just want to lift up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| I know I had questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| I didn't ask last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| But over the last 48 hours, I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| But this is a committee that has to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| And so if we prepare for additional charter schools to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| this is where that committee comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| So I want to give that clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| But I also want to lift up the maybe consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| I looked at the review committee, and it's mostly central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| which I think it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| But I also think that if you can get input from school level as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| teachers and principals in some capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| then I think that that will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Because you can get so far removed from the day-to-day work that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| might get better insight and input from on the ground, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| So not to change the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| but just do that additional work to get input from people on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| ground doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| So do you want, while we're looking to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| do you want to move that more people are added to the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| No, because I didn't do additional research to have that cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| But I just want a good faith effort that people do their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| to get as much input as possible when making the decisions for charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| So we have a motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Item 11E, discussion and possible action on defense of the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3736)|
| 1:02:27| So we do have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| So first we have Andrea Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3750)|
| 1:02:45| State your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| Andrea Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| I'm Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| Experts don't always know best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| I know my child best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| Experts and experience should be valued, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| not at the expense of the people and their knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| This is a quote from a self-proclaimed social justice advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| who also happens to be one of the plaintiffs in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| This is my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Our children have paid an enormous cost in regards to their education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3808)|
| 1:03:35| their development, and their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Their own knowledge tells them this is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| yet they walk into your schools every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| the schools that the community pays for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| and they mask their beautiful faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| and they diminish their love of learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| all to make just a few feel a little more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| This activist also seems to enjoy at least one of her child's having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| private education at a school where masks are optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| yet our children have to walk into school every day and hide their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| How does this keep her safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Now the law department gets to go into our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| and take their pictures of our kids to show their compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3871)|
| 1:04:40| Why aren't we trying to take pictures of the plaintiffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| when they're out with no mask on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Why do our kids have to carry such a burden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| Now the plaintiffs want to send people into our schools to monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| How are we going to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Maybe let's put them into brown shirts so we know who they are, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| We have done your research for you that you have not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| There is an absolute, or there seems to be an absolute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| I'm sorry, the judge in this case seems to have been brought out of retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| to preside over this one case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Conflict of interest for a family friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| So anyway, I will end this with asking you all to keep your seats tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Do not turn your backs on us tonight, as you did in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Next we'll have Christina Flora.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| State your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3953)|
| 1:06:06| Christine Flora, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| I have four children, three of which attend Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| specifically Hardin Valley Elementary and Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| We have owned our home in Knoxville for exactly one year today, this very day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| We officially moved here last June after school was out from Southern California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| One of our main reasons for moving here was the freedom that Tennessee provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| particularly the freedom associated with our children and their education and their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| When we first moved here, it was like we had found freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| My kids were so excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| However, that freedom seemed to be short-lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| I was a school administrator in California during the whole entire COVID pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| I saw so many instances of children who were struggling due to the rules in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| particularly the rules regarding mask wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| I saw a huge increase in issues with speech and language development and social-emotional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| Talk about equity. That's equity. That's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| We were told that we would be fine for every student that wasn't wearing their mask properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| And I, being a rule follower, made sure that I told the kids to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| I took it to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| Daily, however, it took a toll on me, enough to where I ended my career as a school administrator last June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| because I saw what it was doing to so many children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| We were told to trust the science, to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| And I have to admit, there was a lot of uncertainty in the beginning we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| We know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| In the beginning, I was even making teachers change clothes when they arrived at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| Kids spray their shoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| So all these things were finally debunked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| We let that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| I could go on and on about recommendations that I took seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| but I'd rather focus on talking about my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| My children are the main reason I'm speaking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Our four children spent time in California with the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| My 13-year-old daughter got a mastoid infection twice during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| The pediatrician believed that was due to mask wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| My son has epilepsy, an issue that should be taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| He should not be wearing a mask at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| But my youngest daughter is the one I'm the most concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| She is withdrawn and sad and not okay at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| A problem that was resolved when we first came here and we didn't have the masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| but guess what? It's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| She's now having to see the school counselor at Hardin Valley every week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| because she is not developing, she is not growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| she acts like she can't read half the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| So the science is, trust the science is something we hear all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Yet I believe it's clear now that science doesn't back the wearing of these masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| In fact, recent things that have come out in the news lately show the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Even people from places that are more liberal, more mainstream media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| they all say the cloth masks do not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| Please stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| Next we have Tina Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| No, Deborah Howard. Deborah Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Deborah Howard. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| State your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| I'm Deb Howard, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| I would rather be doing anything than standing here again in front of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| but I'm compelled to speak regarding the lawsuit, masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and the daily harm being inflicted on the 60,000 other students in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| including my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Does Knox County schools not have the right to face their accuser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| So we have these, you know, parents in a lawsuit not known to the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4198)|
| 1:10:09| They know that what they're doing is wrong, these parents do, and not about health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| or they would be proud of their actions, and they would want to be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| The answers to a few questions would also prove this to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| So three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Did the children of these parents attend school prior to the beginning of the pandemic during flu season?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| Did their children attend school during any of the seven to eight wonderful weeks that our kids had without masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| at the beginning of this school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Ms. Howard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Can you talk a little closer to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Oh, can't hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Oh, I thought I was being really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| I can hear you. Mr. Watson can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Did their children attend school during any of the seven to eight weeks at the beginning of this school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| when all the kids were rightly free-faced and free-breathing and happy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| Do these parents take their children anywhere that there is not a mask mandate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| To the grocery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| To shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Almost anywhere in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| There is no mask mandate in place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| So if, you know, there were no masks prior to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| there was very little mask wearing at the beginning of this school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| and there's no mask mandate here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| if the answer to any of these questions is yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| then we know this lawsuit has nothing to do with health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| There is information that shows it is not only not about health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| but most assuredly is about politics and money when you factor in the fact that Democracy Forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| the Hillary Clinton front group, has funded the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| So as it seems, the law director is waiting for you to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| and I know many of you have tried to be on the side of the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| but please push for the magistrate to issue a scheduling order for the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| Something else I would like to just share is I have multiple friends who are much younger than I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| who have kids that are going to be entering school soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| and I am warning them off of going to Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| although my kids have had a lovely time up until the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| because they don't want their kids masked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| and they just don't know what's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| so they're choosing other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| And Tina Shields. Do we have Tina Shields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| All right. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4345)|
| 1:12:37| So we do not have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Well, I guess we do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| Okay. So discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Ms. Sanderson? I don't know who was first there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Or Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| I mentioned to the board the other night that I intended to bring a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| and I will do so tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| I don't think I feel very strongly about these three items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| and so I would like a board action on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| Patty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| And my motion is the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| will not agree to the appointment of a neutral monitor for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| will not submit a compliance plan, as stated by the plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| and will not agree to a three-person compliance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| chosen by the plaintiffs, KCS and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| So that is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| It still stands, and I don't think anything in the last 48 hours has changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| The Knox County Board of Education will not agree to the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| of a neutral monitor for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| will not submit a compliance plan, as stated by the plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| and will not agree to a three-person compliance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| chosen by the plaintiffs, KCS and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| and we will direct our law department to act in accordance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4444)|
| 1:14:11| So we have a motion by Ms. Bounds and a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| Any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| I have a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| I mean, I feel like we're going to bring up a lot of issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Before we vote on Winnie 1, can we kind of go through everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| or do we feel like we need to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Can we have a little bit of discussion about how we handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Mr. Dupler, do I need to withdraw the motion from the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| or how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Yes, because, I mean, right now you can have discussion on that particular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| And then if you want to bring another motion, you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| but right now it's discussion on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| So I will withdraw that motion for now with the intention of bringing it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| after our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| And I'm totally fine about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| I just feel like there's a lot that people want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| I just wanted to make sure we were able to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Get them all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| I've got some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| So who was next over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| I, too, am going to make a motion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| On Monday, me and several other people talked about our desire to just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| frustration that we know everybody is feeling about no end in sight with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| and wanting to try to at least see if we can negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| or mediate with the people, with the plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Since then, we all received an email today from our law directors sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| talking about how complicated that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| And that is one thing I want to explain to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| I don't think the majority, I can't speak for everybody on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| because, once again, this is something we cannot talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| But that is our frustration with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| and the complication of all of this is this is not a typical lawsuit where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| go to your lawyer, you tell your lawyer what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| and they act on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Anything we do has to be done in this platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| So before I put out what I want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| I want Mr. Dupler to kind of explain to everyone what came out to us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| in an email, sort of dealing with the complications over negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| and mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| So a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| As you've highlighted, and as I discussed some on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| this board has to act as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| I mean, there has to be an official vote, and then that's taken forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| either by the law director's office, the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| or whoever is supposed to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| So same with negotiation and mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| Negotiation on a lawsuit can happen a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| It can happen, you know, in person or by phone, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| It's just back and forth, usually between the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| But the attorneys have to have direction from their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| Mediation is a form of negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| Mediation often occurs with a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| A lot of times another attorney doesn't have a dog in the fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| and then you sit down and you'll try and hash it out between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| And all the parties are there, and it's all put into the open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| and sometimes you go back between other rooms and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| Obviously, this board cannot undertake a traditional mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| as you would in some other lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| because this board is subject to the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| and your meetings have to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| So any mediation, quote, unquote, would have to be completely in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| and you would lose all semblance of mediation at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| So what we talked about today was that Ms. Babb and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| and others in our office was, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| is there any other option to mediation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| And there is, but I'll let you talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| because that's what you wanted to talk about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| A lot of my frustration, and I know it's shared by many members of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| is the Sunshine Law, which we all know came out over some illegal maneuvering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| but really hampers us in this type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| And I look forward to talking to our legislators in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| about looking at some legislation that can maybe allow this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| but that does not help us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| So what I'm trying to do, and I'm going to put forward a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| I'm not going to try to put forward a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| because I think we need to have all this discussion first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| but I wanted to put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| I feel like this is the only way that will allow us to do mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| and I'm going to mention two people in this, and they have no idea I'm mentioning them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| and they're both probably going to kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| And there could be substitute people, but this was the way I could put it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| So what I'm going to do is I move that the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| approve our Knox County Law Department to engage in non-binding mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| and that is because people representing us cannot agree to anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| that doesn't come back before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| So into non-binding mediation over the mass mandate litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| within the parameters of state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| with the Board of Education represented by a member of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| and I'm suggesting Chair Christy Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| and a representative of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| with my suggestion being Russ Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| Once again, I know Ms. Christy has no idea I was going to bring this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| but I feel like if we could have one party from Knox County School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| and Mr. Oaks also had no idea that I was going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| but my real idea is to have one representative of our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| along with Knox County Schools Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| that understands some of the complications as we go into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| to try to mediate, and I don't know if we can even get to a mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| or if the other side would even agree to it, but I would like us to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| That's a motion I'm going to bring forward, but not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4814)|
| 1:20:23| Can I go to Mr. Watson first and then come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Okay. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Mr. Dupleur, thank you for that explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| and Ms. Babb for the clarity for that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| I'm supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| I know that's something that's come up here and there in our different sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| and I think that seems to be one of the only strategies to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| Mr. Dupleur, can you also add just a little bit of context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| for the uniqueness of the situation that we have in Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| I know for some there's a big debate still about the efficacy of masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| and all those types of things, and I think we've moved kind of beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| We're in a fairly unique situation in Knox County related to a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| Can you speak to that related to just, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| what the judge has ruled versus what the legislature has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| versus our authority as a school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Because I don't know that the public fully appreciates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| how unique this situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| Yes. Mr. Watson, I think I understand what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| What you're asking is we're under this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| the school system is under a court-ordered mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| which is fairly unique from what we can find in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| There's been similar cases across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| We have cited those similar cases in our briefing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| particularly with the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| But this judge put this mandate on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| and obviously this board was unwilling to have that mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| because it voted against the mandate prior to the fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| So we have that, which is direct court order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| and although we have certainly been fighting against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| and don't agree with it, we do have to respect that it is a court order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| So the board has to deal with that, and then on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| we've got the state of Tennessee that passes a recent statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| 14-2-104 to be specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| that says you're not supposed to have a mask mandate, school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| except under very, very limited circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| and even then only for temporary times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| So when we come to talk about mediation and negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| you know, the school board then has to be mindful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| of not violating state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| in coming to any type of proposed settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| So does that cover what you wanted to cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Yes, thank you. That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| Was that all, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| Mr. Watson, did you have anything else right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| No, I'm good for now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Okay. Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| So I have a PowerPoint presentation, which I will do later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| but I want to bring to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| It's something that we don't vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| because it's actually under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| and county commission has the power to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| But I'll be honest. I've been very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| This is not a reflection on Mr. Dupler in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| but I have been very disappointed in how our law director has handled this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| They have filed failing cases at the trial level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| at the appeals court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| and I have actually drafted a letter to Mr. Butte| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| requesting he seek outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| If he won't act, I'm then asking county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| to utilize their power under the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| to grant the board the power to seek outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| I'm going to sign this letter, and I will send it around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| and invite any other board member to sign it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| So are you going to do a PowerPoint now, or are you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| I could do my PowerPoint now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| Unless...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| If we could get...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Now, I do know that we were having some issues with the PowerPoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| because we do have Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Oh, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Okay, I do have handouts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| So that's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| So I provided handouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| and Ms. Coatney and Ms. Kelly provided handouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| in case I couldn't get the PowerPoint to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| So I've actually asked the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| to send this to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| In a response from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| I was told that they were unaware of the scientific changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| that have been happening in the past couple weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| which I found these articles on Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| So I'm going to go to the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| and these are experts in the medical field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| and these are experts who, for the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| have been advocating for masks in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| and in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| The first one is an associate professor from Harvard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| One-way masking is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Let's dispense with the notion that masks are only protective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| if everyone is wearing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| N95 masks, now widely available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| offer better protection than universal surgical mask use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| which is the approach used in hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Masks for our kids in schools should be optional in the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| and this is from December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| We cannot continue to subject kids to the 2020 playbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| as adults go out and do whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| And remember, parents who don't feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| can always have their children wear high-grade masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| This is from a progressive columnist from The New York Times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| and she's cared about masking this entire time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| and is highly regarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| and a regular columnist in The New York Times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| That's why I believe that mandatory school masking should end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| when the coronavirus rates return to pre-Omicron levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| Otherwise, I fear, at least in very liberal areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| a combination of extreme risk aversion and inertia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| means that school masking will persist indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| And this is happening here in Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| There is no end date for these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| There is no end date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Next slide, The Washington Post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| Four infectious disease physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| one from Tufts Medical Center, one from Harvard Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| one from Boston Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| We are strongly supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| We were strongly supportive of universal masking policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| in the fall of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| But universal masking policies in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| have not come without cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| In certain parts of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| where CDC mask guidelines were rigorously adhered to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| children have not seen the faces of their teachers or classmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| since early 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| This affects learning and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| particularly for our youngest learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Maintaining aggressive mitigation policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| including stringent mask rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| also sends children, families, and staff the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| that our schools are not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| And this is simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| We urge public health and school officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| to educate communities on one-way masking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| emphasizing personal choice regarding self-protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| and supporting those who choose to remain masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| Our children have sacrificed a lot to protect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| Now it's time for us to give them their childhood back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| From The Atlantic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| And again, these are all experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| who have been supporting masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| From The Atlantic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Imposing on millions of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| an intervention that provides little discernible benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| on the grounds that we have not yet gathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| solid evidence of its negative effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| violates the most basic tenet of medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| First, do no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| The foundation of medical and public health intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| should be that they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| not that we have insufficient evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| to say whether they are harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| Continued mandatory masking of children in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| especially now that most school-age children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| are eligible for vaccine, fails this test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| And then the last...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| I had a video, but that's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| So my last slide here is a list of all the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| 38 states currently have no mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| 12 do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Five more governors announced this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| that they are ending their mask mandates in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Connecticut ending it on February 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| Delaware ending their school mask mandate by March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| Massachusetts...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| Massachusetts, y'all!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| It's February 28th!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| New Jersey, March 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| and Oregon ending their school mask mandate by March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| Our kids are being held hostage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| as governors in blue states are lifting their mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| It is now abundantly clear one-way masking works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| It always has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| It was a lie from the public health officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| because they were worried about a run on N95 masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| and that's why I request anyone who wants to sign this letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| to seek outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| At this point...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you, Ms. Henderson, for highlighting all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| What we've known for a year and a half now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| that people are finally catching up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| so we have some scientific evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| that proves what we as moms and just common-sense people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| already knew, but anyway, that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| You know, I just have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| on behalf of the parents that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| that I'm appalled at this entire situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5424)|
| 1:30:31| Our kids are suffering academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| They're suffering in their reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| Many of these kids are going to have lifelong damage from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| and I watched a video today of a dad who was crying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| because of what had happened to his child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| I think she was in Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| Kids are suffering emotionally and developmentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| So based on the things that you've highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| based on other studies that I've sent to the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| what I would like to propose is that we direct them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| to file a change of circumstance citing all of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| the many, many, many things that have come out now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| in the media with many doctors who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| who have stated various things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| And so since this lawsuit was filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| the things that have, the things that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| the big things that have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Vaccines are available to anyone in our school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Even though we know children are at extremely low risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| from this illness, vaccines are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| Variants are getting less and less deadly as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| This latest one is highly transmissible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| but it's less virulent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| And as the next variant comes around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| it will be even more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| Mask mandates in schools are being lifted all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| as Ms. Henderson has already outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| And also she's already outlined the fact that one-way masking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| protects the wearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| And there's also a study out of the U.K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| that states that the risk of severe illness in children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| with health issues is no greater than healthy children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| So based on these things, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| I've sent a plethora, one document that had LinkedIn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| probably a hundred different studies and articles with masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| So the law department already has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Based on these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| what I would like to discuss with the board is directing the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| department to file a change of circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| Ms. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| I wanted to ask the law director for some clarification on Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5576)|
| 1:33:04| Bowne's potential motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| If we were to adopt Ms. Bowne's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| that is only to the plaintiffs, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| We wouldn't be saying that to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| And we couldn't, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| Yes, Ms. Sullivan, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| I mean, the way I understand her motion would be to reject any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| type of an agreement with the plaintiffs based upon what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| filed Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| I also have a couple of questions for Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| Looking at the second page of your handout, Michelle Goldberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| I missed her professional qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| What were those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| She is an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| She writes opinion columns for the New York Times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| So no professional qualifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| So then even assuming that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| what pre-Omicron levels is she referencing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| I'd have to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| I can find that out for you and send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Do you have a pre-Omicron level that you would find acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| I'd have to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| I'm happy to ask, though, some experts and find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| The only thing I would point out at this time is that in states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| where mask regulations are changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| generally it's because their situations are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| Those states also have significantly lower deaths per million people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5675)|
| 1:34:49| than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| At this time, we have lost one of every 296 people in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5692)|
| 1:35:01| One of every 296.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| That's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| Most other states are not close to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| When I was checking my math Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| our staff said, I thought it was 300-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| Yes, it was a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| And now it's one per 296.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| And those are actually last week's numbers because the state hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| added this week's numbers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| So we really need to take a second and think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| instead of just these really huge numbers and thinking about how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| thousands per how many millions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| think about one person of every 296 people in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5755)|
| 1:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| Yes, I mean, I appreciate all the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| And I share the frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| And my thing that I brought out was just trying to figure out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| So this is a question for Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| And maybe it's actually for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| I just don't understand the change of circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| and an explanation of, like, who would that go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| That's really all I'm trying to understand is really how that would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| and how that might affect what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Yeah, so that's what we've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| We've asked that question in executive session several times about if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| there's a change of circumstance, they can file a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| So I would definitely like for Mr. Dupler to explain that because I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| certainly he will have a much better explanation than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Thank you, Madam, I mean, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| So, yes, you know, when this lawsuit was filed, it was the Delta wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| And there were not vaccines available for the younger children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| So based upon those two things alone, you know, our office can file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| for a change of circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Now, it's back before a judge who gave us this order to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| So, I mean, you know, we all have to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| But certainly that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| In addition to the work that's being done with the Sixth Circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| which is obviously an entirely different court than the court that gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| this school system this mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| But, yeah, is that something else that can be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| So I guess another question I have is could some of this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| be done simultaneously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| We're kind of all putting stuff out there, but I don't know if, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| if we all decided Susan's recommendation is the best one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| then we shouldn't do mediation or we could do all of the above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| and misbounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| That's where I guess I'm looking for some legal expertise on do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| to look at one thing forward or are there multiple avenues that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| pursue because, to me, I'd like to do the multiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| I want to go, I mean, I really, I think that's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| I think that's the frustration everybody's hearing is just we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| see everything possible being done to see that this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| and maybe, you know, to Ms. Owen's point, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| Omicron's out there right now, the numbers are super high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| but if Knox County follows what the rest of the world is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| we should sharply fall very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| So not necessarily that it's today, but is there an end in sight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| And that is what I think everybody is looking for is an end in sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| So, and I will just say I have a motion that I'm going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| and it actually mentions a change of circumstances thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| Oh, okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Well, I was just going to say quickly, I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| when we've talked about this in executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| we've been looking for the perfect opportune time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and it's still not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Meanwhile, you know, I think that kids still have a much higher risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| when they get in the car to go to school every day than they do of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| So that is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| So like you said, maybe it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| maybe it's in two weeks when the numbers look a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| But a lot has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| I mean, even a lot has changed even still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Even though our numbers are high, a lot has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| So I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| And I'm not asking for us to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| I just think, you know, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Yeah, I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| I think it's a good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| and I think this is wise that we're going through everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| and then we can kind of sort back through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| So to that question, I mean, can we do multiple things at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| I mean, what's your opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| And I know it's just your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Well, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| You know, so now we're getting into, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| strategy for active litigation, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| And any good attorney, you know, would tell his or her client that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| can multiple things be going on at once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Can you expect great success with a shotgun approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| You know, but I don't want to get too far into, you know, strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| because, again, all this is public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| We're broadcasting it to the plaintiffs and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| But in answer to your question, simply put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| can multiple things be going on at once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Obviously, we disagree with Ms. Henderson's tact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| You know, frustration is high, and, you know, people want to point fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| We get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| We are your attorneys, you know, unless the county charter is changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| I guess I'll direct this toward you, Ms. Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| because you seem to be the one that wants to mediate and do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| I think in listening to board members speak, I think all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| I mean, this is obviously not the first time we've talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| and we did vote to unmask, and I've been for that from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6100)|
| 1:41:49| Having said that, as the law director said, there are or there is a legal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6109)|
| 1:41:59| Now, without us litigating it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| I think the law department of Knox County has a very good idea of what we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6125)|
| 1:42:15| and they want to, I believe, this is my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| I believe they would want to rectify it as quickly as they possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6140)|
| 1:42:29| Given that, I think the best thing we could do is to take a vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6149)|
| 1:42:41| to support the Knox County Law Department and let them proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| They're familiar with all the ins and outs, things we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| things we probably shouldn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| But I would be glad to make a motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| We can still have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Yeah, we'll continue with discussion and then do all the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| So I will say that while I've never supported mask and would like for this to end tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| I think to mediate with the plaintiffs at this time is ill-advised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| especially in light of their most recent communication, I guess today or yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| and the additional demands that they made in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6212)|
| 1:43:38| So I would support providing the Sixth Circuit Appeals Court the opportunity to rule on the injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6218)|
| 1:43:46| We don't have a timetable, but we know that the Sixth Circuit is getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| is closer to acting on it than ever before and could come at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| And so ruling on that injunction and according to what I've read, we have a good chance of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6237)|
| 1:44:05| And regardless, we will have more information for negotiation after the court rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| So when we are this close to the Sixth Circuit ruling on it and we've suffered through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6252)|
| 1:44:21| and I don't want to suffer anymore, but I think it is ill-advised to jump into mediation at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6261)|
| 1:44:29| with the plaintiffs who do not seem willing and have made some very heavy demands on this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6269)|
| 1:44:37| including the ones that were most recently sent out after our law department reached out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| So I do not support mediation at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| I'd like to let the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Then we can negotiate from a position maybe of strength instead of weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| And I'm just going to jump in here and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| Everyone should have, I mentioned bringing a motion on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| partly for a cause near and dear to me with children receiving speech services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6305)|
| 1:45:15| which we have 3,358 in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| I believe Mr. Meyer said two to three of those currently have mask exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6320)|
| 1:45:29| And I do feel like maybe Judge Greer's forgotten that he's holding us all hostage over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6329)|
| 1:45:36| because it seems like everybody else is just going on living their best lives and he probably is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| So, you know, I would like to see us be at least give relief to this group of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6344)|
| 1:45:53| And since I mentioned this on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| I started receiving a bunch of other emails that will just really break your heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| of other people who have asked for mask exemptions and have been denied for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| And, you know, my current concern is that in trying to do everything exactly the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| I guess we've been directed to do it, maybe, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| that we are currently discriminating against a whole other group of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6382)|
| 1:46:31| So, my motion that everybody should have a copy of and I'm going to read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6391)|
| 1:46:38| and then I will let Mr. Dupler speak to it because he's not in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| I'm just going to warn everyone, he's not in complete agreement, but we still like each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| And we did have a little bit of a discussion today about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| So I will just let him weigh in on his thoughts on it afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| But my motion would be that any student who receives speech services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| as well as any student or staff member who provided a note from a health care provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6420)|
| 1:47:07| that was previously denied a mask exemption by Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| be granted an exemption beginning Friday, February 11, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| The principal or principal designee at each school will be responsible for keeping a list of exemptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| and submitting it weekly to the director of student services or his designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| The Knox County Board of Education requests that the Knox County Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| file an emergency change of circumstance motion with Judge Greer by the end of the business day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| on Friday, February 11, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| So I would let Gary speak to that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| And, yes, I have great respect for you, and we understand what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| And, of course, if this board directs us to file a change of circumstance motion, we will certainly do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6474)|
| 1:48:02| But it is my duty to unfortunately inform you that if this board votes in favor of what I would call a blanket exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6482)|
| 1:48:14| in other words, not one that's individualized pursuant to the IDEA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| and the court's reinvigoration of policy C-240, that the court would likely hold this board in contempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6499)|
| 1:48:36| Which I, you know, like I said, I strongly feel like we're discriminating against this group of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| and I don't know how the rest of the board feels, but I feel like I could, you know, in good faith if that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6523)|
| 1:48:51| tell the judge that, you know, he's not getting the emails I'm getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| He's not hearing from the parents I'm hearing from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| You know, and they have very real concerns, and I do feel like we are discriminating against a large group of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6537)|
| 1:49:05| So this is something I feel strongly about, and I will support it because, you know, that's a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6545)|
| 1:49:12| That's a risk I personally am willing to take, but I completely understand if the board is not supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6552)|
| 1:49:24| Ms. Fong, I don't know who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| Well, I think you're, well, first of all, I didn't read your whole motion before I made mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| I didn't realize you had in there a change of circumstance because I only read the first couple lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| I think you, I mean, because a note I had made was around accommodations to all students who qualify for a mask exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6575)|
| 1:49:44| but have not, under the ADA, but haven't been granted one, but I think you cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| I think that's covered in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| I think there were other people's lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| I'll let them speak and then come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| I'd like to address Ms. Bounds and her comments, and I think we're actually more in agreement than disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| And I think where I'm coming from is a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| My concern, if we knew a date for the court of appeals and when they were going to get back to us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| there is the hope that this is an emergency appeal and that there is the hope that it will be looked at maybe sometime in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6624)|
| 1:50:33| but they could take months on even ruling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| The hope is that there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| That's my concern, is if we knew March 2nd the courts were meeting and we were going to get an answer one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6639)|
| 1:50:47| I totally probably agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| My concern is we don't have that kind of guarantee, and this could drag out a lot longer even with the court of appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| So that's a little bit of my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| The second thing I want to address is the demands that we got from them, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| I don't want to agree to those either, but I think that's where talking to several different attorneys, that's kind of how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| It's like they make demands and then we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| It is a negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| I don't personally, you know, we can't vote on everything, but me personally, I don't support those demands we saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| but I think that was a starting point, and from talking to several attorneys, that's how it usually works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| It's an extreme, an extreme, and you kind of keep working, and I think there are people on this board that don't think we should give it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| and I respect that, and I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| I just, I'm so frustrated of not seeing an end to it that I'm trying to figure out some way to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| and what's been very interesting to me is I think we've all seen their extremes in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| You know, we've had the extreme anti-masker group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| We've had other people that haven't wanted to leave their house and barely would do a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| and I'll tell you, I've heard from both sets of those people this week calling me going, oh my gosh, it is time to end this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6718)|
| 1:52:06| Please, like, you know, they were excited to hear we were talking about mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| so it was kind of interesting to hear some of these people that are at extremes are finally going, you know, if we can just get somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6729)|
| 1:52:17| so I just kind of wanted to say I understand where you're coming from, but I wanted to explain kind of where I'm coming from, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| And can I respond to Ms. Vetch before you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| And I respect your, I mean, you make a very convincing argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| My support would be more willing to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| I mean, we're at the middle of February to wait until after spring break and see if something has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| I mean, we're a month out, four weeks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Now, I know for those children, because my granddaughter is one that has left Knox County Schools to go to a neighboring county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6763)|
| 1:52:51| because of the mask mandate and the anxiety that it was causing her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| I don't, for the children, I don't want to wait four weeks, but I just think it's better to let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| So time-wise, I could support it if we waited maybe until after spring break and gave the court a chance to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6781)|
| 1:53:10| because I think it's always better to negotiate from a place of strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| And I think with everything that Ms. Henderson said and, you know, Ms. Horn said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| if this Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals doesn't see what is obvious to the entire world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| and 38 states don't have a mask mandate and five of the bluest states have just lifted theirs, then shame on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6807)|
| 1:53:36| You know, like I just, I think it's always better to be negotiating from a position of strength, militarily and medically too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6816)|
| 1:53:44| Can I respond to Patty and Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| And I don't have a problem with that if maybe, and I could maybe hold off on mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| if we could sort of say if we don't get the resolution we want out of the appeals court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| we're willing to call a special session to re-talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| because that's my concern is with the way our meetings go and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| I mean, I just don't want this dragging out so much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| You know, and I think we're all in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| I mean, not all of us, but I think you and I are kind of probably on the same thing of we want some resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| I like that idea, Ms. Bounds, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| I have some questions for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| Could you help our board understand if we are found in contempt, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6870)|
| 1:54:39| Nothing really would change with the mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| but would that be individually in contempt or in contempt as a body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| So, I mean, I can only speak in general terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| I don't know what the judge would do exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| but federal judges have what's called civil contempt powers and criminal contempt powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6897)|
| 1:55:05| With this being a board, as we've talked about, and you all act as a board after you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| again, what I can tell you is that the most likely outcome, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| for some type of contempt initially would likely be some type of financial penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| such as thousands of dollars a day or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| If the contempt were to continue, and like you said, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| the judge would not change his ruling with contempt pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| It could get into criminal penalties for certainly certain board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| But, I mean, again, that's just kind of projecting down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| I mean, the most likely scenario initially would be some type of financial penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| Thank you, Mr. Diepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| I also have a question about some potential different language in Ms. Christie's proposed motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6956)|
| 1:56:06| Would it be the same if we directed the staff to review and reconsider those who were previously denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6966)|
| 1:56:15| if the parent submits a current note from a health care provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| So if the parent would like for us to review that and potentially reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| then the parent could request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| Would that be more individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| Would that take care of that blanket exemption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| I mean, if this board were to tell the administration to go back and look at these cases individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=6997)|
| 1:56:44| then in our office opinion that would meet the requirements under the court's order and the C-240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7004)|
| 1:56:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| I appreciate the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| I think I've been able to follow most of it, and I completely understand what Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7024)|
| 1:57:11| you're trying to accomplish and Ms. Bounds are trying to accomplish and Ms. Babb is trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| I've not heard much of what Ms. Owen has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| but I think in my opinion the most opportune thing to do at this time is to try to negotiate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7039)|
| 1:57:26| and I think all the other points that we're talking about could be opportunities for negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| And I think if we, at this point, if we do something like put ourselves in contempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| I think it makes it much more difficult moving forward in trying to work with plaintiffs and or the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7058)|
| 1:57:46| And so I'd like to get somebody to the table to have some conversations and see how we can move this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| because I don't think anybody, nobody wants it to stay where it is, and it feels stuck with no resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7072)|
| 1:58:00| And for all the reasons we've mentioned already, we're pretty limited in how we can negotiate that as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| but I think Ms. Babb's suggestion of having two parties negotiate on our behalf is a good faith effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7086)|
| 1:58:14| And certainly without being certain of the timing of anything, I think the time is now for the negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7094)|
| 1:58:22| I mean, we can continue to choose to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| My guess is that's going to continue to amp up frustration among us as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7104)|
| 1:58:32| but then also as the public and others, just to not have any answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| So I don't know that, I guess in my mind, I don't know that a negotiation at this point can hurt anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| And I think it would be worth our while to at least try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7123)|
| 1:58:51| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| I just wanted to weigh in on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| I think Ms. Bounds makes good points about the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7137)|
| 1:59:05| that surely they are seeing what we are seeing every, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| if you watch the news for an hour, you'll see at least, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| half a dozen or more reports on what's happening across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| So I would think that that would be seen by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| I'm hesitant to go to mediation because I think when you have a listing of demands that we recently saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7160)|
| 1:59:27| I'm not sure that we're going to get to a place that we could ever agree, that I would ever be comfortable on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| So I'm hesitant right now to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| You know, we can always revisit it later, and I'm happy to come to any called meeting at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| But I would be, I would not want to go for that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7182)|
| 1:59:48| Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| I think Ms. Babb brought up some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| I mean, I'm frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| There is no end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| I know we're all frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| I do agree, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| I don't care for mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| I think I would be up to negotiations because it's a little less formal and it's a faster process just to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| because we could see where they're coming from because we can always say no and we're not accepting those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| My concern is if we lose this appeal in the spring, there is, our kids are in masks for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7215)|
| 2:00:24| We're going to be the only county in the entire country where our kids are wearing masks if we lose this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| That's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| And, you know, trial dates are being set for 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| I talked to other outside counsel outside of Knox County, and they even think it would be dragged out past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7235)|
| 2:00:44| So we're looking at possibly no end in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| So I do think I would like to see some kind of negotiation just to see where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| We can always say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| I think their list of demands that they sent us yesterday was absurd and absolutely ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| But I do think because it's a faster process, I do agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7258)|
| 2:01:06| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| I agree with a lot of what's been said, most of what's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| We're all frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| But I do think, and first of all, let me say, we can always have a call meeting and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7278)|
| 2:01:29| There's nothing to prevent that as long as, you know, as long as we have a forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| I guess you could meet and talk, even if you didn't have five people show up, couldn't you, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7295)|
| 2:01:45| If there was a call meeting and only four people showed up, it wouldn't be a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| It would be a discussion, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| You couldn't have a vote at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| I was just saying, you know, pointing out that it's not really that difficult to get us together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7319)|
| 2:02:08| if we think that we've reached some point of impasse or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7328)|
| 2:02:19| I'm going to make a motion to allow the law department to continue, now that they know what our thoughts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7339)|
| 2:02:38| and to do everything that they feel is possible as quickly as they can that does not violate the rules or jeopardize the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7358)|
| 2:02:57| Do I need anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| Mr. Law Director, does that basically give you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| Do you want to finish the discussion before we start making motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| I want to make a motion, if anybody will second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| I don't think we're going to go anywhere with the discussion, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| So we have a motion by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| Wait a minute, I didn't get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| Jennifer did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| So we have a motion by Mr. McMillan and a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| Do you want to read the motion, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| Mr. McMillan, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but the motion is to allow the law department to continue now that they've heard the board's thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7416)|
| 2:03:44| to do everything they feel possible as quickly as they can that doesn't break rules or jeopardize the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7424)|
| 2:03:51| I have a question regarding the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| Mr. Dupler, if we were to do this, would this preclude us from also passing or prevent us from also passing Ms. Babb's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7436)|
| 2:04:06| I guess what I'm asking is, could both be in play at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7446)|
| 2:04:16| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| The motions that I've heard, yes, there can be multiple motions made that would not conflict with that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7460)|
| 2:04:31| The way I understand Mr. McMillan's motion is it's really a vote of confidence for the law department to continue on its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7471)|
| 2:04:38| I'm asking if we do that, does that then prevent us from entering into a third-party negotiation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7478)|
| 2:04:46| No. Again, we can continue with the litigation as quickly as possible, but also enter into negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7486)|
| 2:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Pardon me, but I want to ask the law director something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| In reference to what Mr. Watson was asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| it would take a vote of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| I mean, you all as lawyers within the law department can do whatever you deem reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7517)|
| 2:05:28| now that you know the feelings and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| But you can't, without a vote by a majority of this board, engage in discussion, negotiations, that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7532)|
| 2:05:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| So, yes, negotiation for this board is going to be a separate part of the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7559)|
| 2:06:08| because this board will have to vote either similar to what Ms. Babb suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7568)|
| 2:06:16| which is designating someone to negotiate, but there again, that's non-binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7576)|
| 2:06:24| or this board would have to discuss and come up with something in the way of a proposal or settlement type of demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7584)|
| 2:06:37| So either way, this board would have to weigh in on any type of settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| That's what I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| They can't just individually interject themselves into the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7605)|
| 2:06:52| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| Okay, so we have a motion by Mr. McMillan and a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| Do you mind reading it one more time, and then we'll do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| I mean, right now, our law department is charged with doing exactly what Mr. McMillan is saying, I think, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7627)|
| 2:07:16| I guess I'm a little confused we're going to vote for them to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| I mean, I guess I want clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| I mean, it sounds like they're already supposed to do what you're telling them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| So what are we voting on that's different than what they're doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| After they have heard all these comments and everything, it goes back to what Ms. Bounds was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7653)|
| 2:07:47| I think that they will do anything within their legal power that they can do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7667)|
| 2:07:56| They may not be able to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| They may have to wait until they hear something from the judge, I mean from the Sixth Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7678)|
| 2:08:09| But at least you were the one, I believe, Ms. Babb, that wanted the people of Knox County to know where we stood and what we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7689)|
| 2:08:22| This is one way of encouraging that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| I'm not for negotiating with the plaintiffs or doing any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7706)|
| 2:08:34| I just think this is one time you need to let the courts work its way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7714)|
| 2:08:43| One thing I'm convinced about, and I'll say no more about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| but they're not the people that filed this suit are not really concerned about that much about the health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7729)|
| 2:09:01| The person they got to file the suit has another motive in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| I don't think they really care about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| You know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| What I hear, Mr. McMillan, and I heard your question too and understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| but I think what I hear Mr. McMillan saying is this is the first time publicly that this board has weighed in very strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7761)|
| 2:09:30| because we've tried to be patient, but has weighed in this strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| and given the motions that we've talked about bringing forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| given the discussion that our law department would take all of that into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| and react to what has happened in the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| That's what I hear him saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| Yes, their job still remains the same, but now they have, well, a large majority of the board say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7795)|
| 2:10:04| here's what we want, you know, just like my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| No, we're not going to let these outsiders come into our schools and file our kids as teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| So I think it's just that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| I think we're going to have to vote on all the suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| I mean, our law department otherwise is going to do exactly what they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| which I think maybe Mr. McMillan's happy with, but I feel like there's a lot of us really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| There's a lot of us here because, and this got put on the agenda because a lot of us are frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| So to me, I'm not happy with just the same old, same old, which I think is what I feel like you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| No, I'm not happy with it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| But I have been around long enough and know a little bit about the process to know what you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7843)|
| 2:10:51| and what you cannot do and what you can do to damage your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| I'm not any lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| I don't profess any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| I don't want to mislead anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| But I've seen enough and know enough about the law that sometimes, even as difficult as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7866)|
| 2:11:17| you just have to ride the wave out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| And I'm, you know, I'm just, I just want, I guess Mr. Washington said a support of confidence or a vote of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7881)|
| 2:11:33| I want them to know, and I know some of you are upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| I know there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| But maybe after this discussion, this meeting tonight, and if the vote turns out to be positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7899)|
| 2:11:49| maybe the public will understand a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7909)|
| 2:11:56| And they'll not, it's not like they're, you know, like the law department's gone on a vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7916)|
| 2:12:03| I assure you it's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| So that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| First, let me say that I think that it's important to note that I think Mr. Dupler gets to sit here with us representing the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7932)|
| 2:12:24| And he's not always the one who is making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| And I think that's important to note because I know as board members we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| a lot of times things happen in the district and everybody's blaming the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| We didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| So, you know, I understand how he feels, so I just wanted to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| But I think what we may want to discuss and kind of relative to what Mr. Millen has talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| is perhaps we ask the law director to put a fresh face on this case from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7965)|
| 2:12:53| There are other attorneys in the law department that could work alongside Amanda Morris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| and continue to kind of take over a lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| I know a lot of people have a lot of respect for Houston Havocy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| Perhaps if we ask the law director to ask him to step in and assist in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7987)|
| 2:13:14| and have some fresh perspective on the case, that that could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| And so, you know, that's still depending on the work that the law department's already doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| but it's putting another something different in front of the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| So would this be offered up as a friendly amendment in addition to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| Because we have his motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| I have no problem with you adding in to ask for somebody additionally within the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8022)|
| 2:13:51| as long as they're within the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| Yeah, it would be an ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Keep in mind, the law director is really under no obligation to do that if he chooses not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8035)|
| 2:14:04| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| It would simply be an ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| And I requested that yesterday, actually, in an email to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| So this is a friendly amendment to his, in addition to his motion, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8052)|
| 2:14:21| So I think that whoever seconded that, his motion would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| That would be Ms. Sowood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| What if we just stopped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8069)|
| 2:14:30| I think I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| As parents, what if we just stopped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8071)|
| 2:14:32| I think I would be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| No, you can't interrupt while we're conducting a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| But you cannot interrupt a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| I'm sorry, but you can't interrupt a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| That is a third option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| I think I would agree that it would be, that would be acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| as long as it is a clear request that the law director consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| and not that we are trying to direct the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| It would be an ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| It would definitely be a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| So, Ms. Henderson, did you have something on that specific motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| Well, I have a question for Mr. Diepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| And tell me if I should ask this question later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| So can the Court of Appeals consider new evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| or is it based on the pleadings and moment of injunction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| In the current appeal, the Court of Appeals can only consider what's already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8126)|
| 2:15:33| you know, been in evidence and the documents submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| They can consider the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| And certainly we have submitted not only controlling law on the Sixth Circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| but also litigation that has happened more recently in other jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8146)|
| 2:15:52| due to masking and, you know, vaccines and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| But the answer to your question is they can only consider what has now been submitted to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| So basically the Court of Appeals will hear the same case that's already lost twice, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8164)|
| 2:16:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| The Court of Appeals will now consider fully what the trial court should have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8173)|
| 2:16:24| in a very, very preliminary hearing that was at the very start of a litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8184)|
| 2:16:32| and that there was a preliminary motion that was heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| and I think that's what you're also referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| but a preliminary motion are usually dismissed as a matter of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| This will be the first real chance for a separate court to actually hear these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8203)|
| 2:16:57| Ms. Babb, did you have something on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| Can I—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| I think it may be—I think I want to withdraw my friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| I think it may be clearer to vote on these two things separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| Ms. Owen, did you have something about Mr. McMillan's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8235)|
| 2:17:21| Sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| I think there's some confusion about exactly where we are in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8244)|
| 2:17:30| and maybe we need to have Mr. Dupler again remind us of where we are in the litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8250)|
| 2:17:39| and that there hasn't really been a trial trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| Yes, thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| So what happened was in a normal litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| the case is filed and over a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| and normally litigation takes time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| it's a very lengthy and often frustrating process that can take a year, two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| possibly even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| but what happened in this particular case was the plaintiffs immediately after filing the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8289)|
| 2:18:17| went to the judge and asked that masks be put on the Knox County schools immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8297)|
| 2:18:25| and basically took whatever small proof they had with them at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| and the judge went ahead and granted what's called an injunction, preliminary injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8311)|
| 2:18:39| So as is proper, our office asked that that injunction be reconsidered by the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8319)|
| 2:18:47| and the judge, who had already issued a 50-plus page opinion, said no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8327)|
| 2:18:54| and then that's what gave us the opportunity to appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| to have a panel of judges actually look at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| So once the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rules, it then comes back down to the trial court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8346)|
| 2:19:13| and there's been discussion here today about outside attorneys talking about trial dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| and our office has already said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| I mean the trial date at the earliest in this case would likely be late this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| but probably sometime next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| So as far as the merits of the case, we could be fighting this for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| but the immediate concern is trying to get the injunction removed and masks off kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8375)|
| 2:19:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| Okay, so Ms. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| Yes, I actually have a question. I think it goes along with Mr. McMillan's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| Mr. Dupler, is there a way, because I think part of the frustration is too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8391)|
| 2:19:57| the public has no idea what's going on with this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| Frankly, we don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| I feel very out in the dark about what is going on, how long is this going to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8402)|
| 2:20:08| Can David Buick, the law director, come to our meetings and give an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| I don't know, once a month, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| He's elected and he needs to be held accountable too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| And he is not getting in touch with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| No one knows what's going on with their own children with this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| I think he needs to come here and speak fairly often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| and let everyone know what's going on with this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8431)|
| 2:20:37| Would you like to take that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| I guess. I don't consider that a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| But that would be up to the law director, David Buick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8443)|
| 2:20:49| and I can certainly ask him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| I would say that any time any of you board members want to talk about the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| we're always open to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| And we also have partnered with the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| and specifically with the superintendent to put out updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| And there's now a page on the KnoxSchools.org website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| talking about updates as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| Thank you. I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| How many medical professionals did the law director bring in the September case as witnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8479)|
| 2:21:37| But the other side did have experts, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| At the preliminary hearing in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| it was literally a trial by ambush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| and we were not given the opportunity to present medical evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| So at no other time there was opportunity to present that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| There's not been the opportunity since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| because we, again, appealed it to the Sixth Circuit as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| I'm not trying to attack you, Mr. Diepler. You're just the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| No, I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| So you said that would be up to if Mr. Buick wanted to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| So as his client, we can't request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| It's just up to him if he just feels like coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| No, that's not what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| I said I would certainly take that to him, and that's certainly his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| But then it's up to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8549)|
| 2:22:30| We can't tell him as a client we want an update on where we are on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| And the public needs an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| Well, again, I mean, you all can talk to him at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8556)|
| 2:22:42| And any of us in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| And we are updating with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| But if you feel that more updates are needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| then we can certainly look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| I just feel that Mr. Buick cares more about his reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| than the 60,000 kids in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| Ms. Bounds, do you have something on Mr. McMillan's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| To kind of piggyback off of what Mr. Dupler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| So am I correct in that when you said kind of trial by ambush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| or whatever it was, preliminary injunction by ambush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| the other side only presented one medical professional at that injunction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| whatever that was that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Was there more than questionable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| That would be my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| Well, other attorneys in my office attended or our office attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8617)|
| 2:23:43| But, I mean, that is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| So we were not allowed to provide medical evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| until we get to the Sixth Circuit Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| They brought theirs, and they were allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| Well, again, the trial on the merits hasn't occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| That's normally where you would present medical evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| you know, through depositions or other in-person testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| This was just a preliminary hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| and that's why we ended up having to appeal it to the Sixth Circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| because of the nature of a preliminary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| And I will just add, and I would encourage the board members to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| When I first came on this board and I knew very little about school law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| I spent an untold number of hours in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| And of all the offices in Knox County, other than our former mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| I've never seen a more open-door policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| I was never asked to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| I was always ushered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| They would spend as much time with me as I needed going over details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| And I can see why, I'm not being critical of Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| but I can see why it would be difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| because we want the outcome to be favorable to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| to do this in a public arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| So I would just encourage the members of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| to go by on a weekly basis, every two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| whatever they feel like they need to speak with the people in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| and get updated on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| Okay, so we have a motion on the floor by Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| a second by Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| and we will have Ms. Kootenai read this and do a roll call vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| and then several have requested a break, a 15-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| before we put any other motions on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| Is everyone good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| Ms. Kootenai?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| Yes, Mr. McMillan's motion was to allow the law department to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| now that they have heard the thoughts of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| to do everything they feel possible as quickly as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| that doesn't break rules or jeopardize the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8758)|
| 2:26:06| And Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8771)|
| 2:26:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8781)|
| 2:26:22| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8782)|
| 2:26:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| And Ms. Babb, would you like to change your vote now that Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| Would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8792)|
| 2:26:40| That's five yes votes, two no votes, and two passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| All right, so we will take a 15-minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| and then come back for everyone else's motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8812)|
| 2:27:11| We are back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| So continuing on with our motions, I guess, Ms. Babb, would you like to begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8834)|
| 2:27:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| I want a little bit of clarification, I think, from Ms. Horne and from Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8843)|
| 2:27:29| I mean, I think, Ms. Christie, when you were bringing this forward on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8849)|
| 2:27:40| I really liked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| What I was thinking you were going to propose was kind of like at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| when we went to the judge asking for further exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| So I thought that was kind of the approach we were going to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| is asking for those exemptions to be added for those speech therapy kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8872)|
| 2:28:00| It kind of concerns me a little bit about the way you're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| I mean, I totally support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| I feel like there need to be more exemptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| and I don't know what your thoughts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| or even maybe from the legal department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| if we're even allowed to ask for more exemptions, medical exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| So maybe it's a question first from Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| if we're allowed to ask for more medical exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| Ms. Babb, I mean, there's nothing stopping the board from asking for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| Now, chance of success, we could certainly debate on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| but nothing stopping the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| I guess that was just what I was thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| and I guess where I want some clarification from Ms. Horne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| and from Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| because Ms. Christie has put the change of circumstance in hers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8926)|
| 2:28:52| and then Ms. Horne, are you feeling like the way Ms. Christie has done it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| covers what you wanted, or did you feel like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| I guess who are we asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| We probably need to separate these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| because I don't know that the entire board will support mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| I mean, one might have more support than the other, so we could maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| I think that would add some clarity because I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| and it's not like I'm sympathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| I think you know where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| And then one other thing I'm going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| and I think we brought this up a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| one of my concerns about the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| I think we've all talked about how obvious it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| that the circumstances have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| I know Ms. Henderson has cited a lot of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| but the Court of Appeals is not necessarily going to take any of that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8979)|
| 2:29:45| We want them to, but that's not my understanding of the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| That's not part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| and that's where I keep getting really concerned about the Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8990)|
| 2:29:54| I know there's a lot of optimism that they are going to go in our favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| and I think if it was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| if you look at the amount of states that are getting rid of mass mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| the countries that are, the cases going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| I think that does weigh very heavily for our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| But if those things are not getting considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| that's what makes me nervous on considering some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| Right, and just to speak to your concern about mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| really, and I understand that it might not get a lot of support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9024)|
| 2:30:31| but I do feel strongly about going on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| I think these kids that have been denied the mask exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| and the kids that are receiving speech services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| have really been in masks way too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| and I just feel strongly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| You know, if I get summoned to court over it, then so be it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| but I do feel ethically I can make the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9053)|
| 2:30:58| that this is what's in the best interest for these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| Now, he may not agree with me, but he would be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| but he may not agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| So I'm going to continue with that, and, you know, if it fails, it fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9067)|
| 2:31:12| and if somebody wants to bring forth something different that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9072)|
| 2:31:18| I might suggest if yours fails, to then reword,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| because I'm very sympathetic to what you put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| I don't know that I can support it in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| but I think I could support us asking for an exemption for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| to ask for an additional medical exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9096)|
| 2:31:37| Well, that's kind of what I was thinking, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| Would it be better to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| Because I've been frustrated because I feel like the medical exemptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| a lot of them that have been requested have been denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| and so especially if there's doctor's notes involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| that we're taking on the role of the doctor and that's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| How about I do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| How about I make my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9118)|
