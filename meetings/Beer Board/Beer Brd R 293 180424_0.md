| 0:05:06| Matt Beeler, 11417 Rock Springs Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| And this is for the Big Kahuna Festival, I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=311)|

| 0:05:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=319)|

| 0:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Garibaldi, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=328)|
| 0:05:38| My name is Floyd Reves, 115 South David Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=338)|
| 0:05:50| Okay. Sergeant Gower? No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| We need your sales tax registration, certificate of zoning, health department building inspection and fire prevention approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| and also your server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| You got that? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| I just had a couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| I'm looking through your documentation and was wondering if you could expand upon your server compliance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| because I did not see it included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| That will be presented with the server compliance as far as the steps to be taken to make sure that no underage folks will be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=387)|
| 0:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| And certainly I always appreciate businesses opening up in the district and here in the city at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=398)|
| 0:06:48| It is difficult, I think, for me to move to approve based on there not being any server compliance plan at all in the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=408)|
| 0:07:01| So what I would suggest is maybe delay for 30 days and make sure that you get that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| and that way we have a chance to review the entire packet before we can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Is that something you'd be willing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| We would like to open up sooner than 30 days if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| I'd be happy to present those details to you as soon as possible, like by tomorrow, if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| And this may be a question for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Having not seen a server compliance plan, is it something that we can review pending final documentation or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| Well, Councilman Roberto, generally when things are passed pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| it's things such as the building permit, fire marshal going by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| and it's either they pass or they haven't passed those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| So that makes it easier on Ms. Dyer and Mr. Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| The plan for server compliance is a slightly different animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| because what can be adequate for one type of applicant can be inadequate for another type of applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| You know, you take into account the size of a facility or the number of patrons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| or is it a one-day special event type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| I think at this point it's probably within the beer board's discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| but I think it's something that the beer board should take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| I've discussed this with Chairman Wallace about whether or not that's going to be allowed as part of final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| or if it's going to be a hard policy-like failure to get in for your background and records check before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=521)|
| 0:08:50| But at this point, if you're going to establish a policy, it needs to be applied consistent throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| whether it's for this gentleman or another applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Mr. Chairman, I don't know if you've given any thought to that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| or if we should have that discussion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| I'm a little uncomfortable with moving forward when we have no server compliance plan at all in a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| We just started accepting those last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| and there's no minimum standards that's been set on what's supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| We could establish some minimum standards that we expect to see in server compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| but we don't have that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| I think in this case you've got others, potentially you have others tonight that don't have it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| So when we go forward, we'd have to either start with this one and go forward and say from now on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| if you don't have it and it's not submitted, then it won't be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| or I'm comfortable with you taking a look at it tomorrow or however you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=590)|
| 0:09:59| But I would rather have given him and anybody else that follows him notice that if you don't have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| I think we can come up with that policy and we can state it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| I think it's probably a little unfair tonight to be able to administer it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| I would definitely agree with you that it's unfair if we come up with that policy right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| but it probably is something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| It probably is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| We'd probably set some minimum standards of what we expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| and that way when the office looks at it, they know to look for those minimum standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| so if we could agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| But it's probably another meeting other than tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Yes, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| So I actually have discussed this with Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| One question I have is what triggered us asking for compliance policies only since last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| Like what was the trigger that made that finally happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| But I would like to have some consistency or minimum standards for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| because they're all across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| and I think we need to have some kind of equity as to what we're asking for out of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| and be standardized as to when we're asking for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| whether it's going to fall in line with, you know, fire and building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| But regardless of that, it really needs to have some kind of minimum, bare minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| Bare minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| We're going to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| That's kind of where we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| That's where Frost and I got to this week in talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| I think we have to establish those and how we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| whether we have a meeting or whether we can do that by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Establish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| That's what we're still talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Let's have another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Oh, let's do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Mr. Reyes, when are you thinking of opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| When are you thinking of opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Hopefully in the next 10 to 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Okay, because there's still quite a few things that are incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| And by the end of this week, most of those will be turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| And just to add on to your concern, I completely agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| This is an experienced restaurateur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| This is his second venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| so it's not something that they're not trained to do or know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| But I'll be more than happy to give you any information you require within the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| If not by tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Well, and the issue is basically we do this approval now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| and then there's not necessarily looking back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| Maybe what would maybe be helpful is can you expand upon a little bit what the server compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| you're looking at would be for this particular restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| This is a point-of-sale system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| It's one that's going to be implemented to make sure that everybody checks all the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| Obviously, everybody will be trained to make sure that they look at the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| and make sure that if you see the red square, it doesn't get served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| So that, and make sure you have a meeting in the mornings to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| emphasize the importance to make sure that everybody gets checked for ID, everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| not just people that look young enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| But the plan is going to be that everyone who sits and asks for a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| or an alcoholic beverage will be carded no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| I'm comfortable with that, so I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Can you still get that to him tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| I mean, he'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Humane Society of Tennessee Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| They've requested deferral to the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| They have an event manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| I need a motion to defer them for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Move to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| So just hold on to that paperwork and I'm on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Hugh Linda, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=851)|

| 0:15:23| You might pull that mic down just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| You want me to repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=927)|

| 0:15:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| You're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| L&S Family Entertainment, Strike and Spare Family Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| It's Wendy Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| The address is 213 Hayfield Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| And Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| And we need the health department building inspection and fire prevention approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| and also the current permit to be surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| So similar question to last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| This time you have, there is a server compliance plan, but it's not very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| And I know we just had a discussion about making sure that we set some minimum standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| which I think is only fair to you who are making these applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| And certainly we thank you for doing business in the district and the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| Can you maybe expand upon what you were thinking of doing for server compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| We've got three sentences in the current plan, and maybe if you expand on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| it will give everyone a little bit more comfort moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Well, we were owned by S&S, which is actually the same owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| And they've been in business since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| So actually the same people that were under S&S are the same people under L&S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| So they're not new by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| They've been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| I've only been the GM there for a year, but they do know to card everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| They check IDs, and they do it by every single person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| They don't do it by the way they look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1052)|
| 0:17:42| I'm trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| I drew a blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| I don't mean to put you on the spot either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Anyway, I think that probably covers everything we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| So I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| You're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| We've got a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| This is for Broadway, so you're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| L&S Family Entertainment on the Broadway location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| It's Wendy Cox, and that address is 3315 North Broadway Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Sergeant Cowery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| And we need health inspection, building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| and fire prevention approvals and the current permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I'll just stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| You're prophetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| So this is for Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| It's Wendy Cox, and the address is 5700 Western Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| Anything else, Sergeant Cowery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Dig a little deeper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Same name, same everything, same results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Health department, building inspection, fire prevention approvals, and the current permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Thank you, Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| SWB Holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Patrick King, 811 Deary Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Sergeant Cowery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| And we need the sales tax registration, your health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| building inspection, and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| I think when we last had a discussion, there was an issue about the defined space, which you have addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| and I appreciate the timeliness of getting in the updated records, especially the map showing the service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1201)|
| 0:20:12| which made it very clear where the defined space was, so I definitely appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| We also had a discussion about some indication of who has been carded and who hasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| which you took care of with a discussion about wristbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And then the final area where we were having a discussion was about the height of the tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| and the partition wall that went around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| And if I remember correctly, the partition wall is four feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| And initially there were tables that were kind of a high-top table that were around that perimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| on the inside of the perimeter but around it, and that would make for about six inches of partition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| that you could easily pass a drink to and fro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| And you had agreed to change that so those are not high-top tables anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| They're lower, which would require, I think, about a foot and a half to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| Is that about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Correct, if you were to lower the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| And so the tables are lowered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Right, and that's on Simon being the fact that it's outside, but they have said that they're okay lowering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| Again, I remember that in our conversation you had mentioned to me that the area is under constant surveillance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| and maybe you want to expand on that a little bit for everyone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| Yeah, what should have been included in my permit set there also was a map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| or maybe I gave this but I'm happy to circulate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| This is Simon's map that they've given to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| and all I've done is indicate that there are five security cameras that are on site here that have 360-degree surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1317)|
| 0:22:05| They're actually the kind that rotate and can get full surveillance of every aspect of the food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| Those are monitoring the food court 24 hours a day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| In addition to that, something else that we discussed is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| one of the parts of our server compliance is that in the event that somehow a beer is taken outside the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| or we notice that our branded glassware is outside the premises for one reason or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| we will instruct and train our staff to instruct the person to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| If they don't comply in that extreme case scenario, we are going to instruct them then to alert security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| the mall security, in addition to alerting KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| The good thing about our location within the mall is the security dispatch office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| So if you can see this green here is the location of my kiosk within the center of the food court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| and the yellow highlighted space here is the security dispatch office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So the good news about our particular location, obviously every tenant in the mall has that ability to contact security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| but in our case we actually have the security office literally, you know, just a few steps away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| And one other thing that I remember that we probably need to chat about is the high seating area that's at the perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| on the outside facing the televisions, that is actually not in the service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| and there's a partition wall that goes in between that to make it clear to the server that you can't serve beverages outside of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Based on all of that, Mr. Chairman, I'd move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yes, pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1431)|

| 0:29:47| Let me hear your name again, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Chris Rupp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| R-U-P-P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Sergeant Cower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| We need your building inspection and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| So looking through your packet, and let's be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| We're talking about the Westtown Mall movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| So when are you planning on starting the beer service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Our goal is to open on June 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| And you've heard the discussion previous to this about server compliance plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Especially when you're dealing with the clientele that you see at Westtown Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| it becomes more, I think, difficult for us to get comfortable with not having a server compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1837)|
| 0:30:46| or not having a pretty robust one, given the amount of traffic that you have with minors that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| Do you mind maybe expanding a little on what your server compliance plan would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| We're effectively going to do the same thing we do at the other three licenses we have here in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| and that is all of our front of house, all of our guest-facing employees, regardless of their job title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| they're going to go to a state-approved, responsible server training course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| We generally use TIPS so that they'll all get their server permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| and they'll all go through that six-hour training course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| After that, our policies are that we ID everybody, regardless of their apparent age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| Unlike a traditional theater, we are operating a full-service concept here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| which means that we'll have service personnel in and out of the theaters on a regular basis throughout the performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| So people aren't just going to take the alcohol into a room and sit there in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| We're going to have service personnel that are monitoring the auditorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| so it's not just the restaurant out in the lobby that will be monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Once you get into those auditoriums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| you'll still have the same level of supervision that you would if you were sitting at a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| So we're effectively going to train everybody, regardless of their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| You have a plan in here, but again, there's not really minimum requirements that we have given you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1917)|
| 0:32:07| so I certainly don't want to be unfair in any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| A couple of things that trouble me here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| one, there is not really a defined space that's discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1937)|
| 0:32:25| Are you allowing people who purchase beer at the theater to leave the theater with the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Any of the product that we sell would be consumed inside of the theater premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| and we wouldn't allow people to bring their own into the premise either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| And then you mentioned, I think one of the other concerns that I had with this was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| you have a lot of training at the point of sale with IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| but what happens when someone goes into a dark theater with that beverage at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| Is there anything, can you expand on what you're going to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| Yeah, we'll have service staff and usher staff that are in the theaters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| and that service can be carried through into the auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| So people will be able to get refills on soda and things in the auditoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| That service staff is going to receive the same server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| They'll get their server permits from the state and do all that, as well as any of our usher staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| So even the folks that are going in and cleaning up the trash or just checking the temperature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| they are receiving responsible beverage server training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| and will be taught on what to do if they see any issues with intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| We're going to train every single employee, they're all going to be monitoring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| and we're going to have that staff in the auditoriums throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| So we're going to treat the auditoriums just like if it was the table or the bar out in the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Is there anything that is going to be obvious to an usher walking through in a soon-to-be-dark or dark auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2023)|
| 0:33:53| before a movie starts or as the movie's going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| to make it pretty clear that this person's already been ID'd, that has a beverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| or there's a particular container that is clear that this is an alcoholic beverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Yeah, our containers for soda differ vastly in appearance from our alcohol containers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| so they'll be able to notify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| And unlike a traditional theater, there are significantly fewer seats in these auditoriums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| so they're much easier to observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| You're not going to walk in and find, like, 300-seat auditoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| So it's a smaller venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| It's more of an upscaler VIP venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| And so by having the different containers and the people present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| we're going to be able to keep a much better eye on it than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| the common concern of cell phones and things in an auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| It's not going to be the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| So these are different theater auditoriums than the general auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| It's an entirely different concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| It is more of a dining restaurant theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| We're going to be able to come in and get real food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| We have a full restaurant, 90-seat restaurant out front in auditorium service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| The wait staff goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| We've got recliner seats, so there's far fewer of them than traditional seats that you'd have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| It's a substantially different concept than a traditional movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| And had you given any thought to maybe having a wristband for somebody who has been carded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| when they go at point of sale so it's much easier for the usher to know immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| I'm seeing somebody with one of these special containers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| and I don't see a wristband or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| Yeah, it's definitely something we could consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I'm happy to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Our thought process was that if you see a patron in possession of an alcohol container,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| regardless if they have a wristband or not, if they appear to be age-subject or suspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| you should be taking steps anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| We don't want somebody to be overconfident in seeing a wristband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| and not IDing somebody they otherwise should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| So that would be our only thought process there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I certainly don't want to see anything happen where you have a violation at the Westtown Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| and I know you don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| We've been serving at three locations here in town, seven in the state, and as of yet, no violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Certainly the idea about having some wristband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| and making sure that you make it very clear what the defined space is in the server compliance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| I think would make me more comfortable and may end up helping with some of the other beer board members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| Based on that, I'll move for approval on pending final documentation, but I see there's other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| You mentioned that you have some things in place so people will not take alcoholic beverages outside of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Are you going to have signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yeah, we have signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| No alcohol beyond this point, and we'll have staff in the front of house area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| that if they see patrons approaching the front exits or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| we'll intercept them and let them know that they can't take those beverages with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Just wanted to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Is it individual beers or will you have pitchers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Individual service primarily, bottled beer and draft beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Let me just double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Are we planning pitcher service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| So we'll have pitcher service, and the company policy at this time is that those are only to be sold to two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| or more people where both people are ID'd and properly vetted to be of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| So no single person will be able to come in and buy a pitcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| A couple of administrative amendments here to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2252)|
| 0:37:42| Pines Alehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| I'm Nate Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Address is 4912 Rutledge Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| This was approved subject to final documentation March 28, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| So we've been a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| We've extended it a few times, and where are we now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| We're continuing to work with the city engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Unfortunately, some of the folks that work on our site plan have recently retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| and what is kind of a chain reaction to that is that the issues that we had corrected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| and were approved suddenly got changed back to under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| So the bottom line is that our goal originally was that our establishment be at a 49-person occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2304)|
| 0:38:34| From day one, that was because of our business budget and the size of our establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| And so we thought that we had communicated that very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| Apparently, it just wasn't getting through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| So if they had told us six to eight months ago that, hey, you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| it would be in your best interest to get an architect to work on your floor plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| we would have done so, and we probably would have already been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| So we've recently hired an architect to do our floor plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| So there's currently about three weeks of work left at our establishment to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| and the architect will be submitting the new plans at the end of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| So as soon as the city gives us the green light on those plans, we don't foresee any more setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2357)|
| 0:39:26| However, we'd like to ask for one more 90-day extension just to be on the safe side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| Lauren?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Okay, so the original application was in March of 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| So if we give you a 90-day extension, we are well outside the bounds of 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2381)|
| 0:39:51| We're right at 12 months here, or past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| Is this the only documentation that this beer board has in front of them right now on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Am I missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| I didn't have anything in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| On the addendums, we don't bring you the full file back because it's already been approved subject to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| Pending, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| So it's all the pending items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Subject to these pending items, everything has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| So here's the biggest risk, if there is any risk at all, is really the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| It's the only thing that would prevent someone from getting a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| would be that something's happened in the last 14, now 18 months or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2434)|
| 0:40:45| Something would happen that would prevent them from getting a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| The two background checks were on the two individuals named here, or were there more individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| They were done a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| There's just two, me and one other owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Anything change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| I mean, we'd be happy to reestablish our background check if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| But they'd have to pay the full fee to do that, and it would have to come back in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| Well, certainly Mr. Frost should, I guess, opine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| That would, to me, would be a new consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| I'm not sure how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Well, at this point, there are really two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| It's one to grant them additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| If the beer board does not grant them additional time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| then they're going to have to reapply again and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| And they would have to pay, I'm sorry, is the business dire $250?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| But if this gentleman agreed to, you know, the background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I don't know how much it costs, but it's not $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| The background check is $3,265 per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| Because you're asking for a 90-day extension at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Could we do that, a motion pending a new background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2526)|
| 0:42:14| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| May I hate to throw a $250 fine on or not fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| Fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Those are the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Unnecessarily, but I also am not entirely comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| We're talking 15 months plus and then, yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| Well, we could grant them a 30-, 60-, or 90-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| and then say if you want another one, then before we approve another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| you'll have to do the background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| I mean, the chair and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| in one of our many conversations in the past few days about beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| the state regulates heavily those crimes that disqualify an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| from holding a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| As you noticed on the agenda tonight, there was someone that had a drug charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| but that was not a disqualifying event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| It's generally things dealing with alcohol, except for you can have a DUI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| and you're allowed to get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| That's just what the law allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| But it's certain things, you know, bad underage sales, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| or crimes of moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| So the way the state has set it, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| it's rather kind of a low bar to be eligible to get a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I mean, if this gentleman's willing to go out and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| whether it's what Councilwoman Ryder says or what Councilman Steyer says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| if he's willing to do it now or if he needs a second extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| beyond the one discussed tonight, I mean, I don't see a big issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| There are three tonight that are the same time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| Or the alternative is if you really want him to get a background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| and I'm not saying that this gentleman is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| He says, well, I don't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Well, then you don't extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And then if he wants a beer permit, he's going to have to start all over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| and definitely have to get a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| Okay, so if we issue a 90-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| it's going to be a fifth extension for this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| So 90 days, not 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Okay, then I'll make a motion to extend a 90-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| but I would not feel comfortable doing it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| That's my addendum to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Is there a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Extended 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| Clinch River Brewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Cary Shirey, 531 South Gale, Clinch River Brewing, and zip code 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| So this also was approved subject to final documentation on March 28, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| Where are you now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| We are actually making progress now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| If you've seen the property over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| they've actually gotten through the problem wall that's been causing all of the delay for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| just really getting our ducks in a row to feel comfortable going through that wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| We're looking at now, although at this point I'm almost scared to attach a year to the date that I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| I'm hoping July 1st is when we'll be opening the doors for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| The inside build-out, my builder now has assured me that it's really not that difficult of a build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| So 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| 90 days, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Again, we'll be glad to do the background check or do the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| We appreciate your patience on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| It's been trying patience for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| Again, I'd be comfortable with the 90 days, but I would not be afterwards extending any further than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| seeing it would be well over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2783)|

| 0:46:30| Lynch River Brewing, this is for the manufacturing and distribution, so it also needs 90 days, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2790)|
| 0:46:39| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| Again, Brian Shirey, 531 South Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| Yes, 90 days, it would work for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Move to approve 90-day extension with no additional extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2819)|

| 0:47:19| Christopher Morton, 1103 Sevier Avenue, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| So this was approved, final documentation, January 16th of 2018?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Where are you now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| KUB's got to hook us up with power and we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| We had to install three phase transformers in order to power the oven and the mixer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| Move to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| How many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| I should be asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| The 27th is the guarantee for KUB to us and we're going to go through a little trial and error period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| And May 8th, May 9th, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| So are you looking for a 30-day extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| So 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Move to approve a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| Ampa Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| The Bourbon Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| I see no movement for the Bourbon Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| The bird is not in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| This was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| I did speak with Mr. Pagani to inform him of the need to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| Did he say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Did he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| He seemed to indicate that he was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| That's been a couple weeks ago, so I'd imagine something could have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| I've not heard anything to the contrary, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| That was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Final documentation November 21st, 60-day extension to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| Mr. Chairman, I guess can you walk us through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| obviously there's some kind of written correspondence that goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| and there was a phone call as well advising the applicant of this hearing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| or this matter today being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Do you have any update on where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Any additional information from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| But they did have written correspondence advising them of this date and this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| as well as a phone call from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| This date they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| They had the proceeding, because it's a second extension, what this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| I didn't send one this time because I spoke with him in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| so I did not send a certified letter this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| But when you spoke with him, it was that today was the time this would be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| He was in the office on another matter, and I reminded him of the need to come today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| In the past, a lot of times what we've done in this kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| is give them 30 days, and if they don't show up twice in a row, then they forfeit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| So I guess our choices are to do that or take no action, in which case they have to apply again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| I think it's kind of difficult, given the fact that there was a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| and a discussion about it, to grant 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| But I think I'm willing to give them 30 days and go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| and we'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| But it certainly would be uncomfortable if there's two no-shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Will, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| No further business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Enjoy your next ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180424?start=3062)|
