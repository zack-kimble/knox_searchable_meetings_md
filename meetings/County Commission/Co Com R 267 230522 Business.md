|  438    |  439    | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=438.0)              |
|  439    |  441    | Welcome to the team.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=439.0)              |
|  441    |  445    | Could you go into a little bit more detail about your role and responsibilities?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=441.0)              |
|  445    |  455    | We kind of got a big picture, but since it's essentially a new position, who do you report to, and what are your objectives right out of the gate? | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=445.0)              |
|  455    |  456    | Sure.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=455.0)              |
|  456    |  460    | From a public safety aspect, of course, I report to Jenny.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=456.0)              |
|  460    |  463    | I'm under the direction of Community Development.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=460.0)              |
|  463    |  471    | Really, the Public Safety Office is going to do some coordination for the fire and rescue services inside Knox County.                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=463.0)              |
|  472    |  479    | The biggest thing is making sure our fire and rescue services are sustainable long after our careers are over.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=472.0)              |
|  479    |  488    | Small incremental changes now can mean 20 years from now our agencies are still able to provide the high level of service they do.                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=479.0)              |
|  488    |  494    | And believe it or not, those agency leaders are also concerned is a little bit of a strong word,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=488.0)              |
|  494    |  500    | but they want to know that the county wants to ensure that they're sustainable as well.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=494.0)              |
|  500    |  502    | Does that include EMS as well?                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=500.0)              |
|  502    |  505    | Well, I am not part of the EMS bid.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=502.0)              |
|  505    |  511    | Obviously, EMS is something that we also need to ensure is sustainable.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=505.0)              |
|  511    |  518    | I hope to be in conversations when that progresses a little further after some of the consulting and the contracting is released.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=511.0)              |
|  518    |  521    | Yeah, we're eminently heading in that direction.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=518.0)              |
|  521    |  523    | Yeah, and I think so.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=521.0)              |
|  523    |  526    | Unfortunately, the EMS issue is a nationwide problem.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=523.0)              |
|  527    |  531    | We see it locally, obviously, because we're exposed to it every day.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=527.0)              |
|  531    |  536    | But we are not unique with the problems that are ongoing in the EMS system.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=531.0)              |
|  536    |  540    | Our primary concern is fire and rescue services.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=536.0)              |
|  540    |  542    | And like I said, we want to ensure that they're sustainable.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=540.0)              |
|  542    |  550    | And believe it or not, those agency leaders are also, like I said, concerned as well to ensure that they're a viable resource.                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=542.0)              |
|  550    |  555    | You know, as you guys mentioned on the last meeting, we're growing.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=550.0)              |
|  555    |  558    | We've got a housing shortage, and we have people moving into the community.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=555.0)              |
|  558    |  561    | So I don't foresee those requests for those services decreasing.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=558.0)              |
|  561    |  566    | I've never seen emergency service requests decrease over the decades.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=561.0)              |
|  566    |  573    | And again, we just need to look at ways to ensure that we're doing what's right and what's best for the citizen at the least amount of money.      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=566.0)              |
|  573    |  578    | And I think that's really our number one priority once we get started.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=573.0)              |
|  578    |  579    | Thank you.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=578.0)              |
|  581    |  582    | All right.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=581.0)              |
|  582    |  585    | Seeing no more lights on, welcome.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=582.0)              |
|  585    |  587    | And we are happy that you're here.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=585.0)              |
|  587    |  588    | Thank you.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=587.0)              |
|  595    |  600    | We do not have any public forum.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=595.0)              |
|  600    |  603    | Anyone signed up for public forum for agenda items?                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=600.0)              |
|  603    |  609    | So that moves us to our next approval of minutes of the previous meeting.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=603.0)              |
|  613    |  614    | Is there a motion?                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=613.0)              |
|  617    |  618    | Second.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=617.0)              |
|  618    |  620    | I'll second that.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=618.0)              |
|  620    |  625    | Motion to approve minutes of the previous meeting by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Durrett.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-2305322-business?start=620.0)              |
