| 0:06:19| We broke a record for a new number of cases reported in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| with 118 new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=382)|

| 0:06:25| Just two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| When we last met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=386)|

| 0:06:59| other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=419)|

| 0:07:02| symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=422)|

| 0:08:22| And a few days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| the Knox County health board issued a County wide mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| That's been in effect since July 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| And I just want to say a special thank you to everybody for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| I know it's not always the most comfortable thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| but people are doing their best and, and, and every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| I see more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Adopting that. It's a simple thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| It helps mitigate the spread of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| It helps protect our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| And as you all know, and it bears repeating the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| in addition to wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| It's important to stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Wash your hands frequently disinfecting surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Practice physical distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| And stay home if you're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| These actions will help keep local businesses open and keep us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| We are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| we are working to find ways to keep employees and customers safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| And this is one reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| Yesterday I announced the temporary use of outdoor seating for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| And I just want to say thank you to all of our restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Any restaurant in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Can apply and seek to increase their capacity for outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| dining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Because a lot of people would love to patronize the businesses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| would feel safer if they could do so outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| We all know that restaurants took a huge financial hit this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| And we want to help in any way we can. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| I'm hoping that the new permit will help employees and customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| The expansion permits are available to restaurants across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=599)|
| 0:10:08| And can be for both public and private outdoor spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| And I look forward to seeing how businesses take advantage of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| new opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| I also wanted to mention that this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=614)|

| 0:11:13| Reports of council members or questions about the information I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=676)|

| 0:11:19| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| Colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| I wanted to let you know that I asked the administration earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| if they could give us a report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| For street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Painting murals. There've been a lot of questions in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| About how you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| How you get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Where that was. And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to let David brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=705)|
| 0:11:55| Give it the details of that. But, but before I turn it over to David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Thank the people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Both out in the community and all the people on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| From the police department to engineering and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| To the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| And the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Involved in the organizing of the mural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=737)|
| 0:12:27| You know, worked, worked really hard on a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| So we now have a little better clarity and I'm going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| ask Mr. Brace to elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Thank you. Go ahead, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Yeah. Thank you, mayor and members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| I appreciate the opportunity. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| There is a permit for decorative street painting within the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| And so actually there was a project in the in-skip community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| actually put that created that, that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| And, but it hadn't been looked at in a number of years. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| to be frank, it took, it took me longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Then really ideally it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Find that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| Or the group that was very anxious to implement the street painting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| I'm going to share with you a link to the city engineering website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| which is a form of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| A formal way for folks to access that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| It had only been used once in the past and then skip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| It's now available on the city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| Website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Their landing page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| I can send that link to each of you, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| It's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| The group did permit and complete the black lives matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| we actually got our arms around the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=818)|
| 0:13:47| And met with the group. We were able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| to help them get that permit. It was completed this last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| It's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Again, it is now available on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| I think this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Past weekend was a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| Any maintenance of that in the future is the responsibility of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| if there are any concerns related to that project or any project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| The city can revoke the permit. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=850)|
| 0:14:18| I do think that once we got our arms around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| we are able to work with the group, especially Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Harper, who was the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| It, it worked out well and it was permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| So that's the update. And I will send the, the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| To the, to the policy and to the application to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| And if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=873)|

| 0:14:42| I just think it's really good for us to have it out in the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| That that's all been resolved and there's a way for people to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| this in the future. If anybody wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| wants to do that because I was getting questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=896)|

| 0:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| I have Mr. Cole with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Mr. Frost, can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Do we, do we go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Does there need to be a motion on the floor for reconsideration or do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| let them have five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Not at this point, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| Council, you all may recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| We received an email from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| That the architect for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Clark was able to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| but unfortunately his attorney was not able to speak. We had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| we received some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Emails from the attorney and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| And we thought the good thing to do would be to accommodate Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| Call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| So Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| Did he have anything else that he intended to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| but was due to technology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| I can't hear you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Can anybody hear him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| So obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| I've dropped my video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I wasn't making any jokes, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Operator Eric, maybe this is what Mr. Cole's problem was, but I'll kind of recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1069)|
| 0:18:00| Mr. Cole's going to be given the opportunity tonight, he's got five minutes, to say what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| he would have said two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| If a member of council agrees with what Mr. Cole says, there can be a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1088)|
| 0:18:18| It will have to be seconded, and because it's not at the same meeting as it was previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| taken up, it will take six of you to agree to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| And then what would happen if that vote passes in two weeks, Mr. Clark's appeal is heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1109)|
| 0:18:38| by all of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| So we're not getting into the nitty gritty again, it's just to see what Mr. Cole has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| to say, if it's persuasive enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| Okay, we'll go ahead and let Mr. Cole speak, if he is able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| Mr. Cole, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| I'm on the call, can you all hear me this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| So Mr. Cole, this is Mayor Kincannon, thank you for your patience with our technical challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| and you will have up to five minutes to address city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| You can start by stating your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| My name is Robert Cole, I'm an attorney here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| My address is 2313 Pulaski Road, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1166)|
| 0:19:35| First of all, let me say that Mr. Will Johnson advised me that I was not to speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| merits of the situation, but only to speak to whether or not I should get a rehearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| And frankly, the situation is, Mr. Tomlinson is not an architect for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| He had no authority to speak for Mr. Clark at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Unfortunately, through technology challenges, just as Mr. Frost experienced some of, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1202)|
| 0:20:11| unable to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| I couldn't, oh, I was speaking a lot, but you all couldn't hear anything that I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| And that's probably good, because much of what I said was probably inappropriate, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| I was talking to my technology that was not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Everyone knows that when you attend a hearing, both sides get to present their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| They get to present witnesses and evidence and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| That's the only fair way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| And unfortunately, because of this technology glitch, I was not able to present anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| for Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| We have a lot of information to present, and a lot of what was presented was misleading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| or false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| And I do not blame the council for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| It's just, well, for lack of a better word, it's this dang virus that keeps us from meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| in regular status, such as we would have done before this in the assembly room at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| All I want is a chance so that Mr. Clark, or I can present Mr. Clark's proof that most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| of these things that were complained about have been in place for decades, and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| not caused the problems that people were discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| There has not been a single complaint from neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| This all came to the attention of the folks due to the fact that there was an encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| on KUB property, which after nearly 15 years, KUB noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| And so they proposed that Mr. Clark purchase the property that was under the encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1318)|
| 0:22:08| and demanded that a new plat be done and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| And I know the last meeting, everyone was saying that Mr. Clark created his own situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| by building these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Many of them were built when he acquired the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| And he, like most other people, didn't get out there with a hammer and nails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| He hired somebody, and ordinarily it's the contractor who goes and gets those permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| As much as I hate to say it, if they refrain from getting the permit, it just puts more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| money in their pockets, and some of those folks are a bit greedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| So I'd just like to ask you all to give Mr. Clark a fair chance to present his side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| the situation, and then you all can make the best judgment on whether there should be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| allowance for this situation or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you, Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Council members, does anyone have any questions for Mr. Cole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Is there a motion to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| I'll make the motion to reconsider the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| There's a motion by Council Member Singh to reconsider, seconded by Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Nobody's raising their hand for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Oh, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| So the discussion here was to decide whether there was reason for reconsidering, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1436)|
| 0:24:06| Can I clarify with Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=1449)|

| 0:40:11| with the last contractor but some of my concerns were that as we are you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| having a conversation as a community about you know how portions of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| community are having a different experience with law enforcement than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| others that we should carry those you know concerns into these types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2427)|
| 0:40:36| contracts and make sure that we are also requiring of those guards some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2436)|
| 0:40:44| the same abilities to work with the community when we're asking them to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| with the community as we are our own city employee law enforcement and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| that was a concern I wanted to raise up and see mix ask whether there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| measures in place some other way to hold them accountable and if not are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| there is there an opportunity to you know implement some sort of some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2469)|

| 0:41:22| when we hear of issues and concerns we validate them we go through a process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| kind of vetting those those concerns and issues if there is a problem that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| found then basically we can we can basically go through purchasing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| decide whether or not to keep that contract at any point in time so really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| we sit down and we give them chances to kind of work through those issues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2499)|

| 0:42:11| really look at that would be during recreational events basketball games for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| example to make sure that those guards have the training and the de-escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=2538)|

| 1:45:45| Black Lives Matter mural being a historical land site. I want to take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| time to talk to you to explain the importance of the mural and the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| to me as a gay black woman here in America. I'm going to just briefly talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| to you about a couple of things I've experienced and the trauma I've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| through. Um, just living here in this state, you know, just going for a walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| here, like in South Knoxville, you know, just being called in word by these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| random men that I don't know and then not being able or feeling like I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| acknowledge that without being considered the angry black woman that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| this country has placed a stereotype upon me. And I feel like I need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| able to speak up without it being problematic, you know, and just when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6385)|
| 1:46:32| something's wrong, let people know that. And another example, me sitting at a bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| I was completely sober, and I was approached by an FBI agent who bullied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| me and harassed me. And when I looked around, I realized I was the only black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| woman in that bar, the only black person. And it nearly almost brought me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| tears. And so she just kept staring me down, just questioning me, and I got up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| and I left. And those are just two examples of me. And I should be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| sit down and not be harassed by an FBI agent. And I should be able to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| how I feel. And I'm tired of being told how I feel by those who don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| it's like. And I need to, we need to normalize supporting the black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| community and respecting one another. And we need to face the issue at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| head on and do something as simple as supporting the Black Lives Matter mural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| without giving the black community a hard time about it. And as mayor, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| something for this community that you would do for yourself that you would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| for your loved ones, do something that will make a difference for the black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6455)|

| 1:48:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| My name is Amelia James 1939 Fairwood Ave. First of all, I'm really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| disappointed in this council's attempt to limit public forum, you should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| excited that so many Knoxvillians want to engage in important community issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| I want to thank specifically Amelia Parker and Charles Thomas for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| encouraging public comments. And I hope that you all take your job seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| And that listening from Knoxvillians is should be one of the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| parts of your job. I had a lot more to say today, but I guess I'm going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| to limit my comments and send this in an email. I want to echo what some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| have said about the proposal to hire social workers to create a first response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| team. And first, I wanted to highlight that a licensed clinical social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| is someone who has completed a two year master's program, which includes 900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| clinical hours, an additional 3000 clinical hours and 100 hours of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| supervision, along with passing two board exams. When you compare that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| Tennessee's required 480 hours of basic training for police, I hope it becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| obvious why we cannot train police to be social workers. And the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| cahoots in Eugene, Oregon, is a phenomenal model, I believe Los Angeles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| County is actually adopting that model. So there's no reason that Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| can't do that, too. And when asked in an interview, what she brings to respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| a call crisis responder Ebony Morgan said, the tools that I carry are my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6574)|

| 1:49:43| knowledge of our local resources and how to appropriately apply them. I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| any weapons, I've never found that I needed them. And Kahoot saves Eugene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| Oregon $15 million a year. And like Alex said, there have been no injuries. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| wanted to take a moment American Canon to speak directly to you. I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| disappointed by your lack of support for Black Lives Matter in the past few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| weeks. There are many white progressives who like to say the right thing, but when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| it comes to risking their own reputation, they are unwilling to act. And I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| speak to you as a white woman. White women have traditionally been dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| and unsafe for the black community because we present as allies that in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| end are unwilling to use our own tremendous privilege to dismantle white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| supremacy. You have the opportunity here as mayor to leave a legacy of justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| and to know that you are part of creating a more equitable Knoxville by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| partnering with black community members and taking decisive anti-racist action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| Or you can continue talking about systemic racism while still catering to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| racist groups and doing nothing to dismantle white supremacy. And if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| your choice, we look forward to electing another mayor in years to come who will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| bravely partner with us to achieve racial justice. The time to say the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| thing has passed. We need to actually take action that protects all people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| Knoxville, not just white people. And I hope everyone on city council is taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| this incredibly seriously and looking at how Knoxville can become a safer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| more equitable place for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| Thank you. Next person signed up to speak is Mr. Rick Roach. Mr. Roach, are you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6679)|

| 1:51:34| have up to three minutes. Rick Roach, Knoxville, Tennessee. A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| Firstly, everyone's talking about and mentioning what's gone on as regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6701)|
| 1:51:49| the Black Lives Matter mural and I participated both weekends. It was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6709)|
| 1:52:00| wonderful experience, a community-building experience, an opportunity to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| people, hear what they had to say, what they were feeling. I'm sorry that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6728)|
| 1:52:16| were not able to make it on the second weekend there. You would have enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| As regards what could be considered an essential element of community building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6742)|
| 1:52:33| city council, you need to start thinking forwardly in terms of a new way of doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| things in terms of residential housing. You have a chance here to actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6759)|
| 1:52:49| incorporate through community development the concept of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6769)|
| 1:52:57| land trust. Do your homework. I'm not going to talk about the basic elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6777)|
| 1:53:04| but do your homework, look it up, read about it, read about the different models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| that have been employed. It's something that definitely can work in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| and would be an essential tool to empower the communities such as East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6795)|
| 1:53:22| Knoxville, McCannsville, Lonsdale, and other communities in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6802)|
| 1:53:33| helping to solidify and expand the housing market. Also for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| purposes, we also need to be having council you need to, and mayor, you really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6819)|
| 1:53:48| need to be a little bit more transparent as regards all the monies that have come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| through the CARES Act and are being distributed throughout Knoxville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6835)|
| 1:54:02| Knox County. And the counting of all of it, a detailed accounting is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| That's it. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Roach. Next person is Kent Minow. Mr. Minow, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6850)|

| 1:54:51| historical status to the Black Lives mural on Martin Luther King Boulevard. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| think it's a phenomenal movement that's sweeping the country and I'm old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| enough to remember previous movements for racial justice in the 60s and 70s in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| which I participated and many of those movements were obstinately repulsed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6906)|
| 1:55:14| violently repressed and there's been a little violent repression of this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| too. But positive suggestions like getting our own version of the Cahoots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6918)|
| 1:55:25| movement here in Knoxville, these are terrifically positive policy suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| and I think real history is being made. It's being made in lots of cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| around the country and it's being made here. So if history is being made, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| make it historical with a marker at 2800 Martin Luther King Boulevard. Thanks so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=6939)|

| 1:56:57| meaningful. Putting it in front of Jarnagans, one of the oldest black-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| businesses in Knoxville, to me that's meaningful. The Black Lives Matter mural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| is action that will bring empowerment and morale to our people. It's not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| photo ops. It's not about putting it in white people's spaces so that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| be comfortable and travel to those spaces to see it. We already know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| they see Black Lives Matter and either they are going to get it or they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| So for me it is not for them. It is for us, our community, to enjoy. For us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| celebrate. For us to participate and also be reminded that Black Lives Matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| right outside of our door. So therefore the Black Lives Matter mural needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| stay and it needs to be also considered to being an historical landmark right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| Knoxville, Tennessee. Thank you. Thank you. Any of the previous people who signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7065)|

| 1:58:00| Mayor, I don't see anyone else. Okay. Council members, I just want to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| moment to clarify a couple things. A lot of the comments I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7085)|
| 1:58:15| are a gross mischaracterization of how the city and how I as mayor handled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| project. As you know, we on council and I as mayor represent the entire city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| Knoxville and we also have processes in place and trust me that if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7105)|
| 1:58:34| weren't supportive of the effort to paint this project, the street barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| would not have gone up. We cooperated in every way as fast as possible. We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| very little notice of the endeavor and at the last minute we tried to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| everything we could. The permit wasn't granted because they didn't fulfill the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| the requirements in time but we let the project go on and then the permit was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| they finished the process and while we waived many of the requirements, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7141)|

| 1:59:15| community support from the people who live right there and that takes a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| bit of time and when they had a few days to do it, they got it done and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| were happy to work with them and get the process, get the permit granted. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7166)|
| 1:59:32| just wanted to sort of make sure council members had a little more accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| information on that and if you ever have any questions, obviously you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| how to reach me. That concludes public forum and unless there's any objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200714?start=7183)|
