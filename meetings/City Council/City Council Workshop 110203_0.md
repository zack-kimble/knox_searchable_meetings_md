| 0:03:05| with a workshop related to minority contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| and we're going to follow, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| the following agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| to accomplish this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| First, we're going to have a brief presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| by Boyce Evans from the city purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| that will talk about the city's policies at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| We will have a brief presentation by Jocelyn Hunley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| the Title VI coordinator for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| We will have a brief presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| by the Minority Contractors Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| by Zimbabwe Matuvu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Sorry if I mispronounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| And then we will have council discussion following that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| and if there are others who wish to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| then council may choose at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| whether you want to hear from additional speakers or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| So, to start it off, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| My name is Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| I live at 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| and I am the purchasing agent for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| And let me go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| The purpose, really, right now is to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| you can read the statement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| but it's really threefold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| We want to explain to you where we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| on reaching our goal of conducting 10% of our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| with minority and women-owned firms combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| describe our efforts to move us forward in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| and then to solicit ideas potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| for further improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| The next slide, page three there, shows you the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| I'll be covering the first half there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| under purchasing division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| and Jocelyn and I have worked together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Ms. Hundley will pick up the piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| from the Community Relations Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Okay, the first slide of substance, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| is the one up there entitled Situation as of June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| And that shows you where we were at the end of FY10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| And I just want to point out a few things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| You can see the, well, great, turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| The middle line there that ends in FY10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| it's 6.34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| That's representative of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| having done 6.34% of its business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| with women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| And that's just a little bit over $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| And that's the highest ever in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| The one that we are particularly concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| is the minority-owned business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| the bottom line on the graph there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| which is only 2.35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| And that represents $1.8 million at the end of FY10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| And then in reaching the goal, you combine the both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| and that gives you your top line of 8.68%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| which is about $6.85 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| I do want to point something out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| that's never been brought out in any of the reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| that I've given to you, and it's not on the chart there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| And that is that we don't take much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| out of what I'd call the spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| In other words, to get these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| in other words, for the minority-owned one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| you say 1.8 million divided by some number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| That number in this case was around 78,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| almost $79 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| And when I say we don't take much out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| we start off with the city's whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| their whole expenditures, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| We back out payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| We back out benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| We back out sole source procurements, easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| land acquisitions, things that can't be competed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| What we keep in there, though, I want just to let you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| is a lot of things, frankly, that a lot of my contemporaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| and other agencies take out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| And that is things like banking services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| from these large banks that we do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| We have to do business with large ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| because they're the only ones capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| to conduct the type of transactions that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| and the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| We also keep in there insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| like with Blue Cross Blue Shield Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| and those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| There's a lot of other entities out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| that take those out because they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| well, there's no woman-owned firm in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| that could offer these type services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| or no minority-owned firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Our philosophy has been that may be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| but there never will be unless people focus on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| and keep that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| So I do want to put that out there to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| So, you know, our numbers could possibly be considerably higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| if we had those in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| or had those out of the denominator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| but we keep them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| The other thing I wanted to let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| is I just took a peek at the mid-year of FY11 report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| and frankly, the news is not all that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| I mean, the economy's taking its toll, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| is the only thing I can say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| At the mid-year report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| we're looking at, well, small businesses in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| have gone from 15.5% this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| down to 11.26% at the mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| And based on the reading that I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| and talking to my contemporaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| you know, you've got, well, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| you've got a lot of small businesses leaving the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| because they can't withstand the way it's been for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| and they don't have the staying power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| that a lot of the big ones do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| And you've also got situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| where large companies are competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| for the smaller projects they did not necessarily put into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| I see that at pre-bids and pre-proposal meetings all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| I don't know, am I supposed to serve when I see a light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Am I supposed to stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I'm going to ask counsel if that's how they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| Would you like to go ahead and get through your presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| and then take questions, or do you have a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Probably both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Take them now and then toward the end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| I was going to hold off general questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| but on this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| is the pink or woman-owned business line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| exclusive of minorities or blacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Whether you're a woman or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| you might be in the minority line itself if you are a minority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| and the women line is only women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| who are not part of a minority category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| If it is a minority-owned women firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| put it in the minority-owned firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| We do not double-count that firm then again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Yeah, I was concerned about do the numbers overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| No, we do not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| On the next slide here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| this is the first of three slides that talk to some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| and these are the more significant initiatives that we have taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| The next slide will be the ones that we are taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| and then the next one will be future initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| to increase the amount of business we conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| with disadvantaged business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| The first one there was key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| It was back in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| We put in a section in the Code of Ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| dealing with disadvantaged business enterprises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| and that had never been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| What did that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| That did things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| First off, it defined what is a minority-owned business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| what is a woman-owned business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| what is a small business, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| It required the Purchasing Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| to actively solicit bids, proposals, and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| from disadvantaged businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| It codified the 10% goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| It required us to provide you and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| and top management at the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| and I think it even goes public at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| how we're doing twice a year now in regard to reaching that goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| things that have not been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| So we felt like that was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Also, the second bullet there, twice a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| we do show the departments how they are doing or not doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| as the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| in the operations group meeting with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| and all the senior directors on striving to meet the goal of 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| The intent there, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| is to encourage the ones that aren't doing it well to do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| and it has some effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| The last one there is something we've done more recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and that is we have begun allocating as much as 10 points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| 10 out of 100 points, to RFPs and RFQs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| for prime contractors that have a sound plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| for employing small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| as either subcontractors or subconsultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| The sounder your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| the more business you plan to sub out to those type entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| the more of those 10 points you receive and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| So that is something that we have really recently done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| particularly with regard to RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| The next slide here on ongoing slash recent initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| these are things that are going to occur this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| A couple of them we've done in the past, some of them not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| That top one there, that business breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| we've held that for two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| We're going to hold it again this June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Some of you have been, but the ones that haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| just to give you an idea of what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| we're over here to the foundry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| and right as the budget is about to be released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| we have the various directors describe to the businesses in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| what projects, what bids, and so forth are coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| what all they pertain to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| in some cases even how much money there might be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| and more importantly, when that is going to come out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| The whole intent is to enable the business community to posture themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| to compete for those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| Yeah, any type of business can show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| but frankly the target audience is your small minority and women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| Those are the ones we call up, we invite, we send mail to, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| The next one there is also crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| It's the East Tennessee Business Matchmaking Event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| We've held that in Rothschilds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| It's actually put on by the East Tennessee Purchasing Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| but the city of Knoxville has been a main driver in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| for two years running and is this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| In fact, I was the president of ETPA last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| so I definitely got to drive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| What we do is we get all kinds of government entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| We had the city of Chattanooga there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| We had a pseudo-government entity, B&W Y-12, Johnson City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| all around here with the KCDC, Knoxville, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| We get a lot of private corporations, the large ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Pilot, Covenant Health, Children's Hospital, UT, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| Anyway, they show up and we match their buying needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| over about an 18-month period to what the smaller companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| have turned in to us and said that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Then we set them up throughout the day in a series of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| 10-minute appointments where they can sit down with the buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| from those entities and explain what goods and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| they have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| It has had as much as 750 to 800 people that attended it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| It's growing each year, and it's because, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| there's some awards of purchase orders and contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| that do come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| It's a good thing, and it doesn't cost those that participate a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| It's paid for by the matchmakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| My point is, though, probably I haven't had enough advertising on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| but the city of Knoxville has been a big driver in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| The other thing we do is Miss Bennett over here to my left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| Sherry, does weekly conduct cold calls to minority-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| and women-owned businesses to tell them what's up for bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| what's out there, or something that may be coming up in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| to garner their interest and hopefully get them to turn in a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| I asked her the other day, hey, how many have we done in a while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| She handed me a stack of papers like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Each of these pages consists of an individual call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| usually four calls to a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| She does that all day every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| We do not do that for the businesses that look like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| male, white, Caucasian-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| We do that for the minority-owned and the women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| We also distribute that list of disadvantaged business enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| to the various departments so that they can use those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| when they have small purchases to make, i.e. under $5,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| That's crucial so that they know who they can go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| The last one there is something that this body recently voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| and truly appreciated it, and that is when we move the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| from $4,000 to $5,000 for small purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| and from $10,000 to $25,000 for the competitive bid threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=995)|
| 0:16:45| And, yes, sir, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| I see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| I'm just not used to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Mr. Dell, help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| I think he's getting to the point I was curious about, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| we're trying to make it less onerous for small contracts for people to bid on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| without going through a lot of really heavy-duty kind of bid analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| bid work that they might have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| And let me just, thanks for, that is what I'm getting to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| And I just wanted to, using the old data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| you remember where $4,000 was the small purchase threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| I ran the numbers from FY10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Twenty-seven percent of the business under $4,000 went to small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| Now, when you upped it between $4,000 and $10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| where we were required to get three quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| it drops to 19% of those were small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| The larger purchases that required competitive sealed bids, $10,000 and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| it drops to less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| So right there, 27%, 19%, less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| What that tells me, I mean, is that the less you have to go through, like you just said, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| the procurement process, you know, bids and bonds and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| and frankly, the better small businesses do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| And the reason it's important, we're talking minority-owned firms to a large extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| The reason small businesses are important is 89% of the minority-owned firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| that conduct business with the city of Knoxville are also in the small business category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| So when you're getting to small businesses, you're getting to minority-owned firms in large measure, almost 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| Additionally, women-owned businesses that have registered to conduct business with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| 66% of those also fall into the small business category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| So when you're talking small business, we're talking minority-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| and women-owned firms in large measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| So I think adjusting of those procurement thresholds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| not only increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the purchasing division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| and getting stuff to the departments quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| but it helps the small business community to include minority- and women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| I'm picturing large corporations that have two or three people maybe that do nothing but manage bids and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| If you're a small business, you're a hands-on kind of guy that's doing a little paperwork on the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| and you don't have a team to just fill out all that paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| It takes a long time to, I mean, you've got to sit down and figure out a lot of different things before you can turn in a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1162)|
| 0:19:31| If you're going to be competitive and also make money, walk that fine line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| On the next slide there, future initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| These are some things that we are working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| The first one is something I've got right in my inbox and I am pushing to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| and I'll get it done shortly, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| And that is to set some citywide goals for small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| And I want to bring back some recommendations to the Equal Business Opportunity Program Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| and Josh will talk more about them in a minute, so that we can come up with some goals and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| get them to the mayor and so forth for what we really ought to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| And then once we set those, then we can move to the next bullet there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| setting some specific departmental goals for, you know, small minority-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| and women-owned business for the, instead of just saying 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| In other words, 10% may make good sense to, like, I don't know, the public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| but it may not make any sense to parks and rec, which traditionally does much higher than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| And then you may have engineering when they get into professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| and frankly there's just not that many, for instance, minority-owned professional service companies around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| If they are, I need them pointed out to me because we're not finding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| There's just not that many, so 10% to them is meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| They're never going to get there, at least not in the short run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| So we need to tailor those goals to something that is reasonable, feasible, and achievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| The last one there is of great interest to us, and I don't think you've been told about this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| And that is we, about a month ago, put out a request for proposals to get a contractor or, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| a consultant to help us increase the amount of bids, proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| and statements of qualifications that we get from the minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| And the reason we did that is, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| they're just not competing to the extent that we would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| In FY10, this past FY, out of 603 bids, proposals, statements, qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| only 41 of them came from the minority-owned firms, 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| And that's 6.8% of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| We're never going to get to 10% if we can't up the amount of competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| that we get from that sector of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| So what we're wanting to do, and what we've written the RFP to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| is get a consultant to assist us in determining why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| Why is it that we're not getting the bids and proposals from that sector of the business community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| And then to develop an action plan based on whatever that rationale is to help us do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| And if everything is still tracking, in other words, we believe, yes, they have unearthed the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| and, yes, they have a sound action plan, to assist the city then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| either in whole or in part, in implementing that action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| Bottom line, we want to have more proposals and bids from the minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| And making cold calls and the outreach efforts and so forth that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| well, frankly, we're doing a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| but it's not having the effect that we'd like it to with that section of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| And I will tell you one disclaimer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| That is not fully funded at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| The evaluation committee is going to have to look at it and see is there truly value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| In other words, out of the proposals that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| are there some proposals here that would probably, based on their qualifications, experience, and plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| going to get us to where we need to be or where we would like to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| If there are, Mr. York and Mr. Martin, I'll go back to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| and they're fully aware of what we're doing here, and we're going to try to get some money to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| But it is not allocated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| You won't find a budget line for it is where I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| The last slide I'm going to leave you with before I move on and turn it over to Jocelyn is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| we're not where we want to be, but I just wanted to give you an idea of how, anyway, the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| their master's degree program, MBA students, stacked us up after looking at a whole lot of different cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| and different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| And as you can see, like I say, we're not where we need to be, but we're not all that bad either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| Just kind of food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| I do want to leave you with this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| The reason you see places like Lexington, Little Rock, and Roanoke on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| we had to go out of the state is because, much to my surprise at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| most of the cities and the counties in this state do not even track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| I'm talking about bigger places, too, Johnson City, Chattanooga, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| and a lot of the counties all over the place just don't track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Frankly, in most cases, they're not staffed to track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| I've got a small business specialist, Sherry, that works in purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| and works hard on track of that, so at least we know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| But, you know, if you don't have somebody that's dedicated to looking at that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| you really can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| So I'm not slamming them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| I just want to let you know that, yeah, we're not where we want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| but when you stack it up, we're not all that terrible either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| And I guess with that, yes, sir, Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Yeah, but before you leave, that category that has the X in it, sliding scale RFP points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| that's not singing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| What is that talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Okay, I guess it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| I should have spoke to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| A sliding scale is if you have a discount for, let's say if we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| Nashville is the only one I know of in the state of Tennessee that has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Nashville or Metropolitan, Davidson County, whatever it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Your up to ten points thing you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| No, no, no, sir, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| It is, hell, I made a copy of it in the back of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1561)|
| 0:26:11| It's going to take forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| I made a copy of theirs at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| Okay, can you hit the full size so I can see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| In this instance, if there is a bid out there or something they're buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| look all the way to the top of the chart up there that is between zero and $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| If, as I understand it, you are a small business that has to be race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| and gender neutral in Davidson County, then you would get a 15% discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| In other words, if you bid $100 for whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| you would be evaluated as if you had only bid $85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| Now, you would get paid $100 because that was what you wrote down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| but you would be evaluated because you were small and in Davidson County at $85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| And then, as you can see, the scale, the percent of the discount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| decreases as the price range goes up until finally a million dollars or above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| there is no discount because it's cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| So that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| They get credit against their bid for being a small business in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| In that county, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Penny, if you can take me back to where I was, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| And the only reason Nashville did real good there was they're the only ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| to my knowledge anyway, and to UTs at that time in the state that had something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| The other piece there we have implemented since that UT study is allocating points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| in the RFP process for if the prime has a sound plan for bringing in small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| as consultants or subcontractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So I think if they were to do it over again, we'd probably get a check there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| We've implemented one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| We hadn't implemented the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| And I'll just tell you, my thoughts on that since we're there is something like that is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| premature at this point, that sliding scale, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| because we don't have enough data from minority-owned business community to know whether there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1711)|
| 0:28:40| truly a disparity between, in other words, if I'm a minority-owned firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| what percent chance do I have of winning a bid as opposed to if I'm a women-owned firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| We don't have enough data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| We don't know if it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| And there would be costs associated with it and a whole lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| It's a little premature before we even really seriously consider something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| If I could ask you one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| You mentioned a consultant, and you were wondering if that was going to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I have no idea what you're talking about, but it sounds like $20,000 or $30,000 minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| I would think, to get someone on board to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| What about sort of roundtables where you invite minority businesses in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| hey, why aren't you all bidding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Tell us what are the obstacles you're running into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| How about kind of a get-together that gets right to the source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and asks those kinds of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Maybe set up a coffee and Danish hour once a month or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| I'll just be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Some folks from the Equal Business Opportunity Program Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| and I and Jocelyn kind of talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| And, frankly, I don't know that we'd get a good candid answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| because when people are looking at me or they're looking at Sherry or they're looking at Jocelyn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| they see the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| We're spokespersons for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| And so, you know, your sincerity is brought into question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| particularly if you're somebody that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| If you're in that category of I don't want to do business with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| and they've already got their minds made up, you know, if that was a perception or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| So an outsider produces candor, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Well, one of the no, that's not what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| In fact, one of the I think 15 of the evaluation points in that particular RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| was going to be that you have already got solid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| well-established relations in the Knoxville minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| It would need to be somebody that was respected within that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Mr. Whithall has been waiting patiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| But an outside consultant would produce candor because they're, as you just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| I mean they're going to sit in a room and some of the minority business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| are not going to say directly to you perhaps some things that we need to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| because they don't want to offend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| It might seem too challenging, but it's something we definitely want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| because those businesses may be entertaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| You may be entertaining bids from them, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| I think you're true. I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| The only thing I can bring it back, I just looking at that chart reminded me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| when the UT students were going around and one of the things they looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| is how well we were doing internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| So they started talking to the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Well, they got a whole different position from the department directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| on how we were doing than when I would go and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| That's just the way people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Every now and then somebody might tell you the unvarnished truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| That's usually somebody you don't want to talk to all that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I mean I appreciate your interest in an outside consultant to try to get it to the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| of what are some of these environmental challenges that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| When we're talking about small business, what do we mean by that term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| I mean is it a certain number of employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| I thought I had everything with me in backup, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| It is stratified by there's a certain amount of employees that you can't go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| There's a certain amount of gross revenue or sales that you can't bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| There's thresholds in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Those are two of the areas, and they're broken out by type of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| For instance, the construction industry, you're probably going to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| a whole lot more money than maybe a small mom and pop, you know, retail type situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| But to get my brain around it, would you say anything underneath 100 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| would be small business or 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| I wish I had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| I think it's smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| That's one of the things we've also been looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Now that you mentioned it, Mr. Martin, the boss, when he first looked at our definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| he told me, he said, hey, Evans, I think it's probably a little too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| And sure enough, we compared it against the, like, I think the Small Business Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| what they have as it, and we were smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| We probably need to expand the definition somewhat so it's in a more accepted realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| We've got some work to do in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| But suffice to say, it is, you know, how many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| How much gross revenue do you bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| There's one other category, and I can't think of it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you, Mr. Evans, for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| I want to ask you, when you do the cold calls and you have the breakfast, the invitations and people that you call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2016)|
| 0:33:45| where do you get, is that list updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| How do you know who to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| And is that list updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Ms. Bennett does update that list constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| We send it out about twice a year to the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| It's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| In other words, somebody is always going out of business or coming in that we didn't know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| and she'll usually highlight the businesses that are new on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| I guess what I'd say is we do our best to keep it updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| You know, are there errors in it from time to time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| The information you have here, is this specific to Knoxville only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| or do you include surrounding areas as far as minority businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| We go to Knox in this, I guess I'd call it the ten surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| That's really what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| In other words, we're not looking necessarily at, I don't know, Atlanta or Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| or someplace, you know, pretty far away from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Did I miss it, or do you all utilize the state's list of minority vendors as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Because they have a very comprehensive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| On some of our purchases, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| When we have a pretty good list of local businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| then I try to utilize as much as possible our local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| But if it's not a very good list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| then I will go to the state's website and look at their list of small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| or minority and women-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| Professional services definitely might fall in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| We really struggle in that area around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| It's just a good resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| I'm wondering if it's the same thing with, like, the lab in Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| and the DOE's office, their small disadvantaged business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Do you ever talk to those folks, Trevor, some of those folks down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| Because I would assume one of the problems is when you have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| you really don't have the small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| Locally, they don't offer those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| So you have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| but you don't see a local company that provides those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| and that's probably the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| If I could shift the response from Ms. Bennett to Ms. Owens for a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| We hijacked her from the ORNL, and she has helped us in that endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| We know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Just so we can keep the record correct, if you don't mind, when you join in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| would you please state your name first and your position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| I'm Penny Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| I'm the contract manager in purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| And, yes, especially with the lab, being a former employee there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| I have a lot of people that I can talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| With the matchmaking event specifically, that was one which I've been really involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| So we went to them to get their small business list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| and we've contacted them to get lists of small businesses from them on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| Are there any other questions at this point for Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| I was just noticing the comparisons of Nashville, which, of course, has three goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| or two goods and three excellents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I don't know exactly, of course, how the criteria was arrived at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| but would you have any idea of why Nashville is rated so highly or what they're doing that we're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| I think on the ‑‑ I've spoken to the sliding scale, but also the interactive website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| I believe they have a system in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| As I understand it, that email, through email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| automatically notifies businesses of when a certain bid comes up where they have products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2257)|
| 0:37:47| and services that they offer that fall into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| We are working on such a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| We've got the first step done, which is you can register to do business with the city online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| but we have not got the piece implemented so that it generates the automatic emails yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| That's supposed to be by this summer sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| That will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| That's one of the ongoing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| And, frankly, that will help us a whole lot, particularly in terms of the cold calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| That will free Sherry up, in other words, to make some of them, but to do a lot of other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| So we're anxious to get that going full bore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| So the MBA students determined that these five tools are the key tools for accomplishing the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| They're pretty fundamental, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| That was their ‑‑ it was that entrepreneurial business aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| the program they've got over there run by Mr. Swift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| They really had a good team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| They did a thorough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| We're still going to explore maybe there are other tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| I just threw this up here as a means of just kind of a snapshot in time, a little bit dated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| but, you know, because I'll be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I mean, going back here, you know, when I look at that bottom line right there, 2.35%, I'm not happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| I don't like it, and I want to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| So that's the bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| But what I wanted to tell you was this bad news that that is, you know, comparatively speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| we're not bringing up the rear of the formation either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| You're talking about Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| Would they send like an alert blast that we're having a bid next week that's set aside for small contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| or that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Is that what they're doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| They're blasting out to recipients, wake up, something's on the radar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| It works like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| When you register in one of these municipalities with them that have this type database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| and let's say I sell, I don't know, I've got architectural engineering services, and I get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| Well, when the purchasing division finally gets through an RFQ or a letter of interest that's going to go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| when that thing gets posted to their normal website or in paper or whatever else they do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| also their system automatically generates e-mails to all those people who filled out that they provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| architectural engineering services, and they get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| And that's real important for small businesses because of wake up call here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| There's one right on the radar, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Because the small businesses, generally speaking, don't have people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| They're not staffed to go to all these websites and look for that like the larger corporations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| I mean, when we have a big project out there, a multimillion-dollar project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| we get calls from San Diego, Honolulu, and it's just from people looking at the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| But your small businesses, they could be right here in town, and unless we call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| they're not going to know about it, or unless they read it in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| Councilman Woodhall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| One quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Let's say you get the consultant, and that consultant comes to you and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Mr. Evans, you're doing a terrific job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| It just so happens, though, that you have a community that is not real friendly to people who are not white males.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| What are you going to say to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| Call up the action plan to deal with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| That's my next response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Now, identify the problem, or the situation, and then identify the action plan to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| That's what you're being paid to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Mr. Evans, you have an approved vendors list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Can a company apply to become an approved vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| and then, therefore, see requests when they come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| No, they will not automatically see requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Whether you are, well, let's just take one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| One that's got, I was talking architectural engineering, Vaughn & Melton, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| has got quite a few because they do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| But we don't call up Vaughn & Melton and tell them, or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| even though they are a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| I don't know that we have approved vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| We have vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| You take Oak Ridge or TVA or I'm sure the state of Tennessee, the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| When they have an RFP that goes out, they send that to companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| especially small and disadvantaged businesses, and through a disadvantaged business office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| they'll go out to those contractors and say, we have a scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| And then they respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| They say, hey, we want to go after this, and then they respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And, you know, I'm just, when you say you look at that chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| and you say that, you know, you're not happy with two and a half percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| I'm just wondering if you've come to any conclusion why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| Because I've got some real ideas why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I think it goes back to not receiving in the number of bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| and proposals and so forth that we would like to from that sector of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| I mean, if we're not getting the bids and proposals in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| then we're never going to be able to do the amount of business that we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| with a minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I mean, that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Now, why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| I've got my own ideas on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| I can speculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| I mean, if you ask me, I would say, you know, I've heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| I've heard there's a perception out there that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| the city knows who they want to do business with, there's no sense even trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| Nothing could be further from the truth, but that is a perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| Then there's also the perception of, well, government's too big for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| there's no sense in even fooling with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Again, wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| You know, but I would like to get somebody to get us a better opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| You know, again, I'm just speculating, worth what you just paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| I'd like to get somebody in here that would be able to get that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Because, you know, we've been down this path since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| You know, when 203 or whatever we started, the Haslam administration initiated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| and, you know, when you see 2.35, you know, we're not getting anywhere with it, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| And I'm just trying to figure out, like, with the ESCO contract, Amoresco won it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| I wonder what the minority participation is in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Because I'm aware of a lot of companies that do that type of work around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Amoresco, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but they have done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| Do you remember what they were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| I mean, is it close to 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| It is close to 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| We had long talks with them before they ever came on board and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| you will do your best in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Obviously, don't, you know, go to the poorhouse because you're trying to meet the goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| but give us your best effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| When we do have a large contract, that's an easy one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| because those companies can go out and actively pursue small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| And we make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| We do make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Further questions for Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Seeing none, thank you very much, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| And we'll go now to the Title VI coordinator, Jocelyn Hunley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2739)|
| 0:45:48| I'll state my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Jocelyn Hunley, 6109 Rivers Run Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2751)|
| 0:46:02| Monitoring and evaluation of the report that is submitted by the purchasing department is driven by the Title VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| EBOP coordinator, which is me, and I answer to the community relations director, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| The EBOP is a remedial action program of Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| And just for your refresher course, Title VI is a civil rights act of 1964 that states that no person shall be discriminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| on the grounds of race, color, national origin, or be excluded from participation or be denied benefits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2787)|
| 0:46:36| or subjected to any discrimination whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| The Equal Business Opportunity Program actually was created in 1999 by executive order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| and there are five components to this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| Today I will briefly explain each area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| There were several resources utilized to create this program and to list a few influential references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2824)|
| 0:47:13| These here listed are not – this is only a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Several programs and documents will be viewed to assist in the creation of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| This program has only had two employees, and I am the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| The program utilizes the Equal Business Opportunity Program Advisory Committee to the greatest extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2846)|
| 0:47:36| And I believe one of the council persons mentioned having a panel of minority input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| These individuals provide us with firsthand knowledge of existing business constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| candid complaints and suggestions, heartfelt concerns, and some innovative ideas on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| They come before us and assist us in ensuring that we can continue to provide open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| and transparent government, and we certainly do appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2885)|
| 0:48:13| Creation of the Minority Women's Small Business Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| As you can see, in this particular program, we wanted to make sure that each contract, request for proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| request for qualification, encouraging partnership and joint ventures was a significant piece of this particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| We try our best to ensure that that happened by making sure that all our contracts include a good faith inclusion plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| and that all our RFPs and qualifications do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| We also include in these particular contracts specific forms for our contractors to comply with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| and they're held accountable and bids are sometimes turned away because they have not submitted this particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2932)|
| 0:49:02| The certification component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| The certification component, as you see, we do it once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| Anyone can apply for this particular certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| There is a certification directory that is accessible via our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| If you go to our website, you can actually view this certified directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| There's also a small business directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| This is a voluntary directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| Some vendors don't want to be included for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| Nonetheless, it's open to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| If you go to the certified directory, you will get an actual one-page statement of qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| on that particular city certified in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Now, some of our vendors are certified by other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| CDOT, Governor's Office of Diversity, Women's Business Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| So some of them have several types of certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| This particular directory just serves certified businesses that the city has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Just the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Boyce mentioned our numerical goals, and I see you guys have vetted this pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| so I'll just sort of briefly go through this particular slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| As he stated, he is actually adding an additional reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| He, meaning the purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| adds additional reporting to go along with our annual reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| that is requested of the Equal Business Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| We make sure that each one of our reports that is submitted and placed on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| is separate from small business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| It's recorded separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| And the breakdown is by gender and race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| So you're able to look at it and get through each one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| you can actually look at each category and get the general information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| as it pertains to each business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| Before we go on, Jocelyn, on the certification you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| I'm still puzzling over that, does a business go in and get certified that they qualify as a small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| or a woman-owned business or a minority-owned business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| so that they then get the notices, the phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| whatever contact approaches we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| or that they're shown that they already qualify for the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| What does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| What does the certification do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| The certification component was to basically provide verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| that the individual is actually 51% owned and operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| and the city has actually vetted the business's information and data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| and provide that clarification and verification that that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| that they are 51% owned either by women or by minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| and that in order to get that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| with the city of Knoxville you do not have to be certified to receive business from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| You can fill out a vendor application and get the cold calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| and get the information just as well as these particular individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| With this you actually get our website publicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| If someone's calling trying to get verification of where exactly can I find a listing of certified vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| that would be my first spot to send them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| So a general contractor might go to your certification list to get subs that they could use on a project, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| There's also, as I mentioned, a small group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| It's a referral of business in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| As I mentioned also, there's a small business directory on there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| and those individuals are not certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| They just wanted to have the information submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| The certification directory goes a little bit more in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| You click on their particular business, you'll get a full statement of qualifications on what their references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| and things of that nature, a one-pager for that particular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| It's an option and some businesses just elect not to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| These forms are accessible via our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Or I can mail them either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| How do you verify that certification to make sure that these businesses that are claiming to be minority-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| businesses, how is that verified anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| The certification process consists of several different eight items that they're asked to submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| One is they're asked to actually submit their bylaws, their charters, their organizational chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| Some financials is also requested as well as business licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| And their particular package, that information has to prove that they are the ones that actually can run this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| if one of their employees actually leaves or if something happens to where they are the only one responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3236)|
| 0:54:05| They're going to be the only ones there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| This particular set of documentation is what we ask of them to provide that verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| And we do call or I do call and verify based on what they've submitted, their references as well as their verifiables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3253)|
| 0:54:23| because they give me permission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3263)|
| 0:54:31| No more questions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Our ongoing outreach efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| We have a lengthy ongoing outreach efforts here from the Equal Business Opportunity Program as well as from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| Purchasing Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| And some of them are done in collaborative efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| And some of these are initiated by the EBLP and actually carried out by just the Equal Business Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| And here are just a few of those that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3301)|
| 0:55:18| Boyce mentioned our city business opportunity event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| He actually undercounted how many times we've done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| We've actually been doing this almost for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| We initiated this back in 2007, had some great sponsors, and still continue to have good turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| We've been at it for a long time, right, Boyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Annual reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| This annual report that I am referring to here is part of the executive order for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| When the office was established, it was stated that this particular office would submit an annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| Now, this is what we put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| What Boyce is putting out is an addition to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| So you're getting additional information and you're getting it more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| So that keeps us abreast of where we are and engaging us how we're going to look at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| You can actually access an abridged version of the EBLP report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| which is basically the city information that Boyce puts out and an overview of some of the things that we do from the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| You should be able to access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| And actually, you should be able to go there now and view the one we had, our report from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| In the report, the actual manual full report, you actually have KUB, KCDC, and CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| and airport information listed as well, how well they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| and just getting an idea of different types of things that they're doing to make things happen in their world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| Technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| That was another component of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| And in our technical assistance program, some of you may have attended some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Some of you may have heard of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| What we do is some serious outreach through purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| and making sure people are aware of our technical assistance workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| And here are some of the topics that we've covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3426)|
| 0:57:14| As presenters, we've had some tremendous presenters abroad that reached a broad audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| We had the former mayor of Augusta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| We've had HUD's small business acting director for the small business utilization program here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3442)|
| 0:57:31| We did well with attracting individuals to this small business conference that we usually hold in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| This is different than what we do, I'm sorry, that we hold in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| This is different than what we do in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| This provides the technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| It directs resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| It provides free bidding and estimating ideals and concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| an opportunity to actually come before and listen to and access a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3472)|
| 0:58:01| We've also been able to live stream some of our actual technical assistance via web| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| through the Pellissippi State on Magnolia Campus efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| They've helped us live stream some of these particular workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| We do have a mentor-protege program as part of one of our technical assistance pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| It was established in 2000, and the first session began in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| They completed it in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| As far as the three, they were actually from the construction field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| Three mentors were from the construction field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| meaning three protégés, two were general contractors, and one was an electrician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| After reviewing our mentor-protege program, we came to the conclusion that we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| to provide a more intimate one-on-one to allow them to be able to actually open their books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| and be as vulnerable as possible, and SCORE has been able to provide them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| an array of technical assistance to our incoming protégés.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| Accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| I only listed a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| There are several small ones, but here are some of the larger ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| or the primary ones that I wanted to put up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| We established a goal setting with TDOT on TDOT projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| We do that as TDOT projects are assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| Let me hold you up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Mr. DellaVoppa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Jocelyn, I was wondering, do you work with the chamber at all that they have some kind of a mentoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| of small businesses, and I didn't know if they went out and worked with minority contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| through your suggestion or otherwise to help them get ready to get the contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| to succeed in bidding, to be picked as the subcontractor of a general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| I mean, is there some cross-pollination through the chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| When the chamber first began their program there, they came to the city and sat down with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| and actually visited with us on a couple of our Equal Business Opportunity Program meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| and pulled our model, so to speak, to derive what they have put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| And, yes, definitely we have talked about, as our protégés leave our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| that they would be actually guided toward the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| because at that point they've already had opportunity to get the technical piece under wraps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| and their weaknesses strengthened and be in a better position to be able to be served by the mentors from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| You're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Another thing is one of the accomplishments were that on our Form 1 and Form 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| that third bullet is referring to the actual language that I mentioned at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| It is referring to making sure that the individual contractors are submitting this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| and we're going back and doing heightened monitoring and our evaluation of what they're actually submitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| And most of you are aware of the East Knoxville Professional Business Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| that they're up and running and their momentum, they have great momentum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| and they are steadily progressing right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| That was an initiation with the city of Knoxville and facilitated actually from our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| and collaboration with a couple of other, with the Urban League, SunTrust Bank and the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| And these are our basic focal points for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| There are several more, but here are some of the ones that we feel that would be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| in assisting the purchasing department and pushing us closer to our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| One of the focal points that I did not place up there is that sometimes on a request basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3705)|
| 1:01:53| and sometimes I initiate these particular projects when funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| We work with PBA on the CAT projects, and we have specific breakfasts and receptions in order to attract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| to call in minority and women-owned business on this specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| To actually discuss all the ins and outs of that particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| and they have a special invitation and announcement, and they're asked to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| So we can do it project-specific as well if we get the cooperation from the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| And PBA has been great with working with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| So we did two for the CAT project, and we assisted with the lead information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| We provided a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| And in conclusion, since the creation of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| we've established a professional relationship across the state with various managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| and programs similar to ours in an effort to draw their best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| from their best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Knoxville does have the oldest program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Nonetheless, we definitely have the best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| The Equal Business Opportunity Program has become extremely visible over the past five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| and certainly hope that we can become more effective just as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| Thank you, Ms. Hundley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I wondered, Jocelyn, if you have looked into that Nashville software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| whatever they're doing, to find out how they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| Jocelyn, if you have looked into that Nashville software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| whatever they're doing to find out how they're doing that contractor alerts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| when there are bids that fit their, you know, their job type or skill set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| So if you're an architect, you get the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| or if you're a building contractor, you get the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Have you looked into that piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| That would be a purchasing piece, and I haven't looked into making that particular piece happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| but I've talked with the Small Business Development Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Business Office of Assistance Manager, on how well it operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| and how well it helps them to notify their small business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| I could actually defer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| Purchasing, because they're working with our IS department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| and we have an iSupplier model that we're developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| and it's going to do some of those similar things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| I'm not exactly sure exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| It's going to do that exact thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| It is called iSupplier, Jocelyn's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| and it should be effective sometime this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| hopefully earlier in the summer rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| I'd like to be able to go to that business breakfast sometime in early June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| and say this is out there now, so this summer, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| that we'll be able to do the same thing they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| All right, and from your perspective, Jocelyn, if I could ask another question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| what do you see the reluctance from the minority community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| or the women-owned business community to be more, you know, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| aggressive in going after bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Is there something we're doing wrong that's holding folks back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| I mean, is there a perception that why bother, you're not going to get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| I mean, what are you seeing out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Well, I'm relying upon several different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| and I'm speculating as much as Boise is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| I'm listening to the Equal Business Opportunity Program Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| and our whole thing is that's what that RFP is going to try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3906)|

| 1:05:11| What are we not doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Look at us internally, look at us externally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| Is it because our bonding is too high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Is it because our insurance is different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| What is it that is keeping you from actually following through with the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| Is the technical assistance missing your mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| What exactly is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| I mean, for one example, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| do we have too much annoying paperwork so that you'd rather do business somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| I mean, is there something that you're seeing that holds people back from going after the jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| For those who actually go through the process and bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| we have several testimonials that actually have presented at some of our workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| It goes just like I can just refer to what Boise was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| One will say there's too much trouble, you've already got a set of contractors in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| while the others say, you know, I came to this business breakfast and I stuck with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| I was consistent, and now I've got a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| So it's a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| It's all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Well, we had heard someone say one time that Oak Ridge has set-asides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| and it's easier to get a contract as a minority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| and so why bother with the city when you can go there and get a set-aside contract or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| I'm just curious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Well, my experience in speaking with the Small Business Development Office program managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| and with the Department of Energy program managers, I asked them the same question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| and they responded with, well, most of them are not even local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Most of the people that get the contracts are not local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| They're more regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| So they were unable to give me numbers, but that was their speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Any other questions for Ms. Hunley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| Seeing none, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Now I'm going to call upon Zimbabwe Matuhu on behalf of the Black Business Contractors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4017)|
| 1:07:11| Zimbabwe Matawo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| Black Business Contractors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| 1528 McCollough Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| This is Groundhog Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| I expected to see a woodchuck run from under the dais there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4049)|
| 1:07:37| because it seems to me that instead of this being February 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4057)|
| 1:07:45| I'm listening to a presentation that we heard time and time again in the early 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4065)|
| 1:07:59| The victim again is being blamed for a lack of public expenditures going to the disenfranchised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4079)|
| 1:08:11| primarily African-American firms, other minorities, and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| Blaming the victim is the easiest scapegoat going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4098)|
| 1:08:28| The Black Business Contractors Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| and I hope indeed you did get the information that I left for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| Did you indeed get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Could you pull the mic closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| With that information, I hope you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| He's older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| You've got to talk loud for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| With that information, I hope you are at least familiar somewhat with our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Nashville was looked at and applauded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| but Nashville did not initiate this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| this extraordinary effort toward including the excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| It started right here in Knox County by the Black Business Contractors Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| and that virus spread from here to Nashville via our effort on to Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4154)|
| 1:09:22| The first effort to establish a disparity study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| and a Title VI office started here in Knox County with the Black Business Contractors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| It moved west to Nashville and Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| You applaud Nashville, that's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| because they obviously had the energy, the concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| and I guess in some ways the empathy to do what was necessary to bring about some achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4191)|
| 1:09:59| This effort started not with Haslam, but with Victor Ashe and Schumper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4199)|
| 1:10:14| I intended to speak to and disagree with an earlier position taken by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4214)|
| 1:10:26| it seemed, the Purchasing Department and the Title VI office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| that was reflected in their earlier news release stating that things were going along pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4233)|
| 1:10:42| as it pertained to expenditures to African American and other minority firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| But I then learned from the release of the RFP that they had finally acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| how devastating this process had been to African American firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4257)|
| 1:11:09| So as a consequence, I don't have to convince you that the condition is desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| They have acknowledged that. It is a desperate condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| Businesses are disappearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| And we must take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| The action plan does not have to be developed. It is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| The city of Knoxville paid for a disparity study that has clearly outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| and depicted procedures that can be taken in order to resolve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4306)|
| 1:11:55| Our position is that the RFP went out prematurely if it was to go out at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4315)|
| 1:12:09| That the RFP probably was in reaction to us finally getting a hearing here before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4329)|
| 1:12:23| With that in mind, we know in fact that in order to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4343)|
| 1:12:37| the most recent data has to be acquired as it pertained to the targeted groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4357)|
| 1:12:46| There certainly should be a provision in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| We need to look at, after 11 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| how much change has taken place as it pertains to women businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| African American businesses, and other minority groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| Consequently, we're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4393)|
| 1:13:29| withdraw and amend the minority-owned business assistance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| Withdraw and amend the minority-owned business assistance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| so as not to request for a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| That's the proposal. The RFP is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Specific information contained in the disparity study needs updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| Document the current number of minority and female businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| The current number of minority and female businesses and any increase, decrease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| decrease in number respectively since the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| Two, reconfigure the Title VI office, that is the Equal Business Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4452)|
| 1:14:22| And three, charge the Black Business Contractors Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4462)|
| 1:14:31| Zimbabwe as its president, and the City of Knoxville Office of Purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| Oris Evans as director, with submitting for approval to Mayor Daniel T. Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| and the Knoxville City Council, a revised policy and goals for the minority contracting program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4485)|
| 1:14:56| that incorporates both race-neutral and race-conscious recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| This charge shall be submitted no longer than 30 days after it's assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| Let me reiterate, with utmost emphasis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| it is almost redundant, in many instances superfluous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| to have a consultant come in and repeat the thorough job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| that has already been paid for in the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| What we need is already contained and is sitting on some desk in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4535)|
| 1:15:46| We need to distill, I believe, what is asked for in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| However, I concede and I recommend that before that is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| that Boris and I get together and proceed as reflected in these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4560)|
| 1:16:09| I concede also that in order for us to proceed with some muscularity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| to give parity to women, African-American, other minority businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| we have to prepare ourselves for any challenge that may come from that good old boy network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4583)|
| 1:16:34| That's why the update is necessary because it has proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| that most challenges, even those that have not been won,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| have been based on what they have charged as being antiquated data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4604)|
| 1:16:53| And the disparity study now is a decade old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| So the RFP, as I see it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| should focus on updating information on women and minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| So as we proceed with sincerity and as we accelerate an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| to recompense those folk who have been excluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| we will be defended properly against any possible challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| that may come from those who have gotten used to the orthodoxy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| An orthodoxy that has left out continuously a significant group in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4653)|
| 1:17:42| Let me share with you these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4670)|
| 1:18:09| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| If there are those who want to sign up for the public forum session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| if you would come down to the desk over here, you could sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| I thought I'd get that in while we were passing those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Zimbabwe, could you tell me, I heard what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| I'm not sure I've digested it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| What do you think that black and minority women, minority contractors are not bidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| are not being selected, are being discouraged from bidding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| I mean, what do you think is happening out there on a practical level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| I mean, I've heard the theoretical argument you made, but on a practical level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| why aren't either more contractors coming forward or we're not picking more contractors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| What do you see happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| I think some elements of all of the above is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| However, I think we're missing the boat by focus on that primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| I think we need to give primacy to, historically, how do we get to the point where folk who have a passion for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4766)|
| 1:19:38| and who've invested time and money into it have given up on trying to benefit from one of the greatest resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4778)|
| 1:19:52| in the city and in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| I think if Pavlo's dog, instead of getting a sugar treat, had gotten a bitter pill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| the mutt would have stopped going to the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| He would have stopped ringing the bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| You're saying people are discouraged from going forward because they haven't gotten contracts in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| I think the reason why certain folk, even today, are reluctant to donate organs is because of the residuals of the Tuskegee Institute experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4818)|
| 1:20:45| I think that tradition leaves an inertia that we cannot ignore and simply discard with spurious arguments of they're not actively pursuing contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4845)|
| 1:21:03| That is too mundane and insensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| It is insensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| It's the reason they're not working is because they don't want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| If they wanted to work, they could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| I cannot overemphasize what is already available to the city of Knoxville that is contained in the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4877)|
| 1:21:30| The disparity study outlines what they call non-racial procedures and what they call racial procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4890)|
| 1:21:43| What that is, you have race-neutral things you can do and you have things that are race-conscious that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| I think that when Quinn and Boris and I get together, we're going to come up with some kind of combination of the two that I hope you guys will accept so we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4911)|
| 1:22:06| Again, I think that it is absolutely redundant to put a lot of time and effort into additional research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| That is not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| We know that we have folks interested in doing business and we know from the presentation that that business is not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4937)|
| 1:22:28| What Title VI does, it says, which is the biggest portion, I think the most dynamic portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4948)|
| 1:22:41| Title VI was supposed to solve this problem and they gave it more potency as the years went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4961)|
| 1:22:52| It's supposed to be not only reactive, it's supposed to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| It emphasizes being proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| Come up with ways to go out and make this happen, to rectify this, to make this part of society whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| Don't just sit back and say, well, they're not coming in and we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| You're supposed to look at it, analyze it, come up with various ways to correct it, and it tells you that the concern no longer will be whether or not your intention is to discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=4996)|
| 1:23:30| They took that off the table, which kept a whole lot of blisters from being formed through argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| It said, we'll just look at the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Just look at the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| After five, six, seven, eight, nine years, look at the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| And if the results still show a disparity, then take proactive measures to correct the disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5026)|
| 1:23:55| Don't waste time saying, we didn't mean to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| We didn't do it intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| That was not a conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| Don't waste time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| What's the result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| The result is after 11 years, you have virtually no business going to African Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5044)|
| 1:24:13| And it's so bad that you look at the business going to women, which is despicable as a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5053)|
| 1:24:23| Let me say this, and I'll take any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| We don't want to be compared with the worst that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| So if you see how bad things are in Nashville or in Memphis or in Johnson City, say, well, we're not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| That's not the horse we're running with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| We're running with secretariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| That's who we're running with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| We're running with secretariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| So don't compare us to the slowest horse in the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| We're running with secretariat, and when you compare and contrast us to secretariat, we're not doing good at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5093)|
| 1:25:02| But we have the capacity in this city and this county to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| Does your association help black contractors submit bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| I mean, does the Black Contracting Association do that, Minority Contracting Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| The association doesn't, but we have members who assist other contractors to submit bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| I'm trying to get to the point of, are we not getting people coming forward with the bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| or are we just too discouraged to come forward with the bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| I don't quite understand what you're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| Mayor Brown has had his light on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| All right, well, I'll cede to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| I was trying to get down to specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| We'll get back to you, Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Zimbabwe, thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And you are saying that you're willing and you're recommending that you would sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5152)|
| 1:25:59| or work with Boss Evans and come up with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| I think if we can do that, if that will come out of this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| I think that would be a very positive thing, in addition to at least one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| Mr. Evans, I'm going to ask, would you be willing to work with Zimbabwe on that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5177)|
| 1:26:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Well, I think that would be very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| I don't know who else to recommend right now, but I think we'd need at least three of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| at least a committee of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| But out of that, that would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| I think we can cut through a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| And I think everyone, we're not opposed to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| We're trying to get a balance and help with the minority businesses, the women-owned businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5209)|
| 1:26:58| and help bring up the standard in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| So from my point of view, I think that's a very good suggestion, and I hope that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| and we will try to make it happen as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Mr. Matavo, help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| Yes, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Now, let me, we have two folks signed up on the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| Do you want to hear from the folks who are signed up for public forum now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Let's go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Mr. Vern Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Quick note, I might follow up on Mayor Brown's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| And, Mr. Evans, if you know of any other representatives from any other small disadvantaged businesses, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| that may be productive in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| I know there's other organizations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| They may not be actively involved in the city, but I'm sure they are with TVA and with Oak Ridge and in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| So I think that might be advantageous because I think there are some things that can be fixed in terms of our recognizing opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5287)|
| 1:28:17| and reaching out and so forth so that if there are opportunities that our businesses within the community can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5297)|
| 1:28:27| And I think that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| So I just would ask you to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Mr. Patterson, if you could give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| My name is Vernon Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| I reside at 922 Stewart Street, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| I have been in Knoxville for approximately 11 years, 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| And I came from a very large metropolitan area just outside of Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| I have worked in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| I've worked in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| And I have always been involved in one component of America, which is Build America, construction, the construction business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| I think that's one of the major components, if not the component we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| And how do we get minorities more involved in helping build America and helping Knox County and the city of Knoxville get more minority participation in the construction industry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5360)|
| 1:29:35| And that question comes up, why are we not getting more minority participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| We have a lot of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| We have processes and procedures and all the things that we feel we should have and need to have in order to make that happen, but it's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5382)|
| 1:29:52| The big question is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| I've always asked myself why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| And I hear from particularly the African-American population of the construction business, it boils down to they feel that it's already a done deal before they bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5399)|
| 1:30:12| They feel that they cannot get bonding in order to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| They feel that there's not a requirement to encourage the major construction companies to even entertain hiring minority subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5418)|
| 1:30:28| Now, what I've always heard and what I see is in a lot of the RFPs and the bids is the word encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| We encourage you contractors who bid to hire minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| Encouragement does not require them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| It just says we encourage you to, we hope you will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| Nine times out of ten, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| They don't have to, so they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| And they may say we tried and we looked, but I don't know where they're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| I've been here 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| And maybe they make a couple of calls, maybe they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| I have found that examples of what the federal government does and what other major metropolitans do is they will have requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5463)|
| 1:31:15| Requirements that if you're going to bid as a major primary contractor, you will have minority participation no matter what or you won't get the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5475)|
| 1:31:25| RFPs, you can simply do that by having them bring in the minorities up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| Name who they're going to have on their team and stick to it and commit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| The word commitment is a much stronger word in my mind than encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| And so when I see RFPs come out, I go through it and it says we encourage and hope that you hire minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5502)|
| 1:31:52| It won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| And then we run into the situation where we just point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| We have minority participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| We have women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Quite frankly, if you look at the percentages of women-owned businesses compared to what we call African-American, 90% or 99% of those businesses are owned by white women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5522)|
| 1:32:14| It is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| A lot of contractors put their wives in business or their best friends or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| There's nothing wrong with that because that's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| When it comes to the minority African-American, the question is why are they not getting the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5544)|
| 1:32:32| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| And I think a lot of it has to do with the discouragement that they have experienced in the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| This disparity study and all that is great, but if you don't implement it and if you don't make it better, then it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5557)|
| 1:32:46| So I recommend, just from a personal side of this and from my experiences, encouragement is not the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| Commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| You ask our major contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| You ask our city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| You ask anyone who has to do with this business of construction to commit up front and bring minorities in that way rather than after they get the bid and you may or may not get any participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5580)|
| 1:33:15| And you also have to help minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| The minority companies are not large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| If they're large, you wouldn't have a disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| You would not have the problems we have, simply put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| Thank you, Mr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| David Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| Yes, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| My name is David Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| I am an electrical contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| Been in business for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| Yes, we have done contracts with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| We've done ongoing contracts right now with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| We've done several jobs here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| We're licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| We're bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| We're insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| Have the highest license that you can attain, so I feel like I'm competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| However, Vernon Patterson said it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| Contractors generally like to contract to subcontractors, and you would consider me as a subcontractor, that they are familiar with, I find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5670)|
| 1:34:46| And if the city of Knoxville does not offer any incentives to those contractors to include minority contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5686)|
| 1:35:00| then it will never change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Thank you, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| Is there any discussion among council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I think what we've heard tonight is that the city has made an ongoing effort to address this issue, but it hasn't been enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5717)|
| 1:35:26| We have a problem in front of us that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| We've heard some productive solutions tonight, which is always encouraging on council to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| rather than just the problem that there's some productive ideas out there for future solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| I'm glad to know that the city issued the RFP for a contractor to help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| That person might be able to bring some new ideas to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| I would encourage that our mayor is taking some leadership in encouraging this meeting to take place with Mr. Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| and Mr. Matavu and a third person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| And I'm hopeful that a report will come back to this body very shortly, that we're going to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5761)|
| 1:36:11| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| I was going to ask Boyce if you could tell us something about this idea of, in at least construction contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5773)|
| 1:36:23| which was what we heard about, some requirement of a percentage participation being part of the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| or being part of the evaluation of the bid so that if I'm a guy that comes in and pledges to have, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5789)|
| 1:36:38| 10%, 15%, 20% minority participation, I get credit points towards my bid that makes it more favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| What are we doing in that regard that kind of gets where the rubber meets the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5806)|
| 1:36:54| We're kind of getting a little bit deep into procurement here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| When you're talking a straight design and then build, in other words, the construction invitation to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5819)|
| 1:37:09| where the design's already done, now you're going out with an invitation to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| it frankly comes down to the bidding entities saying they can do all this, agreeing to what all's in the boilerplate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5833)|
| 1:37:25| having the proper licensing classification, and then the price drives the train by the city code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5845)|
| 1:37:35| But is there something in that price evaluation that says you get price credit for having a commitment of a minority subcontractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| No, sir, not in a straight invitation to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| If it were a request for proposal, like if we hire, let's say we went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| a lot of firms or entities now go to the contractor at risk thing where you hire an entity to handle the whole project, cradle to grave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5875)|
| 1:38:15| i.e., this entity will take the money, he's going to hire an architect, go through his own procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5895)|
| 1:38:22| then he's going to, once that's done, the design's done, he's going to go out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| If you're in an RFP type situation, you can award those points, like I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| for having a sound plan to hire subcontractors and subconsultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5913)|
| 1:38:41| But as far as a financial incentive, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| And if you were to get into any type of financial incentive, such as bid discounting, like we talked about, national, my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5925)|
| 1:38:55| my limited understanding of the law is that it has to be race and gender neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| You can make it apply to small businesses in a certain region, but you can't, it has to be race and gender neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| That's, I mean, Ms. Poplin or others might correct me, but that's my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| You were making a distinction, at least, between an invitation to bid, which is a dollar and cents evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| and an RFP that has more leeway in describing what the surface is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| Affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| The request for proposals process, you get a little more subjectivity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| You've got the evaluation committee looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| and that's one of the things they do consider is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| what's your plan to do business with minority-owned firms or women-owned firms or small businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| I mean, they're looking at all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| But when it's a straight invitation to bid, price kind of drives the train if you've met all the other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5986)|
| 1:39:54| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| We're in a procedural quagmire here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| Do you wish to hear further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| I move we suspend the rules and allow him to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Seeing none, Mr. Mutavu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| The Croson case coming out of Virginia, which established how essential disparities studies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6018)|
| 1:40:31| expressed on an approach that, if we adhere to it, would resolve a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6031)|
| 1:40:41| It makes available as part of the processes for resolving this, those efforts that are race-neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6041)|
| 1:40:55| and those efforts that are not race-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| It says that your first effort should be whether or not you can resolve the problem by using race-neutral efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6060)|
| 1:41:13| processes, procedures, implementations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| If, in fact, after a given amount of years, you examine your progress and you find that you have failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6077)|
| 1:41:27| or you are seriously failing, you then can implement race-conscious processes, procedures, and implementations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6087)|
| 1:41:38| You can present any combination of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| That is the significance of the Croson decision and why it is imperative to proceed your processes with a disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6102)|
| 1:41:54| It's good that we understand that, and that's why it's important that city council buys off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6114)|
| 1:42:01| So if there is a challenge, and I think that there will be few, if any, but if there is a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| you can win the challenge because you have proceeded according to the dictates of the Croson decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| and from the information found in the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| Further discussion among council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| I just wanted to reiterate what Councilman Roddy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| I'm glad we had this workshop, and we did hear a lot of good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| and I'm glad we conducted, convened here around this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| I also appreciate what Mayor Brown has recommended based upon Zimbabwe Mitabu's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6168)|
| 1:42:57| I do want to say that this is an important issue and dynamic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| and I appreciate what Mr. Patterson commented in a very kind way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6183)|
| 1:43:11| If someone locks you out of the house, your problem is not with the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| and we're like fiddling around with numbers and the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| I think that's important, but somehow we have perhaps an attitude in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6197)|
| 1:43:23| that based upon the fact that we only feel comfortable with people we feel comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| we're not meeting each other and getting to know each other in all the different corners of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6208)|
| 1:43:36| And while this might not seem fair, there is a long-term impact of how we raise our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| and what our children are looking at in terms of their aspiration, in terms of the fields that they want to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| It also, if our business, if we can't figure out a way that the business community will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6231)|
| 1:44:01| will work with minority contractors and do it in a way that it also pleases them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| because I think that they don't realize the kind of talent that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| I know several minority business owners who are doing quite well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| but they're doing quite well getting business somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| I mean, they're here, but they're doing business elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| and it's just somehow that the relationship hasn't been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| And I hear we're making really good efforts, and I applaud our efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| but I guess I just want to say that I'm glad we convened this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| It is an issue, and it's not just a small issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| It's a big issue, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| And who knows, there might be somebody in this room who's running for mayor who might want to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Further comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Seeing none, thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| You are invited to remain for the special called meeting, which is scheduled to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Let me ask council's pleasure with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| Do you want to take a five-minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| or do you just want to go straight ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| I see a no to the five-minute break, and I see a yes to the five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| Everyone who would favor a five-minute break, raise your hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| Everyone who would prefer not to, please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| We're going to take a five-minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| and be back here at 651 promptly to start the special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6325)|
| 1:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6356)|

| 1:55:17| It now remains that we have gathered here this afternoon to talk about decades, decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| since the generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| going to turn this over to, well, let's call the roll again. We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6925)|
| 1:55:33| Councilman Bailey. Here. Mayor Brown. Here. Councilman Dela Volpe. Here. Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| Here. Councilman Palmer. Here. Councilman Pablis. Here. Councilman Roddy. Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| Thomas. Here. Councilman Woodhull. Here. All right, we're all present and accounted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| and we'll turn this meeting over now to Mr. Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| Thank you, Mr. Mayor. As you all know, we've been working together over the last few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6954)|
| 1:56:01| to try to put together a set of rules or a set of procedures that we would follow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6961)|
| 1:56:07| the purpose of accomplishing the election of a vice mayor. And I think we have reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| a set of rules that will work for you. But if you will listen, I would like to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| those and then if you want to make any changes to those, then we can do that. But assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| that you want to go with what we've talked about so far, it would include the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| First, council would have an opportunity to discuss the qualifications of the vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| if you want to do that. The next thing that would happen is the city recorder would call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| the roll of the members of council. She would seek a response to the question, are you willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| to be considered for the position of vice mayor? When called upon, each council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| would respond with either yes or no in response to that question. After those council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| who have expressed a willingness to be considered for the vice mayor's position have been identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| then each such member would be permitted to make a statement. There would be council discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| and questions permitted during that period after the council member would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| to make a statement and then you could follow up with discussion related to that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| Following the statements of the council members willing to be considered and any related council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| discussion, then you would start the voting process. The first round of voting would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| conducted by the city recorder calling the roll of council with each member responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| by stating the name of the person for whom that council member wishes to vote. If any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| council member receives five votes, that member would be elected as vice mayor. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| no member receives five votes in the first round of voting, then you would proceed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| the next round of voting. I think that what we've talked about is after five rounds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| voting, if no member has been selected as the vice mayor, you all will discuss a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7073)|
| 1:57:59| or adopting a process whereby the person or persons receiving the lowest number of votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| would be eliminated from consideration in the next round. Voting would then be concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| when an applicant has five or more votes at the conclusion of any round of voting. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| there any questions about that? Would you like to discuss any other changes to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7095)|
| 1:58:22| Ms. Palmer, is that? I can't tell you why that is. Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| I'd like to make the motion to adopt these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| This would be a motion to suspend the rules and adopt these in lieu of Robert's rules of order for the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| of accomplishing the election of a vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7118)|
| 1:58:43| All right. It's been moved and properly seconded. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| Any opposers? Ayes have it and so are it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| Mr. Mitchell, are you ready to call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| Actually, we need to determine whether council wants to discuss the qualifications of a vice mayor before we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7139)|
| 1:59:08| Is there any discussion relative to the qualifications you're looking for in a vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| You all are familiar with how a vice mayor operates and that the vice mayor serves, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| as the chief administrative officer of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7159)|
| 1:59:25| Does anyone want to have a discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| I couldn't see your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| Thank you, Mayor and Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| This body, during the time that I have served on city council, has had two excellent vice mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7175)|
| 1:59:43| And I've been thinking about the qualities that they brought to this body that made them good leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7183)|
| 1:59:52| And you're trying to lead a body of leaders, which in and of itself can be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| You talk about too many chiefs and not enough Indians sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| And so I think in that vein, this body has worked well with a servant leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| who sees him or herself as a consensus builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| and someone who very much values shared leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| Again, all nine of us were equally elected to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| and I think we work the best and the most effectively when we work as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| And sometimes that means dividing up leadership responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| and knowing that, for example, in the past, Mayor Brown has covered issues relating to Knoxville Area Transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7235)|
| 2:00:42| and has been able to report back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| because realistically, all of us can't be everywhere all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| I think also we know that in these chambers we have occasions when we face really difficult, wrenching decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7250)|
| 2:00:58| And we're not always going to end up on the same side of those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| and we're certainly not always going to be able to satisfy everyone that comes to petition us in these chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7263)|
| 2:01:10| And I think it's critically important that the Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| is a leader in exercises in trust building and relationship building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| I know when I first came on council seven years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| we added the opportunity to share a meal together once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| And I think those of us that have been in this group for that amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| feel like that exercise has reaped some dividends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| that there's an opportunity to visit informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| It's certainly sunshine, so we operate within the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| And we don't deliberate about matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| We just talk about the weather and our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| But it gives us an opportunity to share one another's lives in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| that when we come around the table and an issue has a potential to be incredibly divisive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| at the end of the day we can debate fairly and debate civilly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| and then go home and still be able to convene again as a respectful body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| So, in a nutshell, those are the values that I think are important that this person bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7330)|
| 2:02:19| Mr. Bailey and then Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| And I appreciate Councilman Roddy's remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| but I guess there's three responsibilities, primary responsibilities that the Vice Mayor has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| And one is to represent the council and to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| And so they've got to be willing to take the time to understand the will of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| and to represent that to the administration and to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| Secondly, I think that they need to understand the city recorder's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7370)|
| 2:02:58| and to be willing to be courteous and respectful of their responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| And then again, I guess, and that's really important to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| because I respect the ladies in the city recorder's office and they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| So, and then I guess lastly, the Vice Mayor needs to be prepared to represent the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7396)|
| 2:03:24| in the absence of the mayor and that city functions when the mayor even is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| So, that's traditionally been the responsibilities and I think highly of all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| and I look forward to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| I agree with both Councilwoman Roddy and Councilman Bailey's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| I'd like to stress that I would hope that the Vice Mayor will represent the will of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| and as Councilman Roddy pointed out, by obtaining consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| and I know that we are sunshined on what we do all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| but I also think that listening is a really key skill for the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| who's going to be our Vice Mayor to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| So, I agree with both Councilman Roddy and Councilman Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| probably Councilman de la Vaughn but I can't read his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| Councilman de la Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| I just had sort of a question and or suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| I'm wondering about the duration of this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| We're going to have four new city council people come end of next December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| and I wonder whether we have to take a second look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| I don't know whether this is for the term until we get a new body here or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| but that would make a lot of sense to me that we at least look again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| after we have the full council sitting that's been reconstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| Absent something extraordinary happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| this would be the remainder of the term which would be until December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| I believe it is, we would have an election of a new Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| after we elect a new Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| Satisfies my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| Thank you for that, Councilman de la Vaughn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| because I think especially for the public who may be watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| that's a good question to ask how long the term will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7508)|
| 2:05:15| I don't see any further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| I guess, Ms. Mitchell, we're ready to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| This would be in response to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| are you willing to be considered for the position of Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Councilman de la Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| Councilman Bailey and Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| Pavlis, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7555)|
| 2:06:02| I guess, Ms. Mitchell, we can call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| Can we start with Councilmember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| They have an opportunity to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Let's start with Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7573)|
| 2:06:19| Well, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| You can make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| I look at this as I'm willing to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| and I just think it's an extension of my service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| and I would be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| Well, I would just like to say that I think it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| to bring experience to the position of Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| as I begin my tenth year of service as a councilperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| I've been elected twice in an at-large position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| and once, you know, out of a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| And so, you know, I feel like that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| obviously if you've been elected three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| that, you know, the will of the people has spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| and they trust me in this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| and I think that that's a huge task to earn that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| So I think that that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Continuity, as alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| I mean, obviously we have a new mayor in position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| and I would, however that mayor would want to utilize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| you know, the Vice Mayor or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| I would be willing to do whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| as much as possible to help or as little as possible to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| depending on the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| But obviously there are times when the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| does have to be out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| and for whatever reasons that I would be happy to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| Hopefully you all have seen my ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7659)|
| 2:07:46| to run a meeting as chair of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| I think it's very important that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| that that person deals with a level hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| is courteous to the people that come visit us in our chambers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| because a lot of times it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| it's very difficult for folks to come and be on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| and be in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| So I hope I've exhibited that I'm, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| that I can do that, that I can run a meeting efficiently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| because there may be times, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| when I have to do, when that person would have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| So, in closing, I don't want to be real long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| but, you know, I think experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| really counts in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| I hope that you know I'm a hard worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| I do whatever it takes in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| and throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| you know, to work hard when I hold this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| I have the business experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| I understand what it takes to run a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| in a business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| I've had that experience for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| And just most of all to work with the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| that work in the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| to make it work with efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| and that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| the citizens of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| serve well out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| and to make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| just to make the folks of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| proud of the city council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| So that's what I bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| I'd like to make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| I'm not running for the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| but I'd like to make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| that both of these two councilmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| it's going to be a hard choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| but I would look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| to working with either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| That's the statement I'm trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7772)|

| 2:10:14| Five-four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| One round?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| I think we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| Would you give the results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| Five votes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| Mr. Bailey and four votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| for Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| Mr. Bailey would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| Yes, Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| I move that we elect Mr. Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| One more round of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| Let's have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| I guess we need to take a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7852)|

| 2:10:56| It's been recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| Ms. Mitchell, if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| call the roll again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| Just by affirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| Now we need to elect a CAT representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| I'm going to turn this over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| The transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| authority representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| Before we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| Mr. Bailey, did you have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| statement you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Mayor, I'd just like to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| and I look forward to working with all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| and the city and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| and we've got a lot of good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| ahead of us, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| I'm going to turn this over to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| We really have not talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| about how to do this, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| unless we decide to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| otherwise, you could use Robert's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| rules of order in order to accomplish this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| and that would be simply someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| making a motion that someone be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| nominated. What has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| more often historically than anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| is the presiding officer asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| if anyone is interested in filling that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| we have rarely had more than one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| raise their hand to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| to do that, but if we do have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| than one person, then we can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| how to conduct that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| Is anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| interested in serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| on the CAT board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| No one is interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110203?start=7949)|
