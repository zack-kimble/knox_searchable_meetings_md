| 2:02:01| of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7321)|

| 2:03:07| Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| we don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7389)|

| 2:03:11| we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| I've hesitated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| to do that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| I want everyone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| throw their ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| out, and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| know, I wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| you know, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| Lumpy to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| what he said, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| that's why I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| what I said about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| the 10 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| we can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| whether the 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| percent is too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| high or too low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| or hard to reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| and that's why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| numbers that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| have across here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| and then I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| you have an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| that we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| about a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| and see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| anyone else has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| and then I'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| glad to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| motion, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Well, a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| reasons why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| suggested the 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| percent of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| who have voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| the gubernatorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| One, I felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| it was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| compromise between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| the lower numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| and the higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| numbers that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| were hearing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| both sides, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| secondly, we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| the gubernatorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| election as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| signatures required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| if a group wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| gubernatorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| So, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| that's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| It's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| compromise if a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| group wishes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| change our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| charter, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| that's the basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| that they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| we should try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| be using a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| standard way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| trying to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| with numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| And if we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| to have it in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| charter, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| can always refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| back to it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| And I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| problem with using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| because of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| takes six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| a charter, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| one-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| It takes six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| years to purge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7482)|

| 2:04:53| passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| I just think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| need to use a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| number based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| what a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7498)|

| 2:05:00| vote, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| when they vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| They normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| show up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7503)|

| 2:05:06| election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| And I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| willing to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| number that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| already used in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| the gubernatorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7511)|

| 2:05:14| of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| And I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| And that's why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| picked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| And I still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| that that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| standard that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| high but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7525)|

| 2:05:50| how that speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| to making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7551)|

| 2:05:58| election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| number that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| speaks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| easy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| therefore it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| happen all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| The city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7572)|

| 2:06:14| 30% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| voted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| if you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7579)|

| 2:06:27| that race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| 30% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| fairly easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7594)|

| 2:06:41| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| It's way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=7602)|

| 2:17:39| That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| because both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8260)|

| 2:17:48| school boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8268)|

| 2:17:52| I can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8272)|
| 2:17:53| most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8273)|

| 2:25:24| it comes back to that particular race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8724)|
| 2:25:30| To me, the most equitable solution would be a percentage, in my opinion, 51% of the votes cast for that particular spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8730)|

| 2:26:06| Looking at these figures here, if you will ever want to look at it, this 15% of the gubernatorial race here, I had more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8766)|
| 2:26:14| I got 60-some percent of the vote, and it would only take 1,626 people to recall me if I was running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8774)|
| 2:26:23| Well, there was more people than that voted against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| So that would be very easy for them to get 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| And I'm sure if everybody else looks at it, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| I got 60-some percent, but yet there were more than 1,600 people voted against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| So there's, I think there was 1,900 and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| So, you know, there's 1,900 people out there that doesn't like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| So, I mean, we don't need to make it too easy, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| And if you look at your figures, probably that many is probably less than what voted against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| Mr. Law Director, regardless of what we do here today, we have to have a public hearing on this, do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| This would require a two-thirds vote of the commission, two public hearings, then ultimately it would go before the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| So whatever number we have here today, it's going to go before the voters for them to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| and give their thought process before we can go on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| So anyway, I just want to make sure we're all aware of the fact that we do have to have public hearings on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| and the public will get an opportunity to give us their thoughts on regardless of what number we come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:31| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| I'm just going to say one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| If you make it too easy, and I understand we have situations out there today, and, of course, you know, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:44| I see what, two people out here, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| I see a couple of people that are interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| If we make it too easy, we will have found a permanent solution to a very temporary problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8870)|
| 2:28:00| Whatever is going on with these two office holders, whatever these two office holders has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:10| if we change the rules so that they will be easier to get rid of, then we not only change the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:19| we change the political dynamics to where, for lack of a better word, a political nuclear option is easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:31| When we originally negotiated this, the recall amendment, the original one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:38| it was done to put safeties on the political nuclear option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| If we remove those safeties, then this will have far-reaching, unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8924)|
| 2:28:51| long after those of us who are sitting here have left office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| And, you know, it's funny that people keep bringing up the situation in the city and saying, well, it's okay for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8935)|
| 2:29:02| It's okay for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| It's okay for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| The city is an entirely different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| We had a city council race and very few people even realized that there was a race going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| The county is different from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| And if you lower the threshold in Knox County, this will happen all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| You will be leaving a political nuclear option without a safety out there for anybody to use at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:32| whether they're mad over a tax increase, whether they're mad over guns in parks, or whether they're mad over a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| If we make it too easy, then we are going to further destabilize Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8979)|
| 2:29:45| And incidentally, Knox County has gone on for a good long time without a recall provision at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:52| At the last election, the people voted in a recall provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:58| And now, immediately before the next election cycle, now we're in this big rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:06| My God, we have to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| And we may change it from something that is far, far worse than any of us can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9008)|
| 2:30:14| So I just want to urge people to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| Don't think about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Don't think about these two office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| Think about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:26| Well, Dave, I'm thinking about the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| And, you know, 15 percent of gubernatorial voters in District 2 was 1568, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9029)|
| 2:30:37| and 50 percent of the votes cast for that office would be 1685.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:43| So it's a difference of like 100 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| So that's pretty close to the 50 percent mark right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| I don't have a problem with the 50 percent of votes cast in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| People are preferring that we base the number on how many people voted in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| I'm fine with the 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| I think that that's a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| So, like I said, let's do something and then move on because we've got to do this again next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| and we have to have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| And really, I think we need to have the public hearings before we start deciding what percentage we're going to put on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:16| and hear what the voters have to say and base our decision on their input instead of what we think is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9076)|
| 2:31:23| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| The far-reaching unintended consequence would be trusting the voters, as Commissioner Wright mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9088)|
| 2:31:35| Ten percent of the registered voters yields a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| Fifteen percent of the gubernatorial yields a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| As Commissioners Brown and Pinkston have pointed out, if you want to do it based on actual turnout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| and 50 percent of that, which was Commissioner Briggs' original proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| that also yields a reasonable number and makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| I'm happy with any one of these because they're all a threshold below where we have all now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:58| and they present a defined figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| So, let's go for one of those three options because any one of those three options makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:06| And then hold a second vote in the public hearing and all the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| Let's trust the voters not only to judge this issue, but trust the voters overall when it comes to recalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:17| And a standard of 50 percent who voted in that particular office being recalled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| which was the original proposal, seems to have enough here that I hope we'll go for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| But any one of those three, that one, the 10 percent of registered voters, 15 percent gubernatorial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9147)|
| 2:32:33| all are in the same range and all are reasonable choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| But it takes you 51 percent to get elected, so you ought to have to be 51 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| But I see the idea, Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| Commissioner Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| So, we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| We have a motion, which was the 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| And then we have a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Twenty-five percent of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| We have a substitute motion of 15 percent of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| And if we have no more lights, we're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| Now, what you have to remember is that since it's a charter change, it takes two-thirds vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9191)|
| 2:33:17| which would take 13 yes votes for it to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| The question, let me back up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| And let me ask my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| As Dr. Harmon has said, we've really got three things before us, and we have public hearings to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9206)|
| 2:33:35| How do we craft what we're doing this evening to be first reading to then have a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:43| or are we really going to have a first reading again next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| Depending on what, if there is a substantial change from the first to second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9227)|
| 2:33:54| then we would actually be going back to a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| I think we need to have some type of number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| This is just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| I think we need to have some type of number tonight so that when we go out there, we have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| That when we come back, then we can debate this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:17| And if it's, if we come up with a number that's not a substantial change, then we're on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:24| If it is a substantial change, then we would be back at a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| But we're still not talking, we still have plenty of time because this won't even go on the ballot until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9268)|
| 2:34:37| So we do have time on our side right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9277)|
| 2:34:42| Does that answer everybody's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| Does anybody have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| Well, we don't have any lights and I don't have a second to your call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| so we're going to go to the votes, to the voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| We're going to do a roll call vote starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9296)|
| 2:35:01| Clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| And this is on the substitute motion, which is 15% of the gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:11| Is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| This is, you're voting on the substitute motion, which is 15% of the gubernatorial election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9314)|
| 2:35:21| would be the threshold of this number of signatures required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| Is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| We're going to roll call starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| Commissioner Strickland votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Commissioner Mark Harmon votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9343)|

| 2:36:42| You vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9403)|
| 2:36:50| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| I didn't want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9412)|
| 2:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| The vote fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| Nine-nine and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| So we're now on the original motion, which is 25 percent of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:14| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| Since we don't have a substitute motion on the floor, are we permitted to make a substitute motion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| We can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:24| And I'm doing this because a lot of these numbers get to be very close, but there seems to be a little bit more consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9444)|
| 2:37:30| for this, and the numbers are a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| I was going to make a motion that we make it 51 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| Fifty-one percent of the votes cast for that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| I'm just trying to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9464)|
| 2:37:45| I'm going to vote for anything that comes by, I'll tell you, because I want to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| But I'm trying to find something from what I've heard that people will vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| Well, Commissioner Lambert, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| I'm going to allow you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| When you make a substitute motion, doesn't it have to be significantly different from the previous substitute motion that failed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:08| These numbers are so close, I would argue that there's very little difference between Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| Broyles' proposal and Mr. Briggs' proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| The numbers are so close, I would challenge that he's essentially asking to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| And since he was not on the prevailing side, I would think that he would not have that option open to him, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| Well, can I change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9509)|
| 2:38:30| I'll change it to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| Commissioner Lambert, I'm going to ask the law director his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| Well, the substitute motion is this, that, and just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| And if it doesn't mirror precisely the other motion, then it's within the province of the commission to proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9521)|
| 2:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| I'm going to rule that he can make that as a proper substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| I just have a problem with basing this on the election of that particular office because if you take a look at, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9536)|
| 2:39:06| if you go to the trustee's office, you had 18,000 votes cast in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9546)|
| 2:39:15| On the same day, the sheriff, you had 24,000 votes cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| The county clerk, you had 17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9559)|
| 2:39:24| And you have different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| You have the different numbers primarily depending on whether it's a contested race or an uncontested race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| And that's why I don't think basing it on how many votes it took to put someone in that office is as good as having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:38| standard such as gubernatorial or some other election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| But I will go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9583)|
| 2:39:44| I'll withdraw just to save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:45| I'll withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| Oh, please don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| I was going to put instead the 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| That's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| Because the 10% is a higher number, and this may satisfy some of the people that are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| And it's a higher number, but it's not an unreasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| Ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9601)|
| 2:40:02| Ten percent of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| And that's the top line on the one that Mr. McKay prepared for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| And all of those standards are higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| And that addresses, and I really understand what Commissioner McKenzie brought up before, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| where there was just, you know, for 10% of the gubernatorial votes, it was 810 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:23| And this moves up to 2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| To be honest, I don't remember having that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| I wasn't at the last Senate government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| I brought that up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| Before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| Yeah, that was brought up in the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| In my absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| You know, if there was a low turnout race, it's that we were afraid of losing you, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| Well, you know, I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| I'm willing to move this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| Have you made a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| I'll make a motion to approve 10% of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9650)|
| 2:40:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| Yeah, that's two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:02| That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| That is now a new substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| And I have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| Well, if you wish to speak on his 10%, because we're getting ready to vote on it here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| Well, here again, we're getting back to the registered voters, which we've talked about time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| is a fictitious number, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| And when you're voting to recall a person, you're not recalling the office, you're recalling that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9680)|
| 2:41:27| The ones that voted for him should have the opportunity to get him out or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9687)|
| 2:41:33| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| If you would like to make a suggestion on something we can pass, I'll be delighted to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| How about trying the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9699)|
| 2:41:40| Yeah, how about trying Craig's motion that we went back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9700)|
| 2:41:45| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| Are you withdrawing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| Well, what I was concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| I have to know where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| I think Craig's will pass, and I think it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| It's not what I want, but it's something that I'll reluctantly live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9715)|
| 2:42:03| Yours is at 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| Mine's 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| The motion I made was 25% of the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9726)|
| 2:42:13| And that is the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| If we have any substitute motions, we have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| Commissioner Briggs, you made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| Yeah, there's one on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| You made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| I'm happy with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| Withdraw it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| Withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9748)|

| 2:42:32| I'll withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| I've got a substitute motion, 21.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| Hey, J.J., how you doing, buddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| Well, I am not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| I will reintroduce that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9765)|
| 2:42:46| Let's hold on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| Commissioner Harmon, you make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| State your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:49| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| Substitute motion that we set the figure at 10% of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9775)|
| 2:42:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| Is there any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| And that one is again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| Ten percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| Can we do some numerical comparison between that offering and 25% of gubernatorial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9792)|
| 2:43:20| Because I don't have numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| I don't have numbers in front of me for 25% of gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| I've got them all out of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9806)|
| 2:43:27| If you want to, if you add the two bottom lines together and Brad's already done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| so he can give you those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| Basically, you're talking about the difference between 10% of registered voters countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| according to this chart, would be about 26,000 to 30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| Is this like just add the two bottom lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| Which, in my opinion, is not a big difference in number of signatures countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9825)|
| 2:43:52| I just think it's best to base it on a better standard, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9832)|
| 2:43:58| which is gubernatorial election versus the registered voters because of the problem they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9838)|
| 2:44:06| and purging bad names that should not even be on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| Hey, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| Countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| Countywide at 10% of registered voters is 26,390.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| 25% of the gubernatorial votes would be 30,000, 621.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| It's a total difference of 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:25| 4,300 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| Signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| Commissioner Lutho, you're putting a standard all over the county, too, instead of each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| It's the same standard that we use all across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| It's also the same standard we're using in other provisions in the charter to use the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| But any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| You understand it's not the same number in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| It's not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| Each district would vary depending on the number of voters that voted in that district in that race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9893)|
| 2:45:01| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:03| If you use those rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9903)|
| 2:45:04| We understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| If you use that as the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| Now, the substitute motion is 10% of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:15| We'll start in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=9915)|

| 2:51:46| Sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| And I just wanted to bring some pictures before county commission tonight where we could actually see what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10307)|

| 2:52:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10326)|

| 2:52:22| and that there's no runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10342)|

| 2:52:45| The next picture shows you another shot of it on that same particular situation on the same day where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10365)|
| 2:52:53| evidently this is acceptable standards to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| At least it's what's been the testimony to date is what is acceptable in Knox County's behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10375)|
| 2:53:01| that there's no violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| Here's some more pictures of the same instance on the same particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10384)|
| 2:53:10| If you'll look in this picture, if you'll look off to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| we have clear water coming in from the left-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| and we have dirty water coming in from the, quote, construction side of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| But evidently nothing's really happening, and there's no sediment in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| and there's really no problems as it relates to Ms. Cole's property based upon testimony that's been brought before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10403)|
| 2:53:30| And so I just wanted to bring in some independent pictures so I wouldn't have to have you all walk out there in the rain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10410)|
| 2:53:36| and see in reality what's going on in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| And the only reason is we've had testimony tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| We have a real serious storm water issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| The reason I keep bringing Ms. Cole's in is because I wanted to use it as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| We've got a man's house here that's floating away underneath him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| And I'm here to tell you, if you get moisture underneath your house and you have tile floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10434)|
| 2:53:59| you're up a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| Big time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| Your doors will skid off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| Your sheetrock will crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10444)|
| 2:54:05| Your floors will pop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| It's a serious situation, and that's a constructional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10447)|
| 2:54:12| So what we're trying to do, and I'm not going to belabor Bruce because I'm not going to bring him up here as an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10452)|
| 2:54:20| but, you know, because the answers I always get out of the department is we'll have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| We'll have to find more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| We'll have to see more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| I don't see what you say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| And I don't know what county commission can do about this other than we may be making a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10470)|
| 2:54:35| where we may do a demonstration project next year on how to remediate streams as part of a training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10475)|
| 2:54:43| for our storm water people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10483)|
| 2:54:44| We can do that without any problems with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10484)|
| 2:54:50| And the money will probably have to come from some department that that's under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10490)|
| 2:54:57| I don't know how we could get this issue straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| But we're going to have to start thinking about, as a commission, what we're going to do with the problems that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| already have, not just storm water ordinances that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| We had a gentleman walk in here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| I mean, his life is flowing away underneath him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:16| I am 100 percent for development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10516)|
| 2:55:21| We need development to have our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| We need development for places for people to live and people to play and people to have recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10524)|
| 2:55:30| and people to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| But when my land starts messing up your land and when my house starts messing up your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10533)|
| 2:55:39| it's incumbent upon us as a community here together to address these problems and to solve these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:47| And this man over here has got a serious problem, but we've got to investigate it to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| By the time we investigate his problem to death, his house will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| And we don't we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| It's really evidently the reality of county commission is that we don't have any authority at all in this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10557)|
| 2:56:04| because I've never seen anything happen from whether it be the green disposal since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| whether it be lost money since I've been here, whether it be this man's house floating away since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10570)|
| 2:56:15| whether it be Laura Cole's property for the last three years and since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| It's quite evident that we have no authority in Knox County at all other than we can sit here and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10580)|
| 2:56:27| And if that's all the authority that I and the 8th District Commission Seat A has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| then I'm going to talk about it until I'm no longer in the 8th District Commission Seat A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10593)|
| 2:56:38| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| But I wanted to at least bring the reality to you tonight as to what happened just Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:45| and just a week before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| And, I mean, I hate to say I'm just an old country boy, but I know muddy water when I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| And I don't need a Ph.D. in dirt to know when I know when dirt's flowing in water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| And I know when the stream stops flowing, sediment settles, and it ruins streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10616)|
| 2:57:02| And I do know that we may need to get an independent body to come in and look at these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10622)|
| 2:57:09| I am not opposed to going to Atlanta and getting EPA Region 4 up here in a heartbeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10629)|
| 2:57:14| I come out of the environmental world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| I know a lot of people down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| I'm more than willing to call in one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| I have a wetland expert and water expert that is a personal friend of mine with a Ph.D. in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10641)|
| 2:57:27| I've got no problem calling him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| See if he'll come in here and see if he recognizes dirt when he sees it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| I hate to say dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10653)|
| 2:57:34| They hate to say dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:35| Soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10655)|
| 2:57:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10656)|
| 2:57:37| And see if the soil is rivet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| And see if we really have plant life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| And see if it's really being endangered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| And see if the oxidation is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| And see if all these scientific elements are really there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| I believe they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10668)|
| 2:57:48| And I know that agricultural related to Ms. Cole's property is all downstream, not upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10668)|
| 2:57:53| So it can't be agricultural problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| There's no agricultural at the top of this watershed flowing into her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| It's all beyond her and down below her watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10679)|
| 2:58:04| So I'm thinking about personally looking at see if we can't get some help from the Corps of Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| It's quite evident we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| And get some help from the Environmental Protection Agency out of Atlanta where people maybe can give us some advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10691)|
| 2:58:17| as to how to handle water that disappears and reappears or flows across the surface underneath grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:23| and gathers dirt or soil and leaves sediment deposits in the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10703)|
| 2:58:28| And we don't know what to do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| So if we as Knox County have met a point of where we don't know what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| then maybe we need to look out elsewhere to see if we can help solve these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10714)|
| 2:58:39| Because as we had testimony tonight, we have a serious stormwater problem in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:46| I don't want to burden on our builders, but it can be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| But I don't want to harm my neighbor when I'm doing something in my yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10730)|
| 2:58:54| and I don't want my neighbor to harm me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| And it's happening all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10736)|
| 2:58:58| And we as a body sit here and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10738)|
| 2:59:01| And nothing's ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| But that's my discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10743)|
| 2:59:04| Anybody else has any comments, they're more than welcome to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| I was just going to make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| And, I mean, these are really serious problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| But some of these are where, you know, we've heard the elderly gentleman that comes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| that's having a problem with his children or other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| We have the incident that occurred today, which is just terrible, with the gentleman in his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| where this individual is flooding him and causing him harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| And, of course, the creek problem is also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| But sometimes this is where individuals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| We need to change our ordinances so they're stricter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| But when damage, when one individual is causing damage to another, what authority does the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10784)|
| 2:59:50| I mean, usually these things are taken care of in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| And, I mean, I think there's some things that we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10793)|
| 2:59:57| I mean, we can set rules and regulations and set stormwater ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10797)|
| 3:00:03| But if harm actually occurs after that's been done, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| is this the place where this needs to be adjudicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| Or can this be handled in the courts where the person causing the damage has to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10809)|
| 3:00:14| And, I mean, I don't want Knox County having to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| I mean, there's a case that I brought to the stormwater people where a gentleman over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10817)|
| 3:00:21| where I live is being flooded by a commercial building next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10821)|
| 3:00:27| But it seems like that who's causing the harm should have to pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10827)|
| 3:00:33| And just like the elderly gentleman who's having a problem with his driver's license and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| it seems like some of these things need to be adjudicated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| And it's the same thing with Brad Bay's issue is that some of this needs to be handled in the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10842)|
| 3:00:48| and not here because they're the ones that have the authority to do something about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| and pay for the damages if one individual has harmed another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10853)|
| 3:00:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10861)|
| 3:01:04| Yeah, this continues to go on, obviously, and it's tiresome to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10864)|
| 3:01:09| The body knows that the stormwater ordinance is going to be reviewed as part of our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10869)|
| 3:01:18| There's a couple of things that come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| and if it's permissible to the chair for Mr. Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10880)|
| 3:01:27| and I to discuss this across the way here as we bring this topic up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10887)|
| 3:01:34| I'd like to do that because we never do discuss it except when it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10894)|
| 3:01:41| One thing that I've noticed in the code is that the director, Mr. Weitrick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10901)|
| 3:01:52| has fairly broad discretionary powers about how he can, what he will do or what he might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10912)|
| 3:01:59| And this is, I may need Mr. Jarrett to weigh in on that, but I looked up a couple of items from the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10919)|
| 3:02:08| and this is from Chapter 26, Environment, Section 26-252, Section D and L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10928)|
| 3:02:19| And I'm just going to read this right quick to illustrate how discretionary his powers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10939)|
| 3:02:26| And Section D says that the director may require more stringent standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10946)|
| 3:02:32| or best management practices than those required by the state general NPDES permit for discharges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:38| of stormwater associated with construction sites for priority construction activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10958)|
| 3:02:44| or where deemed necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| And then in Section L, the director shall have the authority to require greater than 70 percent coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:53| of perennial vegetation, blah, blah, blah, for erosion prevention, sediment control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10973)|
| 3:03:01| control portion of the performance bond if the site is a priority construction activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| has elevated potential of erosion or offsite damages or has caused past damages offsite due to sediment discharges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10986)|
| 3:03:15| So these items that are in our code, I think, empower the director in this situation to do, to address the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=10995)|
| 3:03:29| And the stormwater department continues to come before us and say that we can't do anything according to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:39| And I don't think that's necessarily so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| I don't know what Mr. Armstrong thinks about that, but it sounds to me, and I'm not a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11024)|
| 3:03:51| and Mr. Armstrong is a lawyer, but it sounds to me like given the length of time that we've dealt with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11031)|
| 3:04:01| discussed it, had it before us, that it's time for our engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:09| and stormwater department in particular to say, we're going to address this in the following ways, rather than say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11049)|
| 3:04:18| we're going to study it again and say, well, we're just not sure where that water's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| It's going underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11062)|
| 3:04:23| It may be underground erosion or whatever from another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| It's apparent it's coming from the developed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| It's coming from lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11071)|
| 3:04:35| And it's time for something to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| And I think it's time for the director to step up and say this is what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| I need to say one comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11089)|
| 3:04:52| Tony, I appreciate your comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| And Commissioner Briggs, I agree that there's a time for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| It sounds kind of funny and stupid coming from an attorney, but that's the last step I want to see taken is litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11099)|
| 3:05:07| And when the community comes to us as a body for solutions that we have an opportunity to provide solutions for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:15| and if there are violations, we have the leverage to put the leverage on these people to see that they fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11115)|
| 3:05:22| We have remedies at hand in different cases, and it's up to the director to see how this is going to be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| But we can actually go out and remediate, put liens on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| and take care of business at hand and correct things if we so deem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11132)|
| 3:05:36| And that's a policy decision and a budgetary decision and a departmental decision that has to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11136)|
| 3:05:43| Short of litigation and as a last fallback, even if all that's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11143)|
| 3:05:49| and damage is still there, they can litigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| But I think we need to at least show the community that we're willing to at least try to protect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11153)|
| 3:05:59| and enforce our ordinances and remediate any problems where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11159)|
| 3:06:05| That's just kind of where I'm standing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11165)|
| 3:06:11| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| Commissioner Armstrong, I was listening intently, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| And I do have a Ph.D., but it wasn't in dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| But I also listened intently to Commissioner Briggs, who ironically was giving good legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11181)|
| 3:06:25| and that is that torts are a remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11185)|
| 3:06:28| But like you said, torts are a last remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| I mean, when someone does wrong to someone else's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11191)|
| 3:06:34| you'd like to have your county government enforcing things properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11194)|
| 3:06:38| As Commissioner Norman pointed out, we seem to have a great deal of discretion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11198)|
| 3:06:44| and it's leading to sort of what I'm thinking is a lax approach to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11204)|
| 3:06:49| So I'm going to say something rather outrageous here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11209)|
| 3:06:52| The one power we do have, I mean, granted, you and I can go to EPA and complain, and we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11212)|
| 3:06:58| The one power that every legislative body has is that of the purse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:02| And if we don't get some action soon, I'd be happy to introduce legislation to have a moratorium on the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11222)|
| 3:07:07| budget or the entire public works budget until we get action to satisfy these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11227)|
| 3:07:13| because clearly we have an enforcement problem and we have too many people's properties being flooded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11233)|
| 3:07:19| improper enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| I'd be happy to go forward with that if we don't soon see action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11241)|
| 3:07:26| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| I'd like to remind everyone that Mr. Weitrick actually asked for more of a budget to add some stormwater people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11248)|
| 3:07:39| That's an argument, not a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11264)|
| 3:07:46| McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| I didn't get a commissioner in front of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:50| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11270)|
| 3:07:53| I guess I'm just wanting to kind of understand where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| I know Mr. Jarrett issued a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| And, Mr. Jarrett, if you could, if you don't mind, to kind of give a brief recap of what, well, I guess what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11279)|
| 3:08:06| We asked you to speak with, I guess it was TDAC, and you did that, and they issued a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11286)|
| 3:08:14| Could you kind of go over what that said about this cold property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:18| Yes, sir, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11298)|
| 3:08:19| What occurred, as you recall, the commission directed me to send a letter to TDAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11299)|
| 3:08:24| essentially asking for enforcement on the property of their rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11304)|
| 3:08:29| When I was inquiring as to the proper person to whom to send the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11309)|
| 3:08:33| I received an e-mail advising me that they had just sent out a letter on that very subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11313)|
| 3:08:39| essentially saying that they saw no further action they could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| So the bottom line is TDAC at this point feels there is no current pending violation for which enforcement lies in terms of TDAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11323)|
| 3:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| So we asked for that thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11334)|
| 3:08:59| I don't know what we were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| I guess some folks may have thought that that would be an arm or a hammer, and it quite frankly wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11340)|
| 3:09:06| They're happy with things the way they are on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11346)|
| 3:09:12| I guess one thing that bothered me through this whole dialogue, and I'm not trying to point a finger anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11352)|
| 3:09:20| but if we're going to solve this storm ordinance, it wasn't created, you know, in a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11360)|
| 3:09:27| and we passed a really tough ordinance a while ago, but it took us a long time to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:35| And I guess what I'm saying is it's going to take a community of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:41| One of the things that bothered me is that the gentleman that spoke earlier said that MPC voted that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11381)|
| 3:09:49| voted a tougher ordinance down, and Ms. Cole actually, in fact, voted not to kind of slap that guy on his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11389)|
| 3:09:59| And that's troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| I mean, it's going to take MPC, it's going to take the BZA, and it's going to take commission as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11400)|
| 3:10:07| we can beat up Bruce, but if Bruce doesn't have precedent to go out and enforce some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:12| In fact, TDAC is saying quite the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| You know, we can bash him, and that's great and it's fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| and everyone's looking at us on TV, but the reality of it is, I mean, he has certain guidelines to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11418)|
| 3:10:24| He has some leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11424)|
| 3:10:25| But if he goes out there enforcing things that TDAC is not going to back him on, then, you know, what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11425)|
| 3:10:33| What are we setting ourselves up for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| So I guess I'll say, you know, we can, and I don't mind discussing this every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| We can discuss Ms. Cole's property, this gentleman's property, and I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11440)|
| 3:10:47| We can have these discussions every month, and I'm, you know, will listen intently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:53| But I think the bottom line, I think we need to, I don't think this is the forum for it other than getting it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11453)|
| 3:11:00| and in the public eye, and I think we've done a pretty good job of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11460)|
| 3:11:04| I know this discussion item has been on the agenda for quite a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11464)|
| 3:11:10| So I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what is the end result of having these discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11470)|
| 3:11:16| month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11479)|
| 3:11:22| Go ahead, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| In regards to Ms. Cole's problem, when you go out and look at lot number 17, which has been brought up several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11484)|
| 3:11:30| the lot has been sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| It doesn't get any better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| So when someone says we're not enforcing the ordinance, in fact, we are enforcing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| I can't go out there and cite him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| There's nothing that we can see that he's in violation of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| That's not to say Ms. Cole does not have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| It just means I don't have any legal precedents or anything within the legal framework that I work under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11507)|
| 3:11:52| I go out there and cite someone and say you're in violation of this or you haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11512)|
| 3:11:56| The lot is sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| I mean, I wish every lot in Knox County was in that good of condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| So to say we're not enforcing the ordinance is simply untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11521)|
| 3:12:05| And then we brought TDEC in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| We didn't say that there was no violations out there because TDEC said that, but they came in and concurred with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11528)|
| 3:12:14| Bringing in the Environmental Protection Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| Any of these other agencies you want to bring in, I welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| Because, quite frankly, there is nothing else that I know that we can do within our legal framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11539)|
| 3:12:28| I'm not sure if the light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| It's in between Ivan and Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| Which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| I'll go next since I'm the smallest of the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| I work for the city stormwater engineering department, and I see situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| I can't believe that a guy can go out and build a golf course in a man's community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| without somebody in the community raising a cane about it and bringing it to the city or the county's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11567)|
| 3:12:54| We constantly have mediation in the city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| We charge these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| We have fined them up to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11578)|
| 3:13:00| I've seen them have to pay the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| I know we can do it, but we've got to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| And I'm not picking on Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11585)|
| 3:13:06| I'm not picking on his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11586)|
| 3:13:08| But he's got the teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11588)|
| 3:13:09| He's just going to start biting them a little bit, make it hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| Before they get the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| Now, once the problem's done, talking about the lot where the sod is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11593)|
| 3:13:17| if there's muddy water coming off that property, it may not be coming off that lot, but it's coming somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11597)|
| 3:13:22| So somebody needs to be there when it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11602)|
| 3:13:24| It may be on Sunday afternoon like Mr. Armstrong was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11604)|
| 3:13:27| but somebody needs to be there to see where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11607)|
| 3:13:32| You want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11612)|
| 3:13:33| Well, just so you know, we also issue fines, upwards to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11613)|
| 3:13:38| We've issued over $200,000 in fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| We're not, it's not, this situation is somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:45| This is not something that we're just saying, yeah, we know what the violation, we see the violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11625)|
| 3:13:49| we're not going to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| We've come back and say, we cannot find the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| I can't pin it on an individual or a project because physically you go out there and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11633)|
| 3:13:58| and you cannot see a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| You can see the results of a problem that's caused by, you can say it's caused by the development or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11640)|
| 3:14:05| You can see the results of it, but you can't see the source from where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11645)|
| 3:14:11| So I cannot in good conscience issue citations on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11651)|
| 3:14:16| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11658)|
| 3:14:19| I guess this comes back to a larger question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| and that is when I read in the paper that the head of our MPC says that our code enforcement is basically two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11662)|
| 3:14:28| in a truck, that bothers me, and I think we're going to be hearing here in just a moment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11668)|
| 3:14:33| But I think that as we look into our budget next year, we've got to really look at these provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11673)|
| 3:14:39| and seeing how we're going to enforce this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11679)|
| 3:14:42| But I guess my bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11682)|
| 3:14:45| If we know that on Ms. Cole's property that something is happening, we've called the state, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11685)|
| 3:14:51| we know something's happening, but nobody knows where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| Somebody can find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| I mean, there has to be a smart person in Knox County, Tennessee that can go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11697)|
| 3:15:01| and look at that and say this is where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| If we can't do it in Knox County, is there somebody that can go out there and tell us where this is coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11704)|
| 3:15:12| I would have to believe that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11712)|
| 3:15:15| And with regards to the gentleman's property here on the water, I mean, what needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11715)|
| 3:15:20| I mean, if we were to say, all right, here's what we need to do to fix this gentleman's problem, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11720)|
| 3:15:28| I would like to find out, like on Ms. Cole's property, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| We need to find somebody, hire somebody from outside to come in and go out there and look at it, give us a report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11732)|
| 3:15:38| But I'm with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| I mean, we can continue on month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11740)|
| 3:15:43| But if our code is being described as two people in a truck and every month we're coming back here and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11743)|
| 3:15:49| well, we don't know where this is coming from, we know there's a problem, but we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| then let's find somebody that can help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| And if this gentleman is having his home going down into the ground because of water problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11754)|
| 3:16:01| because of a golf course, what is it going to take to solve that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11761)|
| 3:16:06| And so somebody has to be able to tell us that instead of, well, let's look at it, let's write a letter to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11766)|
| 3:16:12| Somebody knows how to fix this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| And I'd like to find out who that person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| And I don't know, you know, maybe we, I know there are engineering firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| I know there are people here that can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| I'm just throwing this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| Somebody has to know how to fix this problem and what we need to do to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11785)|
| 3:16:32| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| I'm going to try to get back again to the point I was trying to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| and it really goes along with what everyone else has said also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| But particularly that home that's being damaged by the water really, really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:46| And it doesn't seem right that someone can build a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11806)|
| 3:16:50| The things, the drainage isn't proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| He just sort of does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11812)|
| 3:16:53| And then the Knox County taxpayers and an individual who owns a home has to pick up the bill for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11813)|
| 3:16:59| Now, if that requires, it seems like that the person who's causing the damage should be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11819)|
| 3:17:05| It's not a matter of getting a fine of $500 or something, but he caused the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| He should have to pay to stop the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| And if he's caused damage to the gentleman's house, then he should have to pay to repair that damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11832)|
| 3:17:17| And it's the same thing with Mrs. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11837)|
| 3:17:20| It shouldn't be Knox County that's having to do all of this for damage that someone else has caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11840)|
| 3:17:26| It should be the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11846)|
| 3:17:27| I'm not talking about even enforcing codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| It's the fact that someone caused the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11849)|
| 3:17:32| They should have to be paying to get it drained properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| And if they caused damage to their creek, it shouldn't be us that's cleaning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| It should be the person that damaged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11857)|
| 3:17:42| Because this is Knox County taxpayer dollars that's basically subsidizing these people that just put something up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11862)|
| 3:17:48| and they expect us to pick up the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11868)|
| 3:17:51| Or a homeowner or someone that owns a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11871)|
| 3:17:56| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11876)|
| 3:17:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| Mr. Weitrich, when you say that there's nothing, and I'm not by no means am I saying that you're not holding the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11881)|
| 3:18:11| I think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| And, of course, that's one of our basic problems is our ordinance doesn't, is not able to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11893)|
| 3:18:21| And that's something for us to take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| But when we talk about your discretionary powers and the length of time that we dealt with this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11903)|
| 3:18:34| are you saying that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that you can see, that you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11914)|
| 3:18:42| that Knox County can require to help the situation of muddy water in her creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11922)|
| 3:18:51| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11931)|
| 3:18:52| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| At our last inspection, I'm not aware of any violations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11934)|
| 3:18:57| So to answer your question, I'm not aware of anything else we can make that developer do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11937)|
| 3:19:03| So the owner of lot 17 is who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11943)|
| 3:19:08| I believe it is still owned by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11948)|
| 3:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11951)|
| 3:19:12| I don't think that house is sold yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| So and you said that that lot is sodded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11955)|
| 3:19:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11960)|
| 3:19:21| In fact, I got photographs of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11961)|
| 3:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11962)|
| 3:19:23| That means that there is no, there are no portions of bare ground on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:29| The only bare portions of ground on that lot are immediately adjacent to the foundation where you typically would put in your landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11969)|
| 3:19:36| It's up against the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| So I doubt that that is, that's a contributing factor to what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| So in your estimation, there is no chance that there is sediment-laden runoff that is coming none from lot 17 because it's sodded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11981)|
| 3:19:53| I'm not going to say there's no chance that there's any sediment-laden water coming from that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11993)|
| 3:19:58| All I'm saying is they've got the lot sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| The only disturbed area is adjacent to the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| So that's not a violation of the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12004)|
| 3:20:08| They are in compliance with the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12008)|
| 3:20:10| So when we look at the limits of that property, Mr. Lambert's got a shot of a silt fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12010)|
| 3:20:24| and it's just, it's got ponded muddy water around the silt fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12024)|
| 3:20:31| Where can that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| I don't know where that photograph was taken from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| I'm just telling you what I'm aware of on lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12035)|
| 3:20:40| So you can't, you're just, we can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12040)|
| 3:20:45| Given our ordinance, we cannot require the developer at lot 17 just talking about that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12045)|
| 3:20:51| There's nothing that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| I'm not aware of any violations on lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12053)|
| 3:21:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12060)|
| 3:21:03| I just want to get, again, just historically, could you give me an estimate of how many complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12063)|
| 3:21:10| and how much we have required in terms of NOVs for the history of this Graysburg development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12070)|
| 3:21:22| I can't on Graysburg specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| I can tell you how many we've issued countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12084)|
| 3:21:28| I can find that information out for you, but not stand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12088)|
| 3:21:30| Do you have any rough estimate of how many, how much in the way of funds that we've levied on Graysburg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12090)|
| 3:21:39| We have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| I do not have it that I can give to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| Would you say it's in the thousands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| I wouldn't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12106)|
| 3:21:47| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:48| No way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12108)|
| 3:21:49| Well, because I have the information, because it is the number I can find out, I don't want to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12109)|
| 3:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12113)|
| 3:21:54| Would you guess at the number of complaints that we've had about Graysburg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| Here again, and I'm not trying to be evasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12119)|
| 3:22:02| It's just that I'm not going to be aware of every single complaint that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| I mean, we literally get dozens of phone calls on a weekly basis about drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| I don't hear every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| So I would have to, these are numbers I can get for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| But standing here, I cannot provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12135)|
| 3:22:16| I'd like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12136)|
| 3:22:17| I'd like a summary report on Graysburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| Could you do that for us for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12141)|
| 3:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12145)|
| 3:22:26| I'd like to ask, Mr. Chairman, if we could move on with the ordinance that we have to deal with on page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12146)|
| 3:22:32| We've got people in the audience, I believe, that are concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| And I'd like to, we can sit here and banter all night, but I'd like for the people that are here on this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12155)|
| 3:22:42| we could go ahead and debate that if you don't care, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| Well, that item you're talking about can't be heard until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12165)|
| 3:22:51| It's part of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| I checked on it before the commission meeting even started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12173)|
| 3:23:01| Is there any more discussion on Ms. Cole's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12181)|
| 3:23:04| If not, moving on to a discussion item regarding the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12184)|
| 3:23:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12192)|
| 3:23:16| Let me go find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12196)|
| 3:23:22| Go ahead and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12202)|
| 3:23:26| Discussion regarding MPC and development considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12206)|
| 3:23:29| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12209)|
| 3:23:33| Finance, 10-0 to send to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| 6-0 to send on to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| Now, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12220)|
| 3:23:43| In early December, Commissioner Briggs and Shouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| and I heard Trey Benefio, the current chairman of the MPC, talk at the Council of West Knox County Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12227)|
| 3:23:54| and he did a wonderful review of past development, not specific developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12234)|
| 3:24:00| but development practices and then began to look to the future, to the next 15 or 20 years in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12240)|
| 3:24:07| And the three of us thought it was sufficiently interesting and should be shared with this entire commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12247)|
| 3:24:13| We asked Trey to come and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| He has been the chair for two years and I understand concludes his term this next MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12255)|
| 3:24:21| Last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| In county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12264)|
| 3:24:25| He, I think, has tried to conduct the affairs of the commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12265)|
| 3:24:31| in a thorough and a listening manner, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| And I hope you will give your attention to Mr. Greenfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| and perhaps we can learn something about the future of development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:43| Thank you for coming, Trey, and thank you for being so patient as we got to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12283)|
| 3:24:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12287)|
| 3:24:48| And I appreciate you all patiently addressing the issues of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12288)|
| 3:24:54| I've sat in your seats and I know how tedious it can become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12294)|
| 3:24:57| And the thoroughness, I think you all have to be commended for taking the time to really study these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12297)|
| 3:25:06| and discuss them and run them to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12306)|
| 3:25:08| Our discussions have gotten more lengthy on the planning commission lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12308)|
| 3:25:12| I think we do better business that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| I think it's a good thing that you all do take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| and thoroughly address the issues that are before the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| To talk about the future of planning, I think we'll start by looking back at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12321)|
| 3:25:27| You know, planning is something that we've been doing for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12327)|
| 3:25:30| In the Bible, it says that man should take dominion over the earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12330)|
| 3:25:34| and it goes on with specific instructions from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12334)|
| 3:25:37| But it gives a history of how long people have been trying to dominate their world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12337)|
| 3:25:42| I look at, you know, the Egyptians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| The arrangement of the pyramids had some order to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12345)|
| 3:25:48| Now, it had some cosmic order related to the alignment of the stars or whatever else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12348)|
| 3:25:51| but it speaks to the fact that people want to manipulate the earth to their liking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12351)|
| 3:25:58| We move forward to the city of Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12358)|
| 3:26:02| 628 B.C. is the first evidence of analysis of the need for agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12362)|
| 3:26:08| and transportation in planning out cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| And you look at Rome today, it appears to still be functioning fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:14| So that's some validity for the work of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12374)|
| 3:26:18| More recently, though, in talking about what drives the type of planning we do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12378)|
| 3:26:26| if we look at the late 1800s and early 1900s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12386)|
| 3:26:30| the development of tenement construction in New York City was so dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12390)|
| 3:26:35| The group of people were so tight in that area around heavy industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:42| that New York City developed the first comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| It was called the New York City Zone Building Resolution of 1916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12406)|
| 3:26:52| So that's the beginning of the kind of planning that we do today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| that affects what we're doing here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| More importantly, in Ohio, there was a realty company called the Ambler Realty Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12417)|
| 3:27:03| that was pushing industrial development in a way that it encroached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12423)|
| 3:27:09| on existing residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| And through the arguments between the city of Euclid in Ohio and Ambler Realty Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12432)|
| 3:27:18| it went to the Supreme Court and validated the concept of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12438)|
| 3:27:22| And this is the law that we practice zoning under today here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12442)|
| 3:27:26| In these early contexts of industry encroaching on established residences of high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12446)|
| 3:27:34| and proximity to noxious and dangerous activities, zoning was very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12454)|
| 3:27:40| We look today at what we do, and we have these long, protracted discussions over 3.6 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12460)|
| 3:27:46| versus 3.8 units per acre, and it's a far cry from the dramatic zoning implication that we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12466)|
| 3:27:56| I think that what I'm trying to say is that some of the rules that we've made have led to a perversion of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12476)|
| 3:28:06| And, you know, we all made these rules, and we all zoned these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12486)|
| 3:28:11| we meaning the Planning Commission and you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| But we need to be aware that it's probably time for another revolution in the thought of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12493)|
| 3:28:18| and we're starting to see the glimpses of that, and we'll talk about that here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12498)|
| 3:28:22| You know, you look at the rules that we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12502)|
| 3:28:24| and, you know, I feel for Mr. Weitrick here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12504)|
| 3:28:26| He's following all the rules, and best I can tell, the developer was probably following all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| The grass, you know, the place is sodded and everything, but we have a situation that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| It's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:37| Drive down Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12517)|
| 3:28:40| Everything that was built on Clinton Highway was built by following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12520)|
| 3:28:44| When we put all those rules in place one at a time, is Clinton Highway the vision that we had in place for the best our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12524)|
| 3:28:50| community could be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12530)|
| 3:28:53| You know, we just need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| All these rules that we build, they'll have, I think I heard somebody use the term earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12535)|
| 3:28:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:00| What do you consider wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12540)|
| 3:29:05| Let him finish and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12545)|
| 3:29:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12549)|
| 3:29:10| What do you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12550)|
| 3:29:11| Sir, you know, and I appreciate planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12551)|
| 3:29:16| But I live on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12556)|
| 3:29:19| and out there we're very proud of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12559)|
| 3:29:23| And it may not be as nice as the gated subdivision that you live in, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12563)|
| 3:29:28| but the people that own property up and down that highway, what is going in out there is what the demographics will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12568)|
| 3:29:39| Now, the demographics of our area are raising, and so are the businesses that are located in that area, sir, are raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12579)|
| 3:29:49| We have got fine restaurants now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| We have fine shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| Can we talk for a second, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12593)|
| 3:29:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12594)|
| 3:29:55| I'm not talking about what was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| What I'm talking about is the extent of paving, the exclusivity of one land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12597)|
| 3:30:02| There's only commercial for miles and miles and miles down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12602)|
| 3:30:08| What it requires is it's a very inefficient use of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12608)|
| 3:30:12| What we've got is vast areas of residential and over here vast areas of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12612)|
| 3:30:18| And there's no place for industry in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| That's the problem that I'm trying to point to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| When you drive down Clinton Highway, you see flashy signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| You see, you know, a whole lot of pavement and a whole lot of lights on your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12625)|
| 3:30:29| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12629)|
| 3:30:31| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| I'm not going to say that economically it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| But it's not the most efficient way to build a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| Well, I mean, it's within that community, the businesses that are located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12638)|
| 3:30:43| And there are mixed uses that are being planned in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| I know down on Beaver Creek Drive there's some mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| And I'm fully supportive of mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12649)|
| 3:30:53| But, you know, I understand your neighborhood, sir, and you go down to Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12653)|
| 3:30:57| and you see those wonderful condos that are built just off of the Turkey Creek shopping area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12657)|
| 3:31:02| Those are modern developments built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12662)|
| 3:31:06| Condos at Turkey Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12666)|
| 3:31:07| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12667)|
| 3:31:08| Well, there's, yeah, back in the cove in there, there's a condo's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| Are those pods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| Small but very nice houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12673)|
| 3:31:18| Yeah, that's barely mixed use if you're talking about Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12678)|
| 3:31:20| At any rate, I apologize if I insulted you when I talked about Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12680)|
| 3:31:24| Well, I mean, you pick on my area and you insult me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12684)|
| 3:31:27| Commissioner Labrador, let him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12687)|
| 3:31:32| All right, so this is what the -.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| No, you started it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12693)|
| 3:31:34| You said let him come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12694)|
| 3:31:35| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12695)|
| 3:31:36| I should have known better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| Okay, so the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12699)|
| 3:31:43| The first thing I'd like to say is that communities all across the country are wrestling with what they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12703)|
| 3:31:52| built and how they're planning versus quality in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12712)|
| 3:31:57| I had the opportunity a couple of years ago to go to Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| And Europe addresses, the towns in Europe address zoning very differently than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12719)|
| 3:32:04| I think the big thing is that Europe was primarily built before the advent of the automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| And our country was mostly built after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| It was built on a vehicular scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| They mix uses very comfortably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| When you see, I don't think that at any time I was in Europe I was out of walking distance of basic commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12735)|
| 3:32:23| out of distance of a pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12743)|
| 3:32:27| For that matter, I think I was pretty close to a bar almost all the time I was in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12747)|
| 3:32:31| And it was comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12751)|
| 3:32:32| It can be done in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| Having these uses mixed into your community do not detract from the community in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12754)|
| 3:32:40| Some of the things that we're going to have to deal with, we're going to have to come to terms with our environmental policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12760)|
| 3:32:45| Our air quality is abysmal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| It's absolutely a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12768)|
| 3:32:50| Last year we were eighth worst in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12770)|
| 3:32:54| And that is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| When I hear on the radio not to go outside on one of these warm summer days because air quality is unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12776)|
| 3:33:04| that I find that completely unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12784)|
| 3:33:08| Similarly, the water quality, like the issue that we were just hearing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12788)|
| 3:33:11| that Commissioner Armstrong spoke so eloquently about, that's a factor that we need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12791)|
| 3:33:16| We need to address our water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12796)|
| 3:33:19| As I said before, industry needs to we need to find some way to integrate industry into our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12799)|
| 3:33:25| We don't, as you all know, you all wrestle with the budget as much as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12805)|
| 3:33:29| I don't think we generate enough tax dollars off of all the residential development that we've built in the last ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12809)|
| 3:33:35| to support the schools and the other infrastructure and the parks and the other infrastructure that we're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12815)|
| 3:33:40| We need to have things that generate more tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:42| And we need to integrate these things comfortably into what we've already got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12822)|
| 3:33:46| We have built, we've developed subdivisions on 35.7 square miles, I think, of land in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12826)|
| 3:33:55| If we were to do that another ten years, I think we would pretty much be out of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12835)|
| 3:34:00| definitely the most suitable land for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12840)|
| 3:34:05| So that's why you see a lot of these things coming up about the hillside and slopeside task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12845)|
| 3:34:10| because we're being pushed into the more difficult land to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12850)|
| 3:34:16| I think there's going to be some evolution as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| I think that the residential market is going to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12859)|
| 3:34:22| As Commissioner Lambert said, smaller houses are becoming more popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12862)|
| 3:34:26| even in the very high ends of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12866)|
| 3:34:30| Multifamily is going to continue to become more popular, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12870)|
| 3:34:33| I think that the economy is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12873)|
| 3:34:35| People are going to want to spend less on their house, and they're probably going to want to drive less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12875)|
| 3:34:40| So I think our transportation infrastructure is going to be very differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12880)|
| 3:34:43| I think that in the next ten to 15 years, we're going to stop building subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12883)|
| 3:34:48| the gated community that you referred to, which, by the way, I do not live in a gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12888)|
| 3:34:53| Those communities with 10,000 square foot houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| I don't think we're going to build subdivisions full of houses that are that big on into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12896)|
| 3:35:01| I don't think that's a sustainable fashion, neither economically nor environmentally nor socially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12901)|
| 3:35:07| I think that that is going to have to evolve, and I think that we need to be aware of that in the planning that we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12907)|
| 3:35:15| There is some good news in our community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12915)|
| 3:35:19| You know, as a community, what I'm seeing is that people are getting better about asking for what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12919)|
| 3:35:27| When I first started on commission, there was a zoning code in these sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12927)|
| 3:35:30| and very small participation in the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12930)|
| 3:35:33| But what we're seeing now is people participating in small area plans like the South Knox Waterfront, like Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12933)|
| 3:35:42| And also these other things that are coming up, like I mentioned, the Ridge Slope and Hillside Protection Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12942)|
| 3:35:48| These are efforts of the community to ask for what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| and help define what community we're going to have for the next 10 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12951)|
| 3:35:57| Along with that, we're seeing the transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12957)|
| 3:36:00| We're seeing form-based codes, and we're also working on a set of sustainable development incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12960)|
| 3:36:07| So this is the evolution that I think is going to change our zoning code into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12967)|
| 3:36:12| I think the form-based codes are going to be very significant on into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12972)|
| 3:36:16| So you guys just asked me to give you all a heads-up as to what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12976)|
| 3:36:21| I do apologize for insulting your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| I didn't mean to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| What I said was what I meant is that we have a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12985)|
| 3:36:29| My father and my uncle have a piece of property out in that area that is perfect for mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12989)|
| 3:36:35| That has been the whole plan all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| And now you want to propose regulations that would render it totally without value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=12998)|
| 3:36:46| I'm not proposing anything today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13006)|
| 3:36:47| Here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13007)|
| 3:36:48| If you had a blank canvas, take Alcoa Highway, Kingston Pike, anything, blank, nothing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13008)|
| 3:36:56| and you said, this is what we want, you know, what would it look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| Would it look like it turned out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13020)|
| 3:37:02| Or did our rules accomplish what we wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13022)|
| 3:37:06| Well, first of all, we don't have a blank canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13026)|
| 3:37:08| You can't erase everything that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| And in Europe, and, sir, I've traveled all over Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13030)|
| 3:37:14| In Europe, they didn't start with a blank canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13034)|
| 3:37:18| It evolved over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13038)|
| 3:37:19| Now, if you look at the American culture that we enjoy, and, yes, it's going to have to alter somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13039)|
| 3:37:26| We had a large mass of land, and we spread out to fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13046)|
| 3:37:32| Houses have been bigger in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13052)|
| 3:37:34| Cars have been bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| If you even look at the way our motorcycles are designed, the Harley-Davidson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13056)|
| 3:37:40| the all-American machine is designed to go long distances on big stretches of open road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13060)|
| 3:37:47| whereas the European-style motorcycles are for twisting and winding around very short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13067)|
| 3:37:54| fast trips on winding roads because those roads evolved from cart paths from ancient civilizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13074)|
| 3:38:01| And, yes, as their population density and as their economy changes, we are going to gravitate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13081)|
| 3:38:08| whether through planning or rather through simple economic evolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13088)|
| 3:38:14| we are going to gravitate toward more mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| And myself, I live on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| I live a half of a mile from my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13100)|
| 3:38:23| I am certainly a proponent of the style of living that you're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13103)|
| 3:38:29| And I think that over the years Americans will naturally gravitate toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13109)|
| 3:38:34| But that doesn't mean that our forefathers, back when the roads were open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13114)|
| 3:38:39| and there was lots of space to expand into, that doesn't mean that they were wrong, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13119)|
| 3:38:43| It means that they had the land to grow into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13123)|
| 3:38:46| And had they had that in Germany, had they had that in England,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| I would challenge that they would have probably grown into it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13129)|
| 3:38:53| But to pick one area of town that is, and we are just on our upward swing, it's starting to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13133)|
| 3:39:01| I know when we first bought property on Clinton Highway, it was nothing but redneck beer joints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13141)|
| 3:39:07| And it's changed significantly, and it will continue to change significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| It's nothing to do with that area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13151)|
| 3:39:13| It's nothing to do with the type of folks that live on that area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13153)|
| 3:39:17| It is quite simply the economics of the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13157)|
| 3:39:20| And now that property is more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13160)|
| 3:39:22| So instead of little redneck dives, you're seeing Ruby Tuesdays and Chili's and places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13162)|
| 3:39:29| And given time, we're probably going to look as nice as Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13169)|
| 3:39:36| I have a lot to say to that, but we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13176)|
| 3:39:41| Is it my place to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| I'm used to driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13183)|
| 3:39:44| I just wanted to say thank you for your service to the county and the city on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13184)|
| 3:39:51| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13191)|
| 3:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13192)|
| 3:39:53| I've enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| Commissioner Hammond, you have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13194)|
| 3:39:55| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13195)|
| 3:39:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13196)|
| 3:39:57| And, again, thank you for your service and everything that you've done on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13197)|
| 3:40:00| Many times it's a thankless job, but you've persevered, and thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13200)|
| 3:40:04| I do have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13204)|
| 3:40:05| You mentioned about the sector plan and the small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13205)|
| 3:40:09| Do you foresee us, you know, when you talk about the sector plan, it seems to me that we've, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13209)|
| 3:40:15| we've grown to the point where looking at an entire sector may not be as feasible as looking at a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13215)|
| 3:40:21| Do you see us maybe moving into that to where we're maybe taking the sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13221)|
| 3:40:24| and moving them into more small area development plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13224)|
| 3:40:30| If I had my way, we'd actually do both in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13230)|
| 3:40:39| I think there are too many sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13239)|
| 3:40:42| I think it's very difficult to get the community participation that we need when I can't remember how many sector plans we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13242)|
| 3:40:50| but it's a handful, and they're actually too small of a geographic area in my personal opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13250)|
| 3:40:56| to attract the kind of attention that we need to get the community participation to have a viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13256)|
| 3:41:01| meaningful sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| At the same time, there will always be a need for small area plans to complement those sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13263)|
| 3:41:09| And the small area can be a few blocks, you know, the Bearden area, you know, a district or whatever it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13269)|
| 3:41:17| But so I think to answer your question, I think we need to go in both directions, more small area plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13277)|
| 3:41:22| but more mass to the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13282)|
| 3:41:26| Now, this notion of the two-minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13286)|
| 3:41:29| I'm by myself on that, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13290)|
| 3:41:31| Well, we're talking about, like, Cumberland Avenue, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13291)|
| 3:41:34| I know that there are a lot of people that are focused kind of on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13294)|
| 3:41:37| They're focused on the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| The Bearden district is another example of how the people there have gotten together, and they've said, hey, let's improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13299)|
| 3:41:43| Here are some things we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13303)|
| 3:41:44| And so you've seen, you know, quite a bit of participation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13304)|
| 3:41:48| Now, the whole, I read your comments, the two men in a truck thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| I read those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13312)|
| 3:41:53| And I mentioned it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13313)|
| 3:41:54| Now, your thoughts on enforcement and where we need to go with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13314)|
| 3:42:00| Yeah, as Mr. Sanders said, I spoke at the West Knox Homeowners Association meeting the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13320)|
| 3:42:06| and it was nice to read the paper the next day and found out what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13326)|
| 3:42:16| We get a lot of heat for what gets built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13336)|
| 3:42:19| and ultimately what gets built is much more important than what is planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13339)|
| 3:42:24| The planning commission only has the ability to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13344)|
| 3:42:28| There's nobody in the planning commission that goes out to make sure that things are built the way that we expected them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13348)|
| 3:42:34| when we approved the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13354)|
| 3:42:36| The limited research that I've been able to do points to the fact that the entities responsible for enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13356)|
| 3:42:44| simply don't have the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13364)|
| 3:42:46| And honestly, if I was strapped for resources, I would be focused on life safety code, on property protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13366)|
| 3:42:54| and things like sidewalks and landscaping would probably take a back seat if I had to make those choices as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13374)|
| 3:43:01| That being said, sidewalks and landscaping are what's going to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13381)|
| 3:43:06| and all the things that are proposed for these developments are what's going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13386)|
| 3:43:11| continue to make this community high quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| My final question is codes enforcement now is under the umbrella of the mayor's office, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13395)|
| 3:43:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13401)|
| 3:43:22| Now, what would you suggest in terms of a structural, and I'm asking you this because you're not serving anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13402)|
| 3:43:29| so you can get, you know, that's why I think it's really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13409)|
| 3:43:32| But I'm not here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| Should MPC have more of a say in what the codes people are doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13414)|
| 3:43:40| Like you say, you know, what is built more as opposed to what is planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13420)|
| 3:43:45| I mean, is there a structural change that you feel needs to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13425)|
| 3:43:49| I haven't thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13429)|
| 3:43:51| I had always thought of it just in terms of beefing up the structure that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13431)|
| 3:43:57| And honestly, I think that expertise is in a good location administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13437)|
| 3:44:02| I don't see a problem with the way that it's structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13442)|
| 3:44:05| I think it just needs a little more muscle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13445)|
| 3:44:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13451)|
| 3:44:12| Thank you, Trey, for, again, for your leadership on MPC and your leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13452)|
| 3:44:18| and you have this long and broad view of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13458)|
| 3:44:23| and Knox County and development and the communities indebted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13463)|
| 3:44:28| We appreciate the way that you have taken this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13468)|
| 3:44:34| and it's become, you've become somewhat of a champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13474)|
| 3:44:39| Don't want to overuse that champion word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| It gets used a lot, but you have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| And so I think that certainly we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13483)|
| 3:44:49| And I really, for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| I've gotten to know you somewhat in one of those groups on a personal level somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13492)|
| 3:44:57| and I understand why you're in the positions that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13497)|
| 3:45:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13501)|
| 3:45:04| Seeing no other lights, we'll go on to the next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13504)|
| 3:45:07| Thank you, Trey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13507)|
| 3:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13509)|
| 3:45:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13510)|
| 3:45:11| The next item is a discussion regarding quiet zones at railroad crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13511)|
| 3:45:17| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13517)|
| 3:45:19| N.O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13519)|
| 3:45:20| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13520)|
| 3:45:23| Six O's in the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13523)|
| 3:45:27| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| Over the last, I don't know, couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| I've been receiving a lot of e-mails and contacts from people, particularly one neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13533)|
| 3:45:40| and about the continuous blowing of horns by the train going through very close to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13540)|
| 3:45:49| There's a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13549)|
| 3:45:50| In fact, there's a lot of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13550)|
| 3:45:51| I'm surprised I've not heard from some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13551)|
| 3:45:54| I guess this other thing just got a little more organized about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13554)|
| 3:45:58| And I contacted both Bruce Weitrick and the law department about is there anything we can do about the trains blowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13558)|
| 3:46:10| their horns all night long as they go by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13570)|
| 3:46:16| Because it does seem to be quite a nuisance for those folks that live near the tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13576)|
| 3:46:22| And as we took a look a little closer, then I started thinking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13582)|
