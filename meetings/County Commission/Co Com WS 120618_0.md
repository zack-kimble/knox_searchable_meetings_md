| 0:00:00| Good afternoon everyone. It is 2 o'clock. I'd like to call into session the June workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| session of the Knox County Commission. Clerk, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=5)|
| 0:00:09| Commissioner McKenzie. Commissioner Brawls. Commissioner Norman. Here. Commissioner Wembe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=9)|
| 0:00:15| Here. Commissioner Briggs. Commissioner Anders. Here. Commissioner Smith. Here. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=15)|
| 0:00:22| Wright. Here. Commissioner Brown. Here. Commissioner Hammond. Here. Commissioner Shouse. We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=22)|
| 0:00:28| have a quorum of commissioners present. Seven members are here. Commissioner Smith, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| you lead us in the Pledge of the Flag, please? Please stand. Salute our nation's flag. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=33)|
| 0:00:41| pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=47)|
| 0:00:59| Next is amendments to the agenda. Commissioner Brawls is not here today, but she called and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| asked that number 906 be deferred until our next meeting, which will be next month. Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| I would like to add a quick discussion item of where we are on charter review. Mr. Leuthold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| is going to be joining us at that time. And do we have any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=75)|
| 0:01:23| Commissioner Anders. No, I'm sorry. Yes, Mr. VanVate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| not an amendment, but just filling in the blank for the benefit of the body. On item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| 20 on page 4, that should actually list as blank. It's a rental services contract. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| are four responsive bidders, and it should list Stowers Machinery and Neff Rental for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=97)|
| 0:01:46| rental services without equipment operators, and APAC Atlantic and Claiborne Hauling for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| rental services with operators. And you'll have all of that by next week. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Grant, do you have anything? Yes, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask that item 26 be deferred for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| 30 days, and then just to withdraw items 38 and 39. So noted. Commissioner Brown. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| I'd like to add a discussion item pertaining to the starting time of our zoning meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=131)|
| 0:02:26| So noted. We will do that. Any other amendments to the agenda? If not, do I hear a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| that we add what needs to be added and delete what needs to be deleted and amend what needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| to be amended? Second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. It is approved. First, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| get the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting. Do I hear a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| those? Second. Motion has been made and seconded. All those in favor say aye. Aye. It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| Without unless someone objects, I had received a phone call about the discussion item with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| regards to outlets drive, and they had said that some folks had taken off work to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| today, and they asked if they could be heard as quickly as possible. So, Mr. Turley, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| he here? Mr. Turley, if you'd come forward, we'll go ahead and hear from you now, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| we appreciate your being here. Thank you very much. I'm John Turley. I'm a county resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| I live on Lyons Bend Road. We are here. I have Mr. David Ledsinger here who has left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=193)|
| 0:03:25| work and came to visit us and talk about the outlet drive project. As you know, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| been gracious enough to fund this project, the extension of outlet drive. History will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| tell you, as you see on the south side of the interstate, what it does when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| this kind of connectivity. We have opened a, we took the outlet mall, which was a 160,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| foot facility, which had been vacant for 15 years, and we made quite an investment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| We have probably 300 small business people whose financial well-being depends on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=238)|
| 0:04:06| success of this market. The extension of outlet drive was promised to us as a late spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=246)|
| 0:04:15| arrival, late spring completion. The last six weeks there's been absolutely no activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=255)|
| 0:04:23| and we're here just to kind of give you an update and let you listen to Mr. Ledsinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| The neighbors there gave the county probably $200,000 worth of free right-of-way, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=269)|
| 0:04:38| were promised a timely road construction, a timely time date. David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| And, sir, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| David Ledsinger, Pawn Creek Road, Loudoun County, Tennessee. My family has owned the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| property that Mr. Turley is describing that we donated to Right-of-Way 150 years, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| I still have family members that live on site where the road is being connected. And we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| tried to be good partners in the thing, and the folks here from the county that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| dealt with have been top-notch, and they've done everything that they've committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| do. We feel like that we've done everything that we said we would do, and I guess we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| got elderly family members living on this half-done road, and there's health concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| and access concerns, and we would just like to see the contractor come on in and complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=336)|
| 0:05:44| the cycle and do what they say that they're going to do. It impacts the whole neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| out there, and I'm just focusing for the family, and it's impacting a number of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| in our family, and I know others out on the adjacent to the roadway. It's just hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| drive by and see nothing going on, and there's obviously things that can be done and should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| be done. And it just looks as though we're running into the weather that could be iffy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| and we're afraid that we're going to be sitting there through another winter of mud, dust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| you know, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| And we're just searching for answers why there's not more activity on the site than there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| And I just would like someone to respond to that and maybe let us know when we could expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| the road to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| And that's really all I have to say at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Great. Thank you, sir. We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Just in conclusion, I want to compliment Dwight VanDeVate and Jim Snowden and Ben White with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| They've done a super job trying to coordinate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Typical road work, and we've experienced it on the other side of the interstate that no matter what the prime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| contractor wants to do, it's always an issue of communication and cooperation with the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| And we appreciate you listening to us, and we appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Thank you. Mr. VanDeVate, could you come forward and respond, please, and let us know what the status is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| And if you'd give us, once again, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Sir, Dwight VanDeVate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| We're like Mr. Turley and Mr. Lettsinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| We're frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| We have had utility conflicts that have prevented the grading contractor from moving as quickly as we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| and certainly as they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| From a contractual standpoint, I do think the record should reflect that the project is not scheduled to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| delivered to Knox County until December 4th of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| So the prime contractor still does have a pretty decent window with which to bring the project in on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=469)|
| 0:07:57| But we have in this contract, having learned from past experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| the option to invoke liquidated damages in the amount of $810 a day for every day past December 4th that this project runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=481)|
| 0:08:10| And you can rest assured that Jim and Ben have reminded the contractor of the liquidated damages prerogative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| and that if we don't have the project done, we do intend to invoke liquidated damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| Now, the good news is we've made some progress and the utilities have made some progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| and we actually think that the grading contractor will be back on site around the 2nd of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| or they may end up not mobilizing given that it's a holiday week until the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| But they should be able to start mobilizing, we hope, July 2nd, and if not, July 9th, and start moving dirt again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| And after that, things should go pretty fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| and it should give Mr. Lettsinger and his family and the other folks up and down the road some relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| So that's sort of a snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| For technical questions, I think I'd probably prefer to let Ben answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| But he is out there every day, five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| And I think we are now right at the point where things are going to start to move again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Commissioner, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| They say we had utility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| What companies are holding us up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| I believe Charter has been a holdup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| In particular, Charter is the last holdup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| I don't necessarily know if it's fair to single them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| We've had some issues that Ben could speak to in terms of getting underground utilities moved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| But the overhead utilities charter has, I think, been the last obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Have they fulfilled their?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| They're in the process of doing so now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Dwight, would you update us at our H meeting just by letter to let us know where things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| so we can keep a status on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| And thank you all for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| I have a proposed consent agenda, which I would like to read off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| And if anyone wants to pull anything, please feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| Number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=592)|

| 0:10:06| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| And let me say, when I get through reading the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| we'll see if anyone has any questions on education consent so we can address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=610)|

| 0:11:16| For those listening, those are several of those are budget items that we approved last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| It's just approving the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| And some of these are approving contracts with the state and so forth that are procedural matters that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| So, anything, anyone like to pull anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| I don't necessarily want to pull it, but I have a question on number nine, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| Number nine, that is the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Yes, this is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Oh, by the way, if anyone has any questions about schools, now is the time to ask those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Number nine, with regards to the interpreter translator services for the schools, Superintendent McIntyre is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=710)|
| 0:12:09| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| My question here is, what is involved here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| How much are we spending a year for this type of services in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Brown, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Part of, I think, the challenge is that we have engaged these types of translation services sort of on an ad hoc basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=748)|
| 0:12:38| So, if an individual school needed them, if an individual department needed them, they sort of just procured those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| What we've attempted to do with this contract is to really set the parameters for how we do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| and what the rates are and who the contractor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| So, actually being able to have this contract in place will give us the ability to precisely answer your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=777)|
| 0:13:05| in ways that probably we wouldn't be able to in a comprehensive way today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| So, what this does is it allows us to put in place the structure for that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| and to ensure that we have a per hour dollar figure associated with these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| And then it will be up to individual schools and individual departments to work through that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| and procure the services that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| So, being able to, you know, in a centralized way, really keep track of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| and know what the full amount of the resources are that are going toward these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| Well, I guess another question would be, are we ramping up these services, and if so, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| And how much did we spend on this type of service last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Yeah, and I don't have that figure off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| And I think it would be very difficult to give you that figure with any precision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| We could try to estimate it, but I don't have a good, solid figure for you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| I don't believe we're ramping up the services as much as we are trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| that we have a comprehensive structure in place to ensure that we are paying a set amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| a competitive amount for these types of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| that we have a contractual mechanism in place to make sure that we're getting the best value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| when we procure these types of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| And I know we've worked very closely with Knox County Purchasing on this procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| I'm not sure if Mr. Holt or anyone from Purchasing wants to comment on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| But, again, I see this as a proactive measure for us to be able to put in place a contractual structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| that allows us to ensure that we're getting the best possible value for the dollars that we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| on translation services and that we have that comprehensive structure in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| We are required in some instances to provide materials to parents in their native language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| under some of the federal grants that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| We're sometimes required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| And also, in a lot of ways, it's incumbent upon us as a school system to provide information to parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=908)|
| 0:15:18| so they can be engaged in the educational life of their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| So this is the structure by which we'll do that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Well, if the federal government is mandating these, are they giving us some money to fund them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| On this program too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Well, we have obligations under Title I and Title III sometimes to provide information to parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| in ways that they'll be able to understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| We are also encouraged to do so in order to make sure that we're engaging parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| in ways that are understandable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Sometimes what you get into is a challenge if a parent is not a native English speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| the challenge that you sometimes find is that they'll come to a meeting about student discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| or about the student's grades, and the student is translating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| And that's obviously not the ideal situation to be in because then the student is able to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| well, yeah, the principal says I'm doing great, Mom, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| Obviously, that's not the situation that you want to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| So I feel like there are some requirements, but more than anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| it just makes sense as we think about engaging our parents in the educational life of our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| we want to make sure that we're doing so in a way that will allow the material to be understandable to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| that will allow the information to be accessible to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| I believe it's a relatively modest expenditure in the broad scheme of our budgetary resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| and I can certainly try to get an estimate for you of what that total is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| But this is our attempt really to, I think, get a good handle on what those expenditures look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| to make sure that we have a comprehensive structure in place to ensure that we're getting the best value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| and that we're using the resources that we have efficiently for the translation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Let me also say that I visited Lonsdale several weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| and 50%, I believe, of the students there are English as second language students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| And while we were there, they did have the interpreter there in the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| and a parent did come by that did not speak English, but the child did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| And so the interpreter was able to communicate with the administration and staff about the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| And so, you know, these are just some of the things that the schools are faced with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Is it okay to talk about items 12 and 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| I'm sure what you just said probably applies also to some of these, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| Why don't you just take 13 first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Tell me a little bit about this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| I'm assuming this was bid, went through purchasing, was bid, et cetera, this kitchen premier food equipment service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1091)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| So, yeah, and I will have to defer to Knox County Purchasing on the structure of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| My understanding is it was a bid and it is for repair and maintenance of our equipment through our food nutrition services program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1109)|
| 0:18:38| But beyond that, Commissioner, to be honest with you, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| I'm not versant in the details of it, so I'll have to defer to Knox County Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| It was competitively bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| In my understanding, John Dickle, who is the supervisor in food service over the past year or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1132)|
| 0:19:00| he's been looking for ways to employ efficiencies and possibly not hiring people and outsourcing services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| and I believe this is a product of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| And when this bid process takes place, Hugh, there's a panel that reviews the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| How is the panels, say, in this instance, how are those selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| What's the criteria for the panelists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| There would be one panelist from my office, which would be the purchasing division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| and then you would possibly have someone from schools food service and maybe someone from schools finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Mr. Norman, if I could interrupt you just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Secretary of State Trey Hargett has joined us, and I see he may be getting ready to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| I don't want you to leave without us properly recognizing you, sir, and thank you for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| and thank you for your service to our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| I'm sorry, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| I just want to make sure he was properly recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Thanks, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| I guess, okay, the other question there in terms of 204, item number 12 on our agenda, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| could you tell us just a little bit about this, I guess, as much as you can detail from, first of all, what's E-Rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1212)|
| 0:20:21| What is E-Rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| So this item, Commissioner Norman, is a fund balance designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| and federal E-Rate is a program through the federal government which basically reimburses the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| for certain technology infrastructure costs and investments that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| And it can be up to a 90% match for certain levels of school poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1245)|
| 0:20:54| It's actually based on the percentage of kids who are eligible for free and reduced lunch at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| Normally, the E-Rate applies only to a certain threshold of student poverty in a school, and I think it's around 70% or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1261)|
| 0:21:11| And on sort of a sliding scale, they'll reimburse the school system for up to, as I said, 90% of those expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| So it's a pretty good deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| There's also a one-time opportunity this spring and summer that the federal government has put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| to allow us to be reimbursed for some technology infrastructure expenditures that we might make on schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| that I think it goes down to about 50% poverty in a certain number of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| So these are schools that haven't been eligible for the E-Rate in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| and probably won't be eligible for the E-Rate in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| but we have this sort of one-time opportunity that we want to take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| And it's really the kind of unglamorous sort of back-of-the-house technology infrastructure like switches and routers and the like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1310)|
| 0:21:59| that are kind of really the infrastructure that needs to be in place for technology in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| And so we thought this would be a very opportune time for us to make an investment in those types of technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| and really begin to bring some of those schools to where they need to be in terms of technology infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| There are two other components to this fund balance designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| One is textbooks, and we're looking at English language arts and literature textbook adoptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| And then there's a small amount for vehicles for our maintenance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| We have some very high-mileage vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| We have some very aged vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| And in order to continue to do the work that our maintenance department needs to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| in making our schools safe, healthy learning environments for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| there's a designation for a small amount for vehicles in our maintenance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| Okay, I understand probably the advantage with the matching funds federally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| and possibly this one-time chance for these schools that are designated at a lower poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1381)|
| 0:23:10| But all of these, I mean, from a budgetary standpoint, all of these are what you'd classify as ongoing expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| and you're going to draw your fund balance down 6.7, almost 6.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| That's true, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| No, Commissioner, I would not characterize these as ongoing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| That's why they're as fund balance designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| They're largely one-time expenditures on a specific spend that will allow us to do either procure, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1411)|
| 0:23:41| the textbooks for this round of adoption or to invest in technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| I mean, these are designated as fund balance expenditures because they are one-time costs and not ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| Okay, but you're going to draw it down 6.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Okay, so that's almost 24% of your fund balance at $27 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1436)|
| 0:24:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| In that neighborhood, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| In that neighborhood, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| All right, that's just an interesting number, I guess, in terms of the total of your fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| Well, and, Commissioner, you may remember at the joint meeting of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| and the county commission, we talked about fund balance and where we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and the various designations that have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| And, you know, we actually talked about these specific designations moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and the school board has since approved them, and now they're before you as a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| On the subject of textbooks, where are we in terms of e-textbooks now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1480)|
| 0:24:50| You're waiting for infrastructure funding to provide in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1490)|
| 0:25:00| I mean, we're getting traditional textbooks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| These are textbooks just like we've always had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| These would be both traditional textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| But typically, when we procure hardcover textbooks and workbooks, physical textbooks now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| we also procure the electronic versions of those for some period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| And that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| And the challenge is that the economics of e-textbooks aren't quite there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| I expect that the economics of electronic textbooks will be workable in the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| But right now, the price differential really isn't that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| So one example from I think it was last year when we did mathematics, I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| I think it was a fourth grade mathematics textbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| The textbook, the physical textbook with the electronic version was roughly $57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| The electronic version itself was about $54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| So there really wasn't the kind of price differential that you would expect with regard to the printing costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| the shipping costs, the distribution, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| That price break really hasn't been seen yet in terms of our procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| But I expect that it will be shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| I expect that in the next few years it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| But as you suggest, yes, if we're going to move to electronic textbooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| we'll need to have some form of a device that our students would need to read them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| And that is certainly sort of a prerequisite for us to moving in that direction comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| And we're moving somewhat, not as quickly as you'd wish, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| but somewhat because invoices that are coming through county finance last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| in the last 18 months we've got something like $2.6 million in terms of iPods, iPads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1603)|
| 0:26:53| So we're purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Yeah, we continue to do some pilots with learning devices, technology learning devices at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| We continue to do what you might have done in the past with a traditional computer lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| There are some schools that are setting up a lab with a device rather than with a desktop computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| We've done, we obviously have moved forward at the L&N STEM Academy with iPads for all of our students there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1639)|
| 0:27:28| We've done a smaller pilot at Saramore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| And all of the fifth grade students at Pond Gap Elementary School also we've procured iPads for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1651)|
| 0:27:39| Now that was through a pretty, a good chunk of that was through a pretty generous donation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| private donation that came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| But we do continue to procure technologies that will assist with instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| but we do that right now on a sort of an ad hoc basis, school by school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| where resources are available at the school level and they're interested in making those types of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| I would like to see us move to a more comprehensive approach in the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| but at the moment we do not have the resources to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| If not, do I hear a motion that we approve the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| On page two, item number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| and to serve as directors of the Industrial Development Board in the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| and the Health, Educational and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox, Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| We do have some resumes that have come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Before I ask for a motion, Todd Napier, name and address of the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| and if you would give us the list of persons that you're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| My name is Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I work for the Development Corporation of Knox County, 17 Marcus Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| As most of you know, we also serve as staff to the Industrial Development Board of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| I'm here before you today because we have several board members whose terms are expiring, that being three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1757)|
| 0:29:26| and we've had an unusual circumstance where, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| we have two board members who need to resign their positions for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| But, nonetheless, that creates an opening in five out of 11 board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| which is significant for a board, particularly when you have a board that serves terms of six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| I did just want to mention a couple of things to remind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| The Industrial Development Board itself traditionally dealt with bond issuances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| which have not been its primary function in many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| but also deal with payment of tax applications and dealing with those leases, tax income financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1799)|
| 0:30:08| I've worked on a couple of special projects here in the last year, year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| such as Carter Elementary School with Knox County and the renovation of the Oakwood Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| So coming off of this board term, the expirations are Ed Poore, David Swanner, John Valiant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| Pat Crumley is having to resign her position, as is Jay Crippen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| We have submitted before you six names for or want to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| The nominating committee asked that we present this in two different resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| One of them is to replace the members whose terms are expiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| and then a second resolution would be to fill the unexpired terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| and that's number seven on your agenda, that being for Jay Crippen and Pat Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| So the way it has been recommended and presented to you is four names for the unexpired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| excuse me, for the terms that are expiring, that being Sam Mays, Paul Fortunato, Greg McWhorter, and Trey Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| And if I may, just may I talk about number seven, just to kind of keep it in context, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| And for number seven, it would be for Robin Askew to fill the unexpired term of Pat Crumley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| and Ed Poore to fulfill the unexpired term of Jay Crippen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| And the reason that Ed, whose term is expiring, is being asked to fill the unexpired term of one of our members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| is so that we would have a little bit of continuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| so that we wouldn't be with five brand new members who had never been through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| and understood kind of the things that would be before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| And I did want to mention that we do have several folks here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| I've got Paul Fortunato here, if you could raise your hand, Greg McWhorter, Trey Coleman, and Robin Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| And if you've got some questions of them, I'm sure they'd be happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| Their bios are in your packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| And I guess, again, to remind you, this is your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| These are just recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| So on number six, you say you recommended four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| We would select three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I know that's kind of an odd number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| There were several others that we had considered, but when they were contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| and they looked into it, decided they didn't have the time to be able to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Todd, you mentioned John Valiant and Swanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Now, are they expired terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Are you asking that they be reappointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| They are not back up for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| But the two, Robin Askew and Ed Porter, that's the ones you're recommending for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| To fulfill the unexpired terms of Pat and Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1985)|
| 0:33:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| I'm going to ask that we send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| We have some commissioners not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| But does anyone have any questions of any of the folks that are here who are up for nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Just quick, none of them served more than two consecutive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| The situation with Ed Porter would be that Ed would be going into a third term if he fit well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| He would be filling the unexpired term of a member, which would put him over the 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| So he'll have how many years total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| That would put him at 12 plus about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2023)|
| 0:33:53| It would put him at 16 years total if he served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| So you've got several other names if you don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| I speak very highly of Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Ed's done a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| And I'm not sure that all of these nominees can be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| So I didn't know if you wanted them just to introduce themselves, say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| I think it would be appropriate for them to do so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Commissioner Norman, let me see if Commissioner Norman has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Just a question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Of the guys that are the people whose terms have expired, okay, would you go over that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| Who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| So the terms that are expiring are Ed Porter, David Swanner, John Valiant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2068)|
| 0:34:39| and then the resignations are Pat Cromley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| But about the ones who expired, have they or have any of them served two terms of six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| They all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| They've all served two terms of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| And I guess if each of the individuals could come forward, give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| and just a little about yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| And we'll see if any commissioners have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| I'm Robin Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I'm an attorney at Lewis King Creek in Waldrop, which is at 620 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| And my address at home is 701 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| And I was asked to consider this, and it's something that I actually am interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| because I serve on the state board, Tennessee House of Representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| I know Secretary Hargett as well as I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| He serves on that board with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| And a lot of what I do in my practice involves TIFs and other types of financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| and this is something that I have a background in, and I'm interested in serving, if it is your desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Are you still chair of the CBID board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2161)|

| 0:36:03| Now, we have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Next week, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| You did a good job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2168)|

| 0:36:51| I've lived in Knoxville, Knox County, all of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Practiced law for about ten years until a little over ten years ago when I went into business with my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| commercial real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2221)|

| 0:37:26| and other kinds of commercial litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Served on a variety of nonprofit boards during the last 15 or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| My name is Trey Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| I live at 4125 Ridgeway Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| I'm a banker by trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Have worked mostly in the commercial real estate area doing a lot of working with TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| and a lot of economic development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| I have a master's from UT in city planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| and worked in D.C. for a few years for the Appalachian Regional Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| where I got to know a lot about economic development and a lot of water and sewer grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| and just very excited about this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Tell me, who's the one that's going to be doing the 20-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Ed is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Ed could not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Ed's traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Ed works for Strategic Supply, which used to be Scruggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| I think he's been before you maybe once or twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| So how many members on your board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| It's an 11-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| I did want to mention that Sam Mays, who is one of the co-owners of Management Solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| was not able to be here this week or next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| He's traveling, but that's the other name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| But I think we've got a fine group of folks, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| I personally want to thank them for offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Do we have a motion on item number six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| We're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| So move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| So we'll move it on without recommendation and take it up on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| A question in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Are we going to do that like we normally do one at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Well, we have four, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Up three vote counters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| We'll put all four in nomination and vote and drop off the lowest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Y'all going to bring yard signs, bumper stickers, whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Campaign chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| Item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Approving the appointments of Robin Askew to complete the unfulfilled term of Patricia Crumley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| and Ed Porter to complete the unfulfilled term of Jake Crippen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| both having recently resigned for serving as directors of the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| of the County of Knox and Health Educational Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| It's been made and seconded by Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| I was just going to make that same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| It's moved on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Chairman, let me ask Todd, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Tell us what's the difference, IDB and the Health and Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| The Health Education Housing Facility Board is primarily set up as the ability to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| tax-exempt bond financing for health care facilities, some public, you know, housing to support low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2422)|
| 0:40:32| educational facilities, obviously other than public schools or, you know, state-owned schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| Housing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| They're primarily a conduit organization for tax-exempt bond financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| But the boards are usually identical, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| They're identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| So the way those normally are run is we'll hold the Industrial Development Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| That will adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| And then we will call the Health Ed. Board to order and hold that meeting immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Item number eight is a resolution reappointing Ninto Black, District 6, Elevata, Grissom, District 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2468)|
| 0:41:18| and appointing District 5 to the Knox County Library Advisory Board Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| We do not have a name, I don't believe, for District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Commissioner Briggs is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| But we do for District 6 and District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Could we go ahead and vote on those separately without District 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| If someone wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Do you want to move with that recommendation and see if Dr. Briggs has one on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| So the motion is to move that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| On page ten, item number 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| creating a task force designed to increase Knox County's shared basic education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| BEP monies allotted by the State of Tennessee Resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| I'd like to make a motion we send that on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| I intend to bring this up at the Chairman's Lunch and have some specifics for you at that time if that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| I'll make that a form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Item 51, requesting that Knox County Purchasing Division issue a request of information from vendors qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| to conduct a comprehensive survey on behalf of the Knox County's public school teachers, Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| Again, I'd like to address this at the Chairman's Lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| But, Hugh, while you're here, if you would, we've chatted briefly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| Anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| We would be happy to assist in the development of an RFP and in the solicitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| and in contracting with a consulting company to conduct the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| And, Gray, like I say, I'm asking that we send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I intend to talk about it at length at the Chairman's Lunch next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Well, while we're here, I just wanted to know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Well, when we were talking before about the idea of how we improve education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| I brought up the idea when we were at CalHOONS of let's ask the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| Let's survey the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| So this survey would be of the teachers of Knox County to find out from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| are there roadblocks preventing them from doing the jobs that they need to do in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| Are there things that they see we need to do to improve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| I'd like to hear from the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| And let's survey every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| And let's see what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| That is a wonderful idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Well, these are really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| And so the idea would be let's put down what we're trying to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| what we hope to gain from this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I'd like to talk with KCEA about it as well over the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| But on Monday, to kind of drill it down, this specific thing is to ask purchasing to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| come back to us with an RFI, RFQ, RFP, whatever it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| and let's start looking at cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| And let's see exactly what we're trying to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| and how we're going to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| And the only thing that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| the school system in the process of this last budget war that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2656)|
| 0:44:25| supposedly the teachers were included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| But what I thought I understood was it was a very cursory attempt, at best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2669)|
| 0:44:38| to include them, some type of online survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| The anonymity of the survey was even in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| I'd like to emphasize again that teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| many teachers are in fear of their jobs and of frank and open discussion of these topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2691)|
| 0:45:00| Now, how you go about overcoming those difficulties, that's a big part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2700)|
| 0:45:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| The anonymity would have to be guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Otherwise, it's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I mean, we're interested in frank discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| and seeing what the teachers have to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Hopefully, and I think they will, be very frank and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| And I think we're going to get good data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| So the motion is to send on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| I made the motion and someone else seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Brad seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| On page 11, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Discussion regarding the farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| David Vandegrift is supposed to be here to discuss this item, and I do not see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| So could I just pass this on to our meeting on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| So it will appear on the agenda again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Are we through with the regular agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| No, I've got one other item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| I just wanted to ask something at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Well, we have two other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Discussion on the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Former Commissioner Leuthold is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| I asked him to come just as a briefing of where we are because we're getting down to deadlines in terms of getting things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| And so I just would like for you to brief us on where we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Well, thanks for the invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Craig Leuthold, 1320 Zachary Taylor Road, Chairman of the Knox County Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| I would say right now we have eight initiatives that we have approved to be put on the ballot for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2810)|
| 0:46:59| Right now we're working towards what items can we put on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| I would say some of the bigger items that we have yet to finish tackling would be the sheriff's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2825)|
| 0:47:13| We need to figure out exactly what we're going to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| We do have some suggested options that might end up on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| The other couple items I think that are big that we need to make sure we tackle is finish up what we're going to do if we're going to put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| whether to have appointed versus elected office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| And we also need to have a, I believe, finish our discussion about what is a term when we're talking about term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2853)|
| 0:47:44| I think those are some three major issues that we as a committee need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2864)|
| 0:47:53| Now, Mr. Chairman, you and I talked the other day about an item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| and I went ahead and I've asked the law department to put this on as a discussion item, is the size of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2880)|
| 0:48:11| I believe 27 members is a bit too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| I haven't come up with an actual number that I think would be better, but something smaller than 27 would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| And so I want to put it out there and see what other members think would be a better number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2902)|
| 0:48:33| We seem to have a problem with making sure we have enough members there for a quorum here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2913)|
| 0:48:41| There's been one meeting that we didn't have a quorum right at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| and it was a few minutes after before we actually had our at least 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| I think the max we've had has probably been somewhere around 22, 23 members at a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2930)|
| 0:48:59| and we've been a little bit struggling for that, and I think that's because of the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| And so I want to put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| Now, it might be something that this body, the Review Committee, may not get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| We're running out of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| The deadline to put anything on front of the people for the November ballot is, I believe, if the law department corrects me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2957)|
| 0:49:27| I think it's September the 7th or at least early September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| meaning the way we're having our meetings on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday is August the 22nd would be the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2971)|
| 0:49:43| that we're scheduled to have prior to that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| And I think there's about five or so meetings left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| So, you know, we may need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| We may have to stay longer than the two hours that we've sort of put on ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| We only go from five to seven, and if we're going to get through everything that's still left on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| I don't think that we're going to get through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| So as far as getting back to, you know, something like this, the size of this committee, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| although I believe it's important, you know, it's not something that needs to be immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| It could be something that after we discuss it, it might be something that maybe commission decides to take up afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| even after this committee is done, because the commission could vote to place something like that on the ballot in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3026)|
| 0:50:36| And it would still be in plenty of time for the eight years that we have until the next committee comes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| So I just wanted to put that stuff out there here to answer any questions that the commissioners may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| I'd ask Mr. Leuthold to come to brief us on where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| but also to say that, yes, we are running out of time in terms of trying to get something on the ballot in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| I guess the commissioners who are on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| are there items that maybe the commission needs to take up to try to put on the ballot by September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| I don't know that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| But if there is, we're looking at July and August, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Because according to our rules, we have to have two readings and there has to be a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| So perhaps we don't need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Chairman, but when is your August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| It will be the fourth Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| The fourth Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Do we know what that is, perchance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| How the calendar falls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| I guess I would still beat the September deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| But it's just that, yes, if the commission is going to put something on, you would need to make sure you act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3099)|
| 0:51:48| You know, the other thing is that for the commission to put it on, it takes a two-thirds vote as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| Twenty-seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Twenty-seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| So there would be enough time to do that if we wanted to address it in July and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| I'm not advocating anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| I'm just saying commission needs to be aware of that in case there is something that any commissioner would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| put on the ballot in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Otherwise, I think the Charter Committee is doing a good job and you've tackled some very lengthy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| I mean, issues that really needed to be vetted, and I think you've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| And, you know, we've been putting in a lot of time, a lot of effort, and I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3140)|
| 0:52:28| it's been a privilege to serve on this committee and to serve as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| But we still have a few more issues that we need to finish addressing so that we can place them on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| if this committee decides to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| And I appreciate all those that serve from commission on that body and look forward to seeing you in, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3161)|
| 0:52:51| it will be a week from Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| It will be our next committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| With regards to how it is to be written on the ballot, are you approving that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| or are you just sending it to the law director and it will be up to the law director's office to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| to do the wording and send it on to the election committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| We're writing those, Commissioner, and then we send them on to the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| Yeah, that's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| We approve what we would like to have changed or placed before the voters to see if they would like to see that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3195)|
| 0:53:24| And then the law department, it's up to their discretion to write that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| I can tell you that for the ballot initiatives for August, the law department did for me the language to read over them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3207)|
| 0:53:38| to make sure that that was what the committee had approved and that was the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| just to, I guess, double check to make sure that that's the way we wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| And they did an excellent job of writing them up, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| and I think they'll do another excellent job for anything that may come before the November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| Any questions for Mr. Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Craig, thank you for being here and thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Well, I appreciate you all and thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Discussion of the starting time for resoundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Last month we started at five because we had to be out of the room and it worked out good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| I don't see a reason why that we could not move those to five instead of six o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| That would be my suggestion that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Does that need to go to rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| You want to make a recommendation that the Rules Committee take that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| So it is a discussion item, but I think we can go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| Can we, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| So the motion is to send to rules the possibility of meeting at five o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Rules will take it up and come back to us with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| I may have could possibly could have called you about this, but in the spirit of public disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| I wanted to ask you in the among the three thousand e-mails we got from five weeks ago to two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3312)|
| 0:55:20| right in the middle of it was an e-mail from CSX Railroad concerning a siding, I think, out in Brad's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Has anything been done on that that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| They wanted $7,500 to maintain the siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| There had been one box car in there in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Actually, that goes back to about a 30-year-old agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| and currently engineering is reviewing that to see exactly what steps we want to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| I was just going to offer Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| We've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| I asked for the original enabling legislation, and I think we should be able to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| I was in that industry quite a while, and Mike could possibly get the fees waived or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| If you need my help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| We'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Any other items to come before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| If not, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| I'm sorry, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| According to the e-mail we got from the law director that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| According to the e-mail we got from our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| we need to re-discuss how the distribution was on that $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Has that been cleared up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| I want to address that at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| We want to add something to the minutes to clarify everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| But everything has been signed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| The resolution has been signed by the mayor, and we're good on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Just really a brief explanation, and Chris Caldwell can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Even if we wanted it to go to maintenance of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| maintenance of effort by law is from source income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| and so it depends on where the source is whether or not it's maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| And if we took $20 million out and gave it to them, it couldn't be maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| It has to be taxes or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| I understand that, but I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| We're going to clarify the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Clarify it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Anything else to be brought before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120618?start=3441)|
