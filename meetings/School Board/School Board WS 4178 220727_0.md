| 0:02:00| Board members, do we have any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| Do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| A motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Babb. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=131)|
| 0:02:20| So, we do have a special recognition tonight. Superintendent Thomas and Senator Massey, would you like to, do you have a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=140)|
| 0:02:38| Thank you for letting me attend this meeting to honor our former superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| Senator Briggs is not well and was not able to come today, so he sends his regards and hates that he couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=166)|
| 0:02:57| One of the things that we get to do in the legislature is do special recognition of very, very special people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=177)|
| 0:03:07| Of course, our role in working with Knox County Schools, we've worked with you all closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| I think we have a great relationship between our Knox County delegation and the Knox County Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| Congratulations, John, on being the new superintendent. I haven't had a chance to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| I think we're together tomorrow night at a leadership Knoxville event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| So, anyway, but I do have a proclamation from the Tennessee Senate, and I'm not going to read all the whereases, but I might read a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=207)|
| 0:03:38| So, you know, whereas Mr. Thomas has focused on three priorities as superintendents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| enhancing student achievement, creating a positive culture, and eliminating disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| Those priorities became the foundation of a new five-year strategic plan that was adopted by the Board of Education in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=231)|
| 0:04:00| It goes on and talks about where he went to the university, the best university in the country, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| Then he has devoted his entire professional career and service to education in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| beginning in 1973 as a teacher at Bearden Junior High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| His tenure as superintendent at Knox County Schools has implemented multiple salary increases for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| completed construction of Gibbs Middle School and Hardin Valley Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| and implemented a one-to-one initiative that provided a laptop computer to every K-12 student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| And Mr. Thomas navigated complex issues related to COVID-19 as Tennessee schools cut short the 2019-20 academic year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=279)|
| 0:04:49| Superintendent Thomas and Knox County Schools developed a detailed reopening plan for 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| including extensive health and safety protocols for in-person students and a new online learning program for virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| The district reopened in August 2020 and offered the option of in-person instruction or virtual instruction for the entire academic year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=304)|
| 0:05:14| Whereas his many professional accomplishments aside, Bob Thomas is most grateful for the love and companionship he shares with his wife, Becky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=314)|
| 0:05:23| who is a teacher at Central High School. He is the proud father of son, Brandon, and his wife, Annalise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| And throughout his esteemed new career, Mr. Thomas has demonstrated the utmost professionalism, ability and integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| winning the unbridled respect and admiration of the students, parents, teachers and school board members of Knox County Schools alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=337)|
| 0:05:46| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate of the 112th General Assembly of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| the House of Representatives concurring, that we extend to Bob Thomas our heartfelt wishes for a happy and fulfilling retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| applaud his dedication to the youth of Tennessee and wish him much happiness and every continued success in his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=360)|

| 0:06:28| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=388)|
| 0:06:43| First, I'd like to say, well, good afternoon, everybody. It's great to see everyone. It's so different being on this side of the table than the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=403)|

| 0:06:57| I just want to thank Senator Massey and Senator Briggs and the legislature for this resolution, something I didn't expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=417)|
| 0:07:06| I'm usually on the other end of giving awards, not receiving awards, so it's kind of awkward for me, but thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| And I'll tell you what, our legislative delegation is the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| And Senator Massey and Senator Briggs and our representatives have just unwavering support for Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| and also for all the school systems, public school systems across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| And I just want to thank you for your service and all the legislators for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| It means so much to us and I know to our board, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| And it's just been an honor and a privilege and a pleasure to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| I appreciate so much y'all giving me this opportunity that I've had for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| And although we went through some difficult times with COVID and those kinds of things, hey, we made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=471)|
| 0:07:59| I'm just so proud. By the way, the university, I encountered nobody dumb at the university, I wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| In all my classes I've taken over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| And also, I just want to brag on our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| I know before the pandemic, we weren't where we wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| We were getting better, making progress, but the pandemic sort of put a stop to everything and we lost a lot of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| But I tell you what, our teachers, I read it in the paper, and of course, Dr. Riesbeck texted me too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| but just said, hey, this year, the test results, our kids are almost back to pre-pandemic levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| That just tells me that I know we have great teachers, I knew we had great teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| but that's proof that we have great teachers, that they've worked so hard this past year to get our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| and our principals, to get our students back to that point where hopefully they're ready to take off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| and even learn more and do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| And I just want to say across the board, these things that Senator Massey, I had nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| All the people I worked with, I had an amazing team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Dr. Riesbeck on that team, and Renee Kelly, and Carly Harrington, and Ron McPherson, and Russ Oaks on that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| they were just amazing and helped us to do so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| And I just appreciate them putting up with me, because they did, and did so very graciously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| And I appreciate our executive team that I worked with, which I won't go through all the names on our executive team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| but just to say there's so many great and wonderful people that work for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| And we're, our community is so fortunate, and I think all of our folks, our teachers, our principals are the greatest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| And, by the way, Becky, come up here, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Stand with me, you weren't supposed to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Those of you that hadn't met Becky, my wife Becky, and she taught choral music 42 and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=587)|

| 0:10:01| And she's my biggest, number one supporter, and a motivator for me, and my incentive, and just love her to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=601)|
| 0:10:10| And this is just so nice, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| Again, I don't know how to do this kind of stuff, because I'm not usually on this end of the awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| So, and I want to, just our students and our families, just to say thank you to them for the opportunity to serve as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=620)|
| 0:10:29| So, just God bless you all. I wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| And I also want to thank God for my opportunity that was given to me to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=633)|

| 0:10:46| You've heard enough of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| I would say it's a well-deserved award, and you have done a remarkable job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| And thank you for sharing him with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| I know that that probably wasn't always easy, especially over the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| But can we get a photo with Senator Massey and you and Ms. Thomas and the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=662)|

| 0:14:36| So we'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Speaking of Lonsdale, just want to make sure everybody knows that it will now be one school that is a pre-K through fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| And we've had Lonsdale and Sammy Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| They're going to be combined into one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And we really appreciate the board's support on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| I know the community is excited about that, and a lot of work has gone into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Both mayors, both the county and city may have been supportive of that, as well, and will be participating and moving forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| We're excited to see the students there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| I think it's long-deserved for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| I'm glad to see that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| So Monday, August 1st at 10 a.m. will be that ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| I think we've got that information out for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| And I believe there will be tours then, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| So we'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| I also want to speak to the new teacher academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| We had the first one of those today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| I was able to go out with Dr. Wilson and a lot of our staff and address the elementary teachers there at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| A great bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| You know, our HR team has done a really good job of hiring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| We're kind of tracking those numbers, and right now we're ahead of where we were last year as far as fewer vacancies at this time than we had at this point last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=934)|
| 0:15:43| So they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| But just the quality of folks that we saw and got to meet there, very excited about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| really stressing just the relationship with students and relationships with the community, and just glad they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| We thank them because we know, especially in this time of teacher shortages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| people can take their talents and gifts to lots of places, and they're choosing to be in Knox County, which we think is the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| And we are very grateful for them to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Tomorrow we get to go do the same for the secondary folks at Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| So we'll be doing the same there and excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| And then the last thing I'll say is I know we've talked a lot about the 865 Academy work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Tomorrow and Friday there will be training for the freshman academies that launch this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| Those full teams will be in meeting, and Ms. Jackson will be leading that training for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| So with that, that concludes my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Mr. Bolton, I believe you have an update presentation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=996)|
| 0:17:04| I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the Tennessee Educators of Color Alliance, TECA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| And one of the things I want to focus on and talk about is draw us back to what the work is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| and talking about that our priority when we're looking at, and this is the superintendent's priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| and some of the belief statements that we're doing and that we can all buy into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| but we believe that all students, all students should be instructed by great teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| I think that is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| And we also believe that students should be staffed with diverse educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| that mirror the demographics of the student population, that great teachers deserve to be celebrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| that teachers should be compensated well for their professional service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| and that all teachers should have access to high-quality support and the resources that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| and all teachers and leaders should have access to strong professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| credentialing opportunities, and leadership for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| And then all schools should be led by great leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| And I say that because that needs to be the work that drives us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| And with that being said, I want to talk to you about what the TECA fellowship is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| TECA was actually an initiative that was funded and really facilitated by Knox Ed Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| There was limited touch points in the district when we're talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| in terms of selecting the participants of the fellowship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| That selection was determined by TECA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| We provided a level of support in terms of identifying the folks that were educators of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| and making them aware of that opportunity for the TECA fellowship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| And each year, that original application was sent in March of each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| and it closed in April, and then the selection was made by the TECA folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| in terms of who was selected for that fellowship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| The future of the TECA fellowship, I think, and I put this up here because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| as you all know, hopefully soon you all will get an announcement for who is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| the executive director of talent acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| And things, initiatives such as this, this is where those kind of initiatives would live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| So I say this, I don't want to speak for our future person in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| in terms of what the future of the TECA fellowship is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| I think that's something for those folks to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| So what is the total cost for 15 fellows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| It was about $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| 100% of that was paid by KEF in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| In year two, there was a budget allocated amount of $30,000 for the second cohort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| which was in this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| What did the folks in the group, what did they experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| They had alternating Saturday sessions and weekday evening sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| It amounted to about one session per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| They did book studies, books that they chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| They were matched to mentors in terms of their professional and personal interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| Each of those folks were given a $1,200 stipend for that additional connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| and professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| I want to pause to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| The time that they experienced doing this professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| cannot count towards their professional development requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| because they were compensated for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| And that's something I just want to draw your attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Each teacher has to do professional development opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| And if you're being compensated for those professional development opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| you can't count that towards your requirements for your contract time, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| So these folks were compensated by the TECA at that stipend amount of $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| And then the facilitator had office hours for additional support as far as one-on-ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| and talking to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| This list of folks, a great list of folks, were our 20, 21, 22 TECA fellows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| There were 12 in this inaugural class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| And you'll see that a good mix of schools across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| that's represented in that list of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| The vision of TECA is that it's a year-long experience designed to inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| and empower local professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| And it provides those skills for the purpose of networking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| opportunities for growth, experience, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| and other teachers of color through six months hands-on curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| and four additional months of independent guided study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| We talk about those with the book studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| This is the curriculum in the six sessions that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| This would be the concepts that they covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| And I can't speak to what was in the sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| It wasn't in the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| It was something that TECA and the cohort members spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| Now, I'm going to close with these are the TECA fellows for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| And you'll see that the numbers have increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| I think we've got rounds out at 14 for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Again, you'll see a good broad range of different schools that are selected here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| and represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| So that kind of concludes my report regarding the TECA and the TECA fellows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| And I'll be happy to answer any questions, should you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Yes, I guess, I mean, obviously we want a diverse workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| Is the goal of this to retain, I mean, to the fact that we're recognizing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| and we're feeding into them and that we want to retain them in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| I mean, is that the ultimate goal on this, that they want to become, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| life, you know, employees for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| And I guess what, I saw the vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| but I really don't know what the end goal is for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| That would be the end goal initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| And I think it's getting that buy-in from the folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| getting that connection with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| I think the initial purpose of looking at this was for the purpose of the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| of our educators of color and providing that level of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| And go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| And so after one year of this, did we get feedback from them that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| I mean, I'm hoping they felt like it was a positive experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| and worth their while to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| And, I mean, what was the feedback we've gotten from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| As far as feedback, we did not get feedback directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| So the feedback came through the cohort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| and we have not had conversations with TECA regarding the conclusion of cohort 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| or cohort 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| And as that one cohort closed to the other closed, we're, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| this is going to reside in a different area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| So we've not engaged in those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| And that's why we've left it open-ended, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| for the person that comes into that position as to whether this will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| continued in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Just one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I guess, you know, I mean, I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| And, I mean, obviously we want to retain our best teachers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| But I think it would be great if we can learn from them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| this was great, but, or this was great, continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| You know, I mean, so I think it would be whoever is continuing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| to get feedback from the people that have already gone through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| to just even make it better as we're going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| which is obviously what we're wanting is to keep these people in our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| and hopefully get them to bring their friends into our system too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| And I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| I spoke to a number of those folks just to, if I was going to speak about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I want to kind of talk to a few before I spoke about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| They really enjoyed the program, felt like they took a lot from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| But as far as a formalized report, then I would probably defer to TEC on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I'll add to that just a little bit, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Our Executive Director of Talent Acquisition we anticipate announcing this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| So this is something that the Executive Director of Talent Acquisition will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| that it will live with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| but that is also one of the priorities that will be evaluating the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| positives of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| how we can use that information to benefit our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| but also to increase retention and ensure retention of our high-quality educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I had similar questions just about the follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| and it sounds like we're going to get those as we have a new Director of Talent Acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| The one question I have actually doesn't have to do with this exact presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| When the agenda came out and it said Tennessee Educators of Color Alliance TECA report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| I assumed it was going to be a different report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| So there was a, Nathan Langlois did some work with TECA last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| to basically do an audit of the perspectives of our teachers of color and others across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| And I know KEF funded that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| My assumption was that was going to be the report that we got tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I know he gave that presentation to the Alliance for Educational Equity Steering Committee a few months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| And I would like for some point the board to have access to that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I know it was funded by KEF, and I don't know if they have some kind of embargo on that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| but I would love to see the board have access to that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Because I think it's important as we're thinking about this particular priority of creating a more diverse workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| understanding what the current perspectives are of our educators of color in our district I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| And that was, I know, work that we initiated, although we didn't fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| Yeah, and I actually had a conversation with Dr. Roslick about this earlier this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| and I think he can speak to that and how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| So I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Knox Ed Foundation did that report, and we have talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| Obviously they're going through some leadership changes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| so we talked to Mr. Askew and also to some other members of the team who weren't able to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| And I think we didn't feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| I'm not positive how public that report is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| But we'd be happy to follow up with them and either have them come and speak to that or share that with the board if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| But, yeah, we did have a conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| They just weren't able to come to be part of that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| I'm not upset at the report that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I'm glad we got this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| I'm hoping that at some point we're able to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| and certainly understand the leadership transitions there and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| but just wanted to put a pin in it and see what we can do to make that available at some point to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1661)|
| 0:27:50| And I believe that that was what prevented that other piece from being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| so we can do a follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| So any more discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| So moving on, we also added the discussion of the class membership to this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1687)|
| 0:28:16| This is something that I had asked to have added just because the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| I don't know, board members, if you recall, when we discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| it was at the end of the year, and the timing of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| it ended up being where it wasn't really beneficial for us to debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| whether we wanted to participate that year or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| and we had had the discussion that that is probably better addressed this time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| And I don't know, Gary, do you have anything you want to add to that as far as the timing of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| Yes, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| So, yes, the timing discussion was about, and when I looked at the board agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| and the basic agreement, it talks about an agreement from January to December 31st, a calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| But then if you look at the bylaws of class, and I do recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| I think we talked about that last time as well when this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| that if this board did want to make a change from class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| that that would need to be done by November 1st of the given year to avoid fees for the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| So that's what that is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| So that was the purpose of adding it to this quarterly workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| and it's certainly not something that we have to decide this month or even next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| but I do think it's something that we need to be thinking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| so that we're not caught off guard like we were when that discussion came up the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| So, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I'm going to ask Ms. Horne to help me with my memory on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| When we had our meeting with class back in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| we also had a discussion about this with all of the class members who were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| and the general consensus seemed to be that we felt that it was a little bit unfair to be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1809)|
| 0:30:18| whether to retain someone when we had not given them any job expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| And we talked about coming back to our individual boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| and discussing those expectations with our boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| and I was thinking that we had at some point also discussed doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| maybe at our September work session, our lengthy work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| so that as an individual board as well as as a member of class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| we could set out those expectations for them so that they know exactly what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| Because they've had some very conflicting expectations in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| One example would be they used to give us a very lengthy report of bills that did not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| and some folks said, why are we hearing about bills that didn't pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| We don't want to know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Well, then recently people said, why don't they ever tell us about bills that don't pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| So my recollection is that the consensus from that larger group of all of us who are class members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1873)|
| 0:31:22| was that we felt that we needed to get together and create some very clear expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| and communicate those with our class partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Is that, if I left things out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| I think that sounds like a pretty accurate description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| and I think that that was the consensus from us as well as the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| And I think that we need to, as a board, decide what we expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| so that we can communicate that to the other members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| Because the difficult thing is that this is the kind of thing that nobody really wants to jump in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| and take ownership of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| And so I think we definitely need to, we may need to lead the way on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| but I think we certainly need to figure out as a board what we expect for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| the timing that we want them to report, and what we want that to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Because in the past, I think we've just, and that's what the other boards expressed also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| we've just let them come to us and tell us whatever they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| but we haven't given them any direction on what we feel like we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| They take a lot of direction in our Friday meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| and whatever we have in our agenda, whatever we have said are our legislative priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| they take a lot of direction from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| So if our priorities and the priorities of the other boards have a place where they don't match up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| then they don't mess with that, they don't represent us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| The places where we are all having consensus is where they represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| So that's a large place where they get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Then, of course, sometimes things come up that we don't have an opportunity to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| before they have to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| And so in those instances, they generally call our staff to see if there's a way that they feel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1989)|
| 0:33:18| is this a concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| They still can't go in and say our boards don't want this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| but they can find out what are the concerns, and they can take those concerns to legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| So that's one way that they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Part of the problem with no one taking the lead, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| is because as time has passed since that organization was formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| we have sort of forgotten that the lead passes from district to district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| And so that has become a bit of a passive thing also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| So I don't know, maybe as a group we need to make that clearer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| and ask whoever has the lead at the time to maybe reach out a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| I think that's true, and I think that's kind of the consensus of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| is more on the boards, that the boards really felt kind of an ownership on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| that we're the ones who are not doing a very good job of whoever's turn it is actually leading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| because I don't think we've done a good job when it was our turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| And I think that's the consensus for everybody in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| I was also at that meeting, whenever it was, March or whenever that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| The one thing that I remember in addition to that is we were going to go back to our own boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| but then be prepared to have a joint conversation when we gather again at TSBA's conference in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| So that way each board can go off and do their own work and then come back together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| and try to build consensus, I think was the important piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| And I know one of the other things that led to that conversation is we had some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| about whether or not class is the right representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| And I'm not trying to open up that can of worms again, but we did have that conversation back in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| And you all correct me if I'm wrong, but my recollection of that is it seemed like that group as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| felt good about class, but that we need to better structure the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| and have some more formality and expectations like you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| But class left the room and we met for another, I don't know how long it was, 35, 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| And through that conversation, I didn't get a sense that the group as a whole felt like we need to look somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| It was more about redefining that relationship and those expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| And so I think we need to probably honor that, but I think we also need to probably remind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| I don't know how we do that, but we need to probably send out notification to all the other boards that are in class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| to say, hey, don't forget, we want to come to TSBA prepared and just kind of give a little nudge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| in case other boards aren't having this meeting like we are having a discussion about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| so we can have a really robust conversation at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| I can do that if that's acceptable to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| I think that makes sense that you're on those class calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| I'm not trying to speak for all of us, but most of us don't speak to the other boards on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| but you do with those class calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| So to me it makes sense to remind everybody of what we talked about and to what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| I'd also just make a little technical correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Class is technically the group of all of us, of the boards, and the folks we have representing us are Millsapsgallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| So they are part of us when we are a whole, but Millsapsgallon is the representative we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2201)|
| 0:36:50| Did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| And I'm trying to remember, was it the three of us and Susan, are we the Nashville group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Did anybody else take part in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I'm thinking it was the four of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| But one thing, I do think the discussion we had was a very good discussion, even amongst our board before we had that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| because I do think we've been way too passive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I mean, we just have, we haven't asked for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I think that discussion made us realize we're sort of at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| But what it made me do was really reach out to our legislators and ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| and I'm really bringing this up because I will not be part of the September discussions that go on about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| so I kind of want to put my two cents in about it, is pretty much every legislator I spoke to said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| they would not have any knowledge about some of the issues they have if it was not for our representation over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2252)|
| 0:37:40| And we all know that there are a lot of lobbyists on the other side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| But really, most of them, I mean, totally knew who was representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| They knew why they were representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| They felt like they got a lot of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| And so I feel like from that standpoint, they're doing the job that they're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| I think, once again, as we kind of keep on saying, we've sort of been lax about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| And I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I sort of noticed this year, and I know I ended up getting on the e-mails on the Friday e-mails and stuff with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| Has everybody been getting those, or just Jennifer and I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| I added you to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| We can't all be on there because it would be deliberative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Well, no, but I'm wondering, I mean, can it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Because I have to say, with me being on it, I felt way more informed not to have it as a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| but is there anything wrong with everybody receiving it from them, just each board member, that information that they sent out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| Because I think that makes you realize it kept me way more informed than I was in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| And I feel like with our board not getting it, they feel like there's this group out there they don't ever hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| until they come and give us this report, whereas you and I were getting Friday information from them all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| and then you're even on calls that I'm not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Well, the Friday information is also the link to the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| So we would have to be very careful about not having the two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| When I asked to add you to the call, I asked Robert to make sure that we were never both on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| So I guess maybe that might be just a suggestion of an ask of there needs to be an additional email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| one to y'all and another just informational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| But I think the fact if all the board members got the kind of legislative information they're sending out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| maybe it's even a recap on Monday after they've talked to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| I don't know how, but I think that's a little bit of the miss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| because I did feel much more informed by them this year because I was getting those emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| So I think that's a discussion we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| But I don't know how to go about doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| I obviously don't want to get in any trouble on communicating or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| I can pull out the piece that has the invitation to the call and just send the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| I just think that would help, and I think it makes you realize what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| I think the problem is, and once again, I'm not disagreeing with some people that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| I mean, when they come and speak to us, it is a little boring and dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I mean, I think maybe we could direct them a little bit more on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| maybe it needs to be more conversational or something, you know, more of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| It's just kind of data they give us or, you know, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| But once again, I think that's on us, and I think that's a discussion for this board to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| and then to have it further with the other class members and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| But I personally think they add value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| and I did like hearing when I asked the legislators that I asked that they found value in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| Ms. Sullivan, do you know who currently has the lead or what that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| I think it's national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| And then it just rotates each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Terry, is it every year or every other year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| It's every four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| My understanding about that switching districts is that that's mostly the administrative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| So every four years I'll take over all the administration, make sure the checks get paid and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| But I don't know, like, when it first started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| I think that was the intent that whoever the district was with the administrative duties for that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| that board chair would kind of take the lead with all the other boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| and make sure those communications went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| And nobody on this current board was with that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| and so in that absence of that piece kind of transferring over, it just kind of stops happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| And I would add to that that there was a different group representing class then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| and I think that may have happened in that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I just have a comment and then a question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| It sounds like the people over there are all in favor of keeping or maintaining the relationship with class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2503)|
| 0:41:57| because you were talking about, well, Mr. Dufresne, it would need to decide by November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2517)|
| 0:42:06| And I think Mr. Watson mentioned the board meeting in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2526)|
| 0:42:17| But is this something that we should discuss and deal with it maybe in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2537)|
| 0:42:31| before, as far as a yea or nay, before the new people come on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2551)|
| 0:42:43| I'm just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| I mean, I don't know how much knowledge they would have and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| I personally haven't seen a whole lot out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| It's like Ms. Babb said, it's been pretty dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And I think maybe from what I've seen and heard, they maybe cater more toward a couple of the systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2581)|
| 0:43:14| that are larger than we are and west of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Did I hear you say that it rotates every four years or that was the original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| was like one system would do it for four years and then it would rotate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| So when class first started, it was actually five districts because Memphis City Schools and Shelby were two systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| And so it would actually rotate every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| But then when it went to the four districts and Shelby combined, it comes every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| So I believe our next year to run the administrative side of it is 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| I think I can add to that just by looking at the bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| So this year, 22-23, the chair would be Hamilton County, vice chair would be Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| Next year, chair would be Knox, vice chair would be Shelby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| I just wanted to add that, well, one question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| Did we talk about when we met in February about Rutherford County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| Did that come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| I don't remember exactly what the conversation was, but does anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| I don't think we decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| I think the feeling at the time that we got feedback from was that they were not that interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| I couldn't remember what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| I know one of their board members had said to me they were curious about talking to other large districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| but it wasn't necessarily relative to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| And we had some discussion about that, and I think what we vaguely discussed was maybe just having that meeting separate from class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| and just making it informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| I think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| And asking TSBA to help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| I believe you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| I think if we can stick to the timeline from our last class meeting and locally set our expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2712)|
| 0:45:21| and then as a class group set larger expectations in November, that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| Ms. Bounds, were you thinking maybe it should switch more often than every four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| I wonder if we should look at making a change to those bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| That's kind of where I was going on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| I just think we've been kind of unaware of maybe the responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| and it's easy to do when boards change, you know, and our board changes quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| and that information sometimes is not historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| And I'll tell everybody, I went back and just started reading the minutes from that time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| so I could understand what was going on or at least try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| And it looked to me from all the documentation that I pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| that that sort of became lost when they changed who was running it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| because not that it was set out in the bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| but I think what was happening was that it was the representatives who were running it instead of the boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2787)|
| 0:46:37| And I think that's why they changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I can't really tell, but that's the impression I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| So I think all of that kind of rolled in there and caused that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| But I think I saw where you were going with that because it seems that if it rotated more often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| we would be both more aware of it, and if someone dropped the ball, someone would pick it up more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| And to Mr. McMillan, I will tell you that they don't cater just to one district or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| If all four of us don't agree, they don't carry that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| They don't go to our legislators and say this is what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| There are some lobbyists who are in Nashville and who are in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| Their lobbyists do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Each of their lobbyists works specifically for their school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| But our lobbyists for class, they are very careful to ask us on those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| and make sure that they have an understanding of exactly where we're coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| because if we don't all four agree on it, they can't say that we all four agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| So they're real careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| So do you have any idea of how many things in the past years that we have agreed on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2874)|
| 0:48:04| I mean, a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| I can't give you a number, but if we laid out each of our legislative priorities side by side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| which is one of the things that they do, and looked at those, I'm sure we see many that we agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| I can say that from the calls I've been on, all four districts were very concerned about funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| for school nurse positions, for social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| They were very concerned about teacher retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| All four districts were very concerned about funding for security initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| Well, you're just naming things that are common sense that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| whether it was a large district or not so large, I think they would all be concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2928)|
| 0:48:57| I agree, but the things I named were things that we specifically discussed on the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| that our lobbyists specifically went to our legislators to advocate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| And I can go back and look at my notes and pull some very specifics if you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| if you want it more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I just wondered how many things, you know, as far as did we agree on, you know, two dozen things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2953)|
| 0:49:22| And then, of course, there are many things that they can't work on because we don't have a position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| So if we haven't taken a position and if none of us have a position on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| then they can't look at that really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| So that's tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Like the funding formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| None of us had a position on the funding formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| So they could look at things that we had taken positions on that were part of the funding formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| but they couldn't take a position that we liked or didn't like having a new funding formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Just to be clear, Mr. Dupler, it sounds like the chairmanship of it rotates every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| Is that what you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| But is it also then that, Terry, the administrative part is every four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| Are we talking about two different things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| It sounds to me like, and from the discussion this board had last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| like Ms. Owens talking about and this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| it sounds to me like that each board in this association has now a class representative on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3024)|
| 0:50:34| and it seems like that's what's happening and then those class representatives are getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| and then maybe they're not rotating but every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| But if you go back to the bylaws and if this board wants to take the lead on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| and insist upon going back to what the bylaws say, the bylaws say exactly what you're saying, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| is that the leadership of class should rotate every school year and it started in 13-14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3057)|
| 0:51:06| and for this upcoming school year, 22-23, Hamilton County is the chair and the vice chair is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3066)|
| 0:51:14| So whoever the vice chair is in September, then this board could then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3074)|
| 0:51:22| hey, we want our vice chair to be the vice chair of class and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| So the bylaws are not specific about who on the board is the vice chair of class at that given point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| That's something for each board to decide who that vice chair or chair may be in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| I was thinking it said the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| That's, I mean, you know, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I mean, you know, so it talks about the offices of chair and vice chair for class but then it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3103)|
| 0:51:53| but then when it starts talking about each year, it then lists like first up was chair, Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| vice chair, Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| So it's not clear as to whether or not they're saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| so the actual chair of the board of Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| But that's certainly what one could apply there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Yeah, both interpretations could be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| But we don't know what's happened in practice necessarily, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Well, I mean, I think Ms. Owen has been explaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| It sounds like maybe the chair and the vice chair of each board hasn't gotten involved so much as just a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| The representatives don't rotate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| That's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| That's just the person who's on that Friday call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| So the chair and vice chair part, my understanding is that it is the board chair from each one that that should rotate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3158)|
| 0:52:50| I think that's in documentation somewhere, so I'll go dig that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| But, yeah, as the representative to class, none of those people have like chair or vice chair kind of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3173)|
| 0:53:04| They're just there to say, yes, this is what we've agreed and take that back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| So it would be helpful if we could get some clarification on that at least before we move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3191)|
| 0:53:22| I would say it might even be good in November for us to just all hash it out and say what we want and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Well, it's kind of sounding like maybe it needs to be a discussion on the yearly workshop where we can set some more time aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3209)|
| 0:53:41| and maybe everybody can come with some specific ideas of the way they would like to see communication shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3221)|
| 0:53:55| And that might be where one of the disconnects is, because if you are not on those calls or emails, you might not, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3235)|
| 0:54:04| and if you miss, you know, you can't go to TSBA for some reason, then maybe you are seeing them once a year here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3244)|
| 0:54:14| And then the next thing you know, you're voting on a contract form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| So maybe if we can figure out a way to at least update or share communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3257)|
| 0:54:26| But it does sound like we need a longer discussion maybe at the, would everyone agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Well, I don't guess I can ask that, can I, Gary? Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Ms. Horn, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| I just wanted to say that I think the big thing that we need to remember is that there are very few people advocating for public education in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| There's TSBA, there's CLAS, there's, is it the Memphis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Shelby County has their own personal, and that's it, right? Is there one more? There's one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| We also have TEA and TAUS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| TEA and TAUS. So, I mean, that's really very few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| So I think that's the big picture that we need to keep in mind is that any kind of, anybody advocating for public education is going to be positive for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3304)|
| 0:55:16| So I think that's just really important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Yeah, I think I would agree with going in this kind of response to Mr. McMillan of having this discussion, a longer discussion at the board workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3322)|
| 0:55:32| But I do go back to the fact of, and once again, it's like you just, we're a non-person board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| and there are like four of us that went to this Nashville and had this very robust discussion about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| And pretty much there was agreement among all the areas that we have not been going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| It's on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| We have got to tell our lobbyists what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| They can't just guess what we expect of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| And so that's what we have got to do as a group at our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| We've got to decide what our expectations are for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Because what happens is, like Mr. McMillan, like you've only heard them at the one meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Yeah, it's boring as can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| I'll agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| I mean, you know, but, you know, also I've gone to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| I've heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| I didn't go to TSBA this last year, so I didn't hear them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| But then that helped me when I got the Friday email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So I heard more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| So I do think we've got to figure out how, whether it's McGowan, Millsaps, or it's another group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3381)|
| 0:56:31| I really do think it would be a problem for us not to have some kind of lobbyist on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| I mean, I think that would be a big mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| Whether it's them or not, I think it's up to us to set the expectations of what we expect from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| give them a year to try to live up to those expectations, and then we have something to judge it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| But right now we're going, oh, you gave a boring report once a year and we think they're doing a bad job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| I don't think that's a fair assessment of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| So that would be my hope for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Once again, this is not, you know, by the time the workshop comes, I won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| But this is my opinion, that I would like us to set expectations, work with the rest of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| set clear expectations on what we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| So them or whatever lobbyist that we hire, but I really think, as Susan has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| I think it's very important for us to be represented by somebody over in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| I just don't, I think we're hearing too much where there are these outside parties that come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| and they're whining and dining, these legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| We all know what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| And, you know, I think we need somebody out there really looking out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| So any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| So, Ms. Owen, do you think you could get maybe some clarity on that as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| and Ms. Coatney, if we could add a discussion to our yearly workshop on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| and then everybody can maybe be preparing ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| and thinking about ideas of how they would like to see those communications shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| or if they have ideas, you know, whether it is this lobbyist or someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3483)|
| 0:58:12| and just be prepared to have that discussion so that we can develop a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| before we're faced with this contract again or before we go to TSBA in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3498)|
| 0:58:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| So if nothing else on that, I believe we have a facilities update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| Dr. Adams, is that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| And welcome back to Knox County, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| I missed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3529)|
| 0:59:07| So I have exciting news to share with everyone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Before I get started, I would like to acknowledge that my clicker is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3550)|
| 0:59:25| So before I jump in, I would like to acknowledge Mr. Shoffer, Doug Shoffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| I don't know if you all know Doug Shoffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| He's our Director of Facilities and Operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| And I will tell you, when I first took the position on July the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| which feels like that was last year, he had a board of a list of items that we had to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| And then I looked at that and I was overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Can we get this done in a month's time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| And then he said, I'm going on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| He left me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| So he's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| He said that he would leave when I got to slide one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| So if you see him trying to sneak out, please grab him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| So right now where we are, I've got, once again, exciting news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| We did get a Certificate of Occupancy, and that was last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| It came down to the wire, whether we were going to get that or not, for Lonsdale Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| So very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| You know, Doug and I, we talk in timeline now because we want to be very transparent with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| We want to be transparent with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| We certainly want to be transparent with the principal and the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| And so moving forward, we look at getting the rest of that Certificate of Occupancy in late August or early July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3627)|
| 1:00:37| Keep in mind, we're not at capacity, so we're in good shape there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| Lonsdale Elementary and Sam E. Hill will move in at the beginning of the school year, so we're set to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| Of course, as soon as they move out, the contractor will start their Phase 2 work as far as demolition, abatement, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3648)|
| 1:00:57| Teachers have started to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| If you know teachers, they'll start moving in when they're not on contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| We've just got exceptional teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| I can say that as a former Knox County teacher and as an administrator in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| it doesn't surprise me at all that they've jumped the gun and started to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| So we've started that process, and I'm excited to see everyone at the ribbon-cutting on Monday, August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| So we're moving right along for Lonsdale Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| Agent Burnett, we expect the issuance of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| I'm going to just call it a CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| We expect the CO in early September, the start of the school year, and the existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| So we will transition during fall break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| We do anticipate some degree of difficulty, possibly, in the areas of the gym, the cafeteria, and some of the restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3701)|
| 1:01:51| What we have done is we've asked the contractors to prioritize the restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| And Brett, she's amazing in our food service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| What they're looking at doing is getting the food over, getting the food prepared and bringing it over if we have to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| But keep in mind, we're looking at getting in the building and transitioning in fall break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| I always look for a plan B if I have to, and that will be plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| So I don't want anyone to be worried about, well, what if it gets delayed because of flooring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| So we're in good shape there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| And once again, once we start that process, they'll start demolition and abatement and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| The Northwest sector, we look to start in early to mid-June, and we will be open on August the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| The discussions of zoning is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| So I gave you all, I'll show you in just a second in the next slide, an idea of the areas that that will be covering and looking at who will be attending that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3767)|
| 1:02:59| I will say we met with Mayor Jacobs and his team, and they have been very accommodating, very supportive, looking at widening the Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3779)|
| 1:03:08| So excited about the community having that road taken care of and their commitment to the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3788)|
| 1:03:16| So these are the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| Once again, you see a circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| You do not see the outline of the zoning because we are not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| But these are the areas that we'll be targeting for the new Northwest sector elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| And I'll just say it out loud for the viewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Birkfield Heights, Wexford Downs, Greenbrook, Creek Bend Farms, Reagan Landing, Beaver Creek, and Clinch River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3815)|
| 1:03:45| And last but not least, the request for approval to purchase the property is on the school board for the August agenda, so that will be coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3825)|
| 1:03:55| So very excited about the Farragut Primary Grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| It is not a solution yet, but it will be once we break ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| And so we're looking at the KCF Facilities Department is developing a request for qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| And so it's an RFQ, and that should be issued as early as August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| Once again, timelines, we want to be very considerate of the board and to ensure that you all have timelines as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| I know I went through that fairly quickly, but if you all have any questions, feel free to ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3863)|
| 1:04:32| Yeah, I'm just going to bring up a zoning issue that I hope really gets considered because I see it a lot in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| Obviously, I think it'd be great if we all lived in South Knoxville and went to an elementary and then directly to a middle and then a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| But my area is one of those that's in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| And what I can see with this one happening is probably kids getting split up after elementary, some to Carnes and some to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3888)|
| 1:04:58| What I hope people will look at is when that happens, if they get sent to, say, they're at this elementary school and they get sent to Carnes Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3898)|
| 1:05:07| that they then go on to Carnes High and that they don't go back to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| Every year, it's those parents that want the transfer, and I completely understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| You're already making them get away from their friends once, so I really hope that we will think through that middle-high school transition and whatever the split is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3920)|
| 1:05:29| If they can all stick together and all go to one middle and one high school together, but I'm guessing that's not going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| But I really think once they get to middle school, those middle schoolers need to transition all to the same high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| I hope people will keep that in the thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| Absolutely. And we've had those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| And I can tell you, as a principal at a high school and a middle school, in rezoning, when we get into those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3949)|
| 1:05:58| we really look at the grade level, what students get grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| Then you get into the conversation of siblings. So that's something that we are certainly going to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| We are definitely taking that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| You're probably already hearing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| Does anybody have anything else for Dr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| Do we have a time on the ribbon-cutting for Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| I apologize, I didn't put that on the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Anything else? Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| I have one comment, Madam Chair Christie. Sweet Peas is no longer in South Knoxville, so you have to find me a good barbecue place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| We have one. We'll talk after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| I've already been to Love's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| Ms. Babb, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| So we do not have anyone signed up for public forum. Is that correct, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| All right, so moving on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| Ms. Owen, Mr. Watson, Ms. Babb, Ms. Horn, Ms. Henderson, Ms. Bounds, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4036)|
| 1:07:26| All right, meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4046)|
| 1:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220727?start=4056)|
