| 0:01:09| to listen and to act for the benefit of all of our citizens as we conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| Knoxville's business and help us to treat all those who come before us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| dignity, fairness, and respect, and as always, help us to be mindful of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| less fortunate than ourselves. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=85)|

| 0:01:35| America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=100)|

| 0:02:20| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| We're not sure, I guess. I believe we have an item for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| Can we come back to that? Okay. Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Okay. The consent items, they're 11C to 11H and 12L to 12P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=159)|
| 0:02:49| Are you going to move for both of those? Move for approval. We'll do them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=169)|

| 0:03:04| Councilman Grieve, are you ready yet? Okay. We can come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| I'm going to go ahead with the mayor's report, give you some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| Several things I want to report on tonight. First of all, I want to recognize, we have some folks in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| We have Boy Scout Troop 55 from Fountain City Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| They're here working on their badges. Would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=204)|
| 0:03:35| Excuse me. We appreciate you and your scout masters for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| Also in the audience, we have Brody Husky. Where's Brody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Stand up, Brody. He is with Troop 22 of the Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| And his citizenship and the community merit badge, which is required to become an Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| So glad to have you here and good luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| I also want to recognize our very own Christy Branscom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| Any of you watching TV last night, the Extreme Makeover Home Edition shown nationally, perhaps internationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| It was about Knoxville and the great home build that we had last January here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| with the Watson family, who are the power behind the Restoration House nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=258)|
| 0:04:27| Helps single moms and kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| And Christy Branscom and her husband were the lead builders with Grace Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| They showed the two-hour special last night. Hope everybody saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| Great community and volunteer spirit that we have in Knoxville with some 4,000 volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| who came out to help to work with the Home Edition and to help the Watson family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| So Christy, I don't know if you want to make any comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| Really just to say thank you to everyone who participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| We had great volunteers on the site, over 4,500 people in our community came out to support the Watson family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| and Restoration House, and I'm just humbled and very honored to have been a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| Thank you, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| I hope the chief has corralled Turtlezilla or whatever that thing was stomping through downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| We've got him under control. Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| Personally has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| And I was in New York for two different events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| We went to the Bloomberg Mayor's Challenge Ideas Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| and we are one of 20 or so finalists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| for a potential $5 million grant or $1 million grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| to implement our bold, creative idea, which is to establish an urban food corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| So we spent two days getting to know what they're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| and further developing our ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| and we have to all cities resubmit by the end of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| and then by spring we will know if we're one of the winning cities or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| That was a wonderful experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| We then went over to Palisades, New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| for the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge, our summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| and Knoxville is a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| They announced while we were there that Knoxville is one of, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| 31 cities across the world that were selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| 11 mayors from six continents who were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| I mean, mayors from six continents. I don't know how many of them. A lot of them that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| And there were a number of speakers and more talk about what we can expect as the winner of the IBM Challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| in which we will have a team of six IBM experts brought in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| to work for three weeks straight with our staff and community stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| around the issue of how we develop a system in which the folks who need utility bill assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| emergency assistance year after year, we need to actually get to the root cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| and do home renovations, home energy efficiency upgrades, and weatherization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| So instead of putting a Band-Aid on the problem each year, we're actually getting to the root cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| So that team is going to come in and work with our stakeholders in the community to try and set up a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| that we can make that happen. So those were two really excellent opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| that we had representing Knoxville. Also, three weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| but I haven't had the opportunity to say thanks to council and to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| for supporting the pension reform plan that this council voted to put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| We had 76 percent. That's a resounding landslide, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| for that hybrid plan. So I want to thank council, Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| I publicly that night thanked a lot of the staff, but Bill Lyons, council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Vice Mayor Paulus, all of you put in the hours and the time, and our employee representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| who worked so hard with us on that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| Christmas in the City got underway this past weekend and will continue through December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| The Comcast Christmas at Chilhowee Park. So come on down to Chilhowee Park between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| 6 and 9 p.m. Free activities such as marshmallow roasting, face painting, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| And we want to thank our special events office and Judith Foltz sitting there in the front row for making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| she and her staff makes all of this possible, along with our sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| Also, on this coming Sunday, the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Community Band will have their Christmas concert. This is sponsored by the Parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Rec Department, and that will be 3 o'clock this Sunday at the Bijou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| And, of course, a week from this Friday is the Christmas parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| So we look forward to seeing everybody down there at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| 645 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| 7 o'clock is when we're marching. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| And I believe that is all that I have for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| Mayor Brown. Yes, Mayor, I want to just acknowledge the passing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| the late Miss Lois Kelly, who was a resident of the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| and lived to be 104. She was a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| educator and also active in the local civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| history in this community. And certainly our condolences to her family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| and she'll be greatly missed in the community. Thank you, Mayor Brown. She was at our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| luncheon this past spring as well, and I know was at several of my events last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| year, and we will miss her. It was a very nice service in her honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| Whose light is that? Councilman Campin. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to invite everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| to come out. Fountain City is having a Christmas Day parade this Saturday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| Share the Fountain City with Councilman Del Volpe and certainly come out at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| Saturday morning to join the festivities. Very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| Any other reports from Council? Okay. I can't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| Sorry. There you go. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| I just wanted to announce to those who are in the audience or listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| on TV that Old North Knoxville is going to have its annual Victorian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| Holiday Home Tour. And they've been doing this for 24 years. On December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| the 1st and December the 2nd, they're going to have these home tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| The Saturday, December the 1st one is from 4 to 9 p.m. The Sunday, December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| the 2nd one is from 1230 to 5 p.m. Go to a Kroger store. You can buy your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| tickets in advance for $10. If you wait until the day of the event, I think it's $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| But you get to tour nine homes and a church this time, but they're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| you through some of these wonderful old Victorian homes that are being restored in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| and it's a treat. So if you can go, have at it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| Very good. Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlis. I forgot that I'll be ringing the bell for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| a great cause. Saturday is the 8th. I don't believe we'll meet before then at Kroger on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| Chapman Highway from 10 to 12 for the Salvation Army, so I hope folks can come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| and give some folding money, no jingling money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| You accept. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Councilman Starr. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to announce on December 4th at 530| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| the Public Properties Naming Committee will meet, I believe, in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| But the meeting will be at 530 on December 4th. Thank you. Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| Okay. Now we're going to go back to items for postponement. Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| Oh, thank you, Mayor. I appreciate your patience. I'd like to go ahead and recommend that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| postpone 12J. As all of my colleagues are aware, we have a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| code changes that we're looking at tonight, all the way from 12A to 12J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| 12J, what we need is we need a little bit more time to review and understand this code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=756)|

| 0:14:56| Councilman Del Valle. Yeah, I had a question last time and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| Susanna wasn't here, but the question essentially was what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| happens? This regulates, I guess, non-electric vehicles using these special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| spots where the chargers are. What if we have some bad boy electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| vehicle that pulls up, charges, and then goes off for eight hours to have sandwiches and go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| and stays in front of this very limited space? Do we deal with that in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| We do. Susanna Sutherland, 400 Main Street. We will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| the ability to sort of remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| those vehicles that end up camping in the downtown spaces or even in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| The charge automatically disconnects after the vehicle battery is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| So we won't be draining electricity with these people, but we do want to make sure that the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| spaces have the ability to turn over. So yes, that is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| How long does it take normally to charge one of these things? It probably varies from type vehicle, but is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| estimated time? Well, if the battery is totally empty, it will take about four hours. But if it's a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| charge, we're looking at an hour and a half to two hours. Okay. And then they're supposed to charge and then move off so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| someone else can use the facility. Absolutely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=971)|

| 0:17:16| Yeah. I wanted to ask a question, Madam Mayor, to Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| There was a little sideboard discussion during the NPC hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| about a piece of property that someone wanted to be commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| and not the way it was normally zoned, I think, in this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| Maybe I'm dreaming. Maybe I'm confusing this with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| Is that segment within the city is the first question, and secondly, it looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| like NPC was deferring that to another day. Could you tell us just a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| At the Knox County public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1076)|

| 0:18:06| representative for that property that was discussed at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| formally withdrew their request that they had expressed at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| about reclassifying a piece of property along John Sevier Highway from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| to some hybrid combination of office and industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| classification. The Planning Commission chose not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| make that amendment at their public hearing, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| the applicant or the representative for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| formally withdrew that request. So we're looking at the basic plan without regard to that issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1126)|

| 0:20:01| Thank you, Mayor. I guess this is for Mark Donaldson as well. These next three items deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| with the sector plan and the one-year plan and the zoning for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| property off of Greenway Drive. And the comments were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| made in the text about the steepness of the back portion of the property. I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| understand that MPC is only allowing this mixed-use on the front half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Is that a fair understanding? Because the back half was steep and maybe in the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| protection area. That's correct. There is a fairly distinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| change in slope about midway back on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| immediately behind the existing buildings. And if you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| current zoning map, you will see that change in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| happens on many of the tracks along Greenway in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| whereby the front half of the properties have one zoning and the rear has either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| agriculture or a residential zone district. All right. So we're talking about the front half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| getting this sort of higher or more active use. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1266)|

| 0:23:26| All right. Once you get those three tracks, you'll then have a notice to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| with construction and you've got a six month period to do the work. Yeah, the design is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| complete. But the goal here is to move this stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| sort of inboard a bit and have it in a more what wooded parkland kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1421)|

| 0:23:56| it's also kind of tending to undermine the road to an extent. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| we get it into the middle of this area. It's got some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1441)|

| 0:24:26| Williams Creek. Is that going to be part of this effort? The part you're disturbing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| Well, it will be part of the urban forest effort, but I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| that it's going to be a big or a big enough area for an actual greenway. And part of it's going to be right on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| creek. And this particular project is is a relatively small piece. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| it would it could be a link in a little. I noticed you only had two hundred twenty five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| Thank you so much. OK, we have a I'm sorry, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| Yes. The other parcels that you need to acquire, they also are joining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| this parcel. Yeah. Yes, they are. And none of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| buildable. They're all low and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| this will help somewhat in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| developing some of the adjacent empty lots just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| the water's got some place defined to be. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| so it in a way enhances it enhances the community by having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| forested area. It's going to help the entire area because there's other improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| in that area as well. So I'm glad to see it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| OK, thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| The ayes have it. And so ordered. Eleven B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| with all occasions party rentals for the provision of rental equipment for various special events held at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| for a cost not to exceed thirty thousand dollars. So move. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed. The ayes have it. And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| OK, we're now on to ordinances on first reading and 10 items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| are related to the new construction codes that we are bringing to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| for approval. So before we get into each one of these individually, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| call on Christie Branscom, our senior director of public works, to give an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| Great. Again, Christie Branscom, senior director of public works. The city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| public works department and the fire department are requesting that Knoxville City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| adopt various codes. The city is currently enforcing the 2006 editions of construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| and property maintenance codes published by the International Code Council and the National Fire Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| Association. One uniform fire code known as NFPA is being relied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| upon for fire prevention. I believe most of you understand that the ICC is a membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| organization dedicated to building safety, fire prevention, and energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| And over 19,000 jurisdictions across the United States adopt ICC codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| In fact, our state of Tennessee adopted the ICC codes as well. Building codes are obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| critical to our community. The regulation of construction protects all of us from catastrophic consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| of building construction failures and protects property values across our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| I'll start with a short explanation of the construction codes. The first set to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| for approval is the ICC construction codes with our local amendments. The public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| department and specifically the permits and inspections division engaged in an in-depth process to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| and compare the currently adopted construction codes to the newly published 2012 codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| The various stakeholders and public were engaged in this process through various small group meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| the building board of adjustment and appeals board meetings, and public forum. Internal meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| began back in the spring of 2012. We met with Knox County. We also met with the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| of Farragut and embarked on a campaign to begin informing the industry stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| and the public in general of the plan. Some of the groups with whom we met were the Associated Builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| and Contractors, the Home Builders Association of Knoxville, who I think is represented here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| tonight, and the American Institute of Architects local chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| At these meetings, the codes were discussed and analyzed and local amendments were added to address their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| We included notices of the impending code changes in all of our communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| through the permits and inspections department. We also posted information regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| the code changes in the permits and inspections department. As a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| of this process, the city of Knoxville plumbing and mechanical gas boards also met to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| specifically the proposed codes that they need to be adopted, and these boards unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| voted to recommend adoption. The building board of adjustments and appeals met on three different occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| and then hosted an open forum for the public that was advertised in the Knoxville News Sentinel on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| different occasions, and the adoption of the codes were discussed and considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| On November 16, 2012, the BBAA, which is the Building Board of Adjustments and Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| made their recommendation for submission of the 2012 construction codes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| Knoxville City Council for approval. The proposed codes were then published in the Knoxville City Recorder's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| Office on November 19, 2012. Should Knoxville City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| Council approve adoption of the codes, then it would be our staff's recommendation and intent to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| the effective date of such codes as May 1, 2013. After input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| from the various stakeholders in the community, it was agreed that such a 120-day grace period would give everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| plenty of time to become educated about the new codes and to understand best how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| adapt to those. The 2012 construction codes being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| this evening for adoption include the International Residential Code, the International| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| Building Code, the International Performance Code, the International Energy Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| Code, the Fuel Gas Code, the International Mechanical Code, the International| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| Plumbing Code, and the International Existing Building Code. In addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| to the obvious benefit to our citizens to ensure safety and protect them, the codes also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| help the City of Knoxville's Insurance Services Office rating that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| known as an ISO rating. ISO is a leading source of information about property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| casualty insurance risk. The information that is gathered by ISO is relied upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| for measuring a city or municipality's effectiveness in regards to its community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| The concept is that municipalities with well-enforced, up-to-date codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| should demonstrate better loss experience, and therefore insurance rates should reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| With the adoption of these codes, the City of Knoxville is also going to begin doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| residential plans review. This is new for the city, and we're anxious to see how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| implementation of this new process may also affect the ISO's residential rating. And obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| the intent is that we hope it does a positive effect for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| So that includes the first set of codes for regards to construction. We are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| proposing that the Property Maintenance Code, a new one for 2012, be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| As I mentioned earlier, we are operating under the 2006 Property Maintenance Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| Adoption of the 2012 International Property Maintenance Code will allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| our Enforcement Division to be working within the most current standards within which to perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| their duties. This new code provides better definitions and explanations for many of the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| relied upon by our codes enforcement officers. And, of course, greater clarification provides a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| understanding for our city citizens as well. Once adopted by City Council, the 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| Property Maintenance Code we recommend would become effective January 1, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| The final code is the International Fire Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Currently, the Knoxville Fire Department observes the NFPA, as I mentioned previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| But after careful review and study, the Knoxville Fire Department has determined to be the best interest of our city to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| adopt the 2012 International Fire Code. The IFC is published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| and a part of the ICC family of codes. So such adoption would be consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| Construction and Property Maintenance Codes being proposed for adoption tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| It will allow for the streamlined implementation of the IFC requirements and eliminate the potential for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| conflict between what is directed regarding fire protection in the ICC codes and the NFPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| The request for the adoption of the IFC by the Fire Department represents a progressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| and prominent decision by the Knoxville Fire Department. As with the Construction Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| we do propose the effective date of the International Fire Code be May 1, 2013 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| allow for a grace period as well. But I believe that the Fire Department would probably also like to make a brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| explanation of this as well. Thank you, Christy. Chief Sharp. Yes, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| Christy. Christy has covered virtually all of the background there. But what I do want to just reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| is that we did earlier this year go over a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| exhaustive and careful review of the most recent edition of the International Fire Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| primarily to familiarize ourselves with it and to make sure that we were comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| with it from a safety standpoint. And therefore, as a result of that, we do feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| good about it as far as protecting the safety of our citizens and our firefighters. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| as a result of that review and also just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| make our Building Codes and our Fire Codes be more compatible, we are recommending that we adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| the 2012 International Fire Code and Performance Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| All right. Thank you. I do want to say I think I really am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| very impressed with all the work that Christy and her team did to bring this to us. All of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| meetings, they went out. They just didn't wait for people to come to them. They went out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| affected stakeholders and also really recognized the Fire Department for carefully reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| this. I think this is a big step for us to bring these into compatibility with the Fire Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| and the Construction Code. So this is a good night, I think, for us as we take a look at all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| these, the adoption of these codes. Councilman Dellivopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to ask a question or two and then make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| One question is if a member of the public wants to look at some portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| of a Building Code or a Maintenance Code or something, can they go online and do that or do they have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| downtown and buy the code in a book form and take it home and study it? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| how do they have access to this information, which is incorporated into our ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| It is recorded in the City Recorder's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| Right. But is it online anywhere or do they have to come and sit in Cindy's office and take a peek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| It's not online at this point. We do have the code books in the Permits and Inspections Office, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| for purchase. Usually they're like 50 or 75 bucks a pop, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| Do you have that price sheet with you, Tom? No, I don't. But he's correct in about the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Matter of fact, it's a little bit more than that. Everything always goes up, not down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| But there are places where you can access the code online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| And the reason I ask that is because if some citizen is interested in looking at these between now and the next reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| they have a chance to look at some portion of the code. So thank you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| My comment, I guess, is in some 37 years of practicing litigation and commercial litigation involving construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2121)|
| 0:35:31| these codes obviously stand out as a way for the industry to learn from past mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2131)|
| 0:35:40| from past problems and failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| Like a brute animal just repeating the same dumb mistake, hopefully we learn from those mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| and these codes embody that good practice information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| And so it really is an important step for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| And I know we've had different forms of codes for decades, but it's a way to not repeat, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| the house blowing off the foundation or the frost cracking the footing or all the things that would disturb you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| if you bought a house or have a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| And it's obviously the industry learning from collective knowledge and looking at new materials that enter the workplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| and the marketplace, and it's a good thing that we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you. And then Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| And the thoroughness that apparently has been devoted to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| As I spoke to you this afternoon, one of my concerns is being customer friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| And I don't know if you can address that, or you mentioned it briefly in the residential just a second ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| but I'm hoping that we can translate that to all of our processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| I know that Ms. Saunders is a liaison person in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| She has been helping us with customer surveys and getting good feedback for us in the permits inspection division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| and helping engineering and other departments, which I manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| helping them understand good customer service and understand the feedback we're getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| perhaps where we're not doing all the things we need to do, but learning from the feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| and trying to determine what we can do to improve our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| It would be my intent to eventually, probably going to be sometime in the first quarter of 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| to have a monthly meeting where we could have all of the players around the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| where we could have permits and inspections, a representative from engineering, perhaps someone from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| I haven't mentioned that to Mark yet, but some others to come around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| to talk about projects and plans and things that they would like to do within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| so that we can try to get them started in the right direction so they don't get bounced from departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| or that they get all of their questions answered on the front end so they don't get too far down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| with a particular item before they realize that, you know, maybe they're headed down the wrong road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| So we are working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| That is something we continue to strive to improve upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| and give a lot of credit to Tom Reynolds and Jim Hackerman as well in engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| to try to help answer all of our customers' questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| and to provide them the best guidance that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| But we know that we can do better, and I think we've got some plans to try to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| Thank you. Thanks, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| I do also want to say I think you've done a great job reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| The builders that I reached out to today were informed about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| and had come to meetings and participated in discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| and were particularly appreciative of the amendments that you all agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| and I appreciate that kind of collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Ashley Burnett is here representing the Knoxville Home Builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| and I think he signed up to speak, and I'd like for him to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Let's go ahead and hear from him next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| I think, Ashley, your comments are on all of these codes basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| We're kind of a little bit out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| We don't have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| but since we're going to deal with all of these comments deal with basically all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| I'm going to go ahead and ask you to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Ashley Burnett, Home Builders Association of Greater Knoxville, 221 Clark Street, Northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| I appreciate the time to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| I believe we're speaking mainly on the residential codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| but my main purpose for being here tonight is to compliment you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| and commend your administration for putting together your team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| specifically Christy Branscombe with the job that she's done in public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and bringing us all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| She's been very open, and the process has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| We've had several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| It's been a very good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| As Mr. Wallace pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| we are pleased with the amendments that are there for the residential side of the codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| and we appreciate all of her hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Appreciate you all participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I just want to say also, again, Christy, thanks to you and Tom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| and everyone that's worked on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| As an architect, you know, it's important that we have codes that are consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| both from the state, the county, and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| and this is certainly going to help with the architects in terms of practicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| And so, again, I want to thank Christy and her staff for all that they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| and encourage all my colleagues to go ahead and pass on all these this evening on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| And just everybody knows that since this is an ordinance, this does take two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| So we'll be – should these pass tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| then we'll be back next – in two weeks for the second reading of each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| And so we're about to get started, and these are – oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I also want to concur with my colleagues that this has cleared up for me some confusion about where to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| who to speak with, and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| And as constituents call and have questions who are not necessarily home builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| but some of this impacts people who may have a garage or second story or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| I think that it really cleans up some language and makes things a lot more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| So as I have questions, at least now I know where to direct them a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Yes, on that line, I wanted to ask when you went out and contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| and talked with community organizations, did you get much feedback from these community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| positive feedback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| I assume that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| And certainly thank you for a very good presentation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| We met with a lot of professional organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| We also notified them via e-mail and fax of all of our meetings and our open forum as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| So they were invited to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Some of them provided some written comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| And, of course, some of them were present at those meetings and participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| But we got really good feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I noticed Margaret Backhurst is here this evening as well to represent architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| Of course, Mr. Greer can represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| But Margaret is here if you want to ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| But she would be another professional organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| She represents an organization that we met with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| So we got really good feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Everyone was very positive and, I believe, very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| I just also wanted to thank Angela Halver because she helped me tremendously through this process from the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| Where is Angela?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Angela, stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| She did a lot of work from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| I got a lot of kudos, but she really helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| And she was with me all the way through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I just want to make sure she's acknowledged for her hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Thank you, Angela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Councilman Greer, is your light on again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| I know that we're getting ready to vote on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| And I thought maybe it might be good if our attorney could explain why we have to vote on each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| Because several people had asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| And so I thought, Charles, if you could go ahead and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| Well, in the interest of time, it would be nice if we could just lump them all together and vote on them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| As an attorney, though, you always worry about worst-case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| And the worst-case scenario here is that somebody somewhere dissatisfied with being required to comply with these codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| should bring suit against the city and say that they were improperly passed and that they're all lumped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| And they are very different subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Each of these codes is a very different code dealing with very different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| And so rather than have to deal with that as a potential issue in a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| it would be much preferable on the front end to just go ahead and take that little extra time and vote on each of them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| Do it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| That's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| And in addition, I was informed by the law department that Ms. Mitchell does not have to read the entire caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| So she is prepared to read the most relevant parts of the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Isn't that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| So now, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Article 2A, an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville amending Chapter 6, Article 2A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| subsections 6, 41, and 42 of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| adopting the 2012 edition of the International Residential Code for one- and two-family dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| including appendices A, B, C, D, E, F, J, K, N, and P,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| with amendments as provided in this ordinance as the Residential Building Code of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| And that is the short version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| So am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Yeah, I just wanted to call attention to one section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| and maybe ask Ms. Branscom, since it's her department, if we can use this as part of our codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| I realize we have the maintenance one coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| but R104.9 on page 8 or page 361 of the agenda deals with unsafe buildings or structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2694)|
| 0:45:05| and if they're unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| or constitute a fire hazard or otherwise dangerous to human life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| the buildings or structures are declared illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| and it says shall be abated by repair and rehabilitation or by demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| I guess the question is do you foresee us using that as a code-type enforcement tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| to get after the sort of the bad buildings in the barrel that are affecting the good ones next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| Well, we can certainly look at that, but I'm going to defer to Tom Reynolds to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| Councilman Dela Valle, in the past we've used this section to literally bring buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| before the Better Building Board for condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| These are the ones that when you have a bad actor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| you finally bring them before the Better Building Board to review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Do I understand, I guess the second question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| do I understand that if somehow one of these codes doesn't fit really well with a particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| that's why we have that appeal board you were talking about that you can go before them after a denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| and present the information about why you should do it slightly differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Why you should get a variance from that particular regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| That's a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| It's the Building Board of Adjustments and Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| So we have a safety valve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2786)|

| 0:49:29| Maybe I'm with Tom Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| My memory is we had a workshop every bit of a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| and we were talking about some legislative measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| that we wanted to look into to make sure that rental properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| and other properties were properly maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| And we had officials from Oak Ridge that came and spoke to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| and talked about this International Property Maintenance Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| as one of the tools they could use to deal with poorly maintained structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| Now, we don't have the actual code in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| We have the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| But is that your understanding this can be used by, I guess, Tom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| by the code's officials under your jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| to get after poorly maintained problem buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| That is the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| and it would be enforced by our codes enforcement department in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| That is the intent of the International Property Maintenance Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil121127?start=3021)|
