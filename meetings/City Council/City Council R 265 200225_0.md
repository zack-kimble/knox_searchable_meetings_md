| 0:07:44| And then I also just wanted to announce that Item 12M involves the Metropolitan Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| I'm the council representative on the Metropolitan Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| That doesn't create any issue, but I just wanted to make sure that that was noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=478)|

| 0:08:19| Congratulations on your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| We're happy to have you, and you are representing the 1st District Council District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| There's a strong slate of seven applicants, and I was watching your deliberation from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| and commend you guys for running a great process and, you know, doing a thorough job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| and appreciate all your effort on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Council member Smith is an executive vice president for marketing at Ackerman PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| resident of the Island Home neighborhood, president of Keep Knoxville Beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| which I think is having an event as we speak, so thank you for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| and has a long history of volunteering and participating in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| And I also want to welcome someone that we all know and recognize and appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| As Mr. Smith joins us, council member Ms. Welch is joining my administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| as my chief deputy for economic and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| I'm really glad to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| I see you on the other side of the room, so thank you for accepting my job offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| Legislative breakfast last week after your long Thursday night meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Thank you for those of you who were able to come to the legislative breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| As we said to our delegation, we get a lot more done when we work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| and I thought everyone was very mindful in that room that we all have similar objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| to represent the people of Knoxville, whether it's here in the city or in the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| So thank you for being part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Today I had the opportunity to attend, and so did council member Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| the grand opening or ribbon-cutting of Axel Logistics' new $13 million build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| of its new headquarters at 835 North Central Street, which is just west of Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| It's been a vacant building for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| and now it's going to have 50 new employees immediately and another 200 in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| And it's a great example of a city partnership to catalyze private investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| in a redevelopment part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| So on the city side, $200,000 was committed from the Historic Preservation Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| because it's a historic building and a very sustainable commitment to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| that already has great infrastructure and sidewalks and sewer and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| It's also going to benefit from the $6 million streetscape improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| that happened on Central Street and got completed a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| and is next to a lot of properties on Broadway and Emory Place and Central Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| that have benefited from the city's Facade Improvement Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| including Elkmont Exchange and the Press Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| So thank you for those who were able to come. It was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Thanks to all the city staff members who participated in making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| A couple announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=671)|

| 0:11:20| It's going to be at Overcoming Believers Church at 211 Harriet Tubman Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| and this is for owners of small business and minority-owned, women-owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| It's a chance for them to interact and network, learn about city contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| big and small, that are coming up for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| So any council members, you're welcome to attend for any part of that that you have time for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| There's going to be people there from the city, Knox County, Blount County, Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| the State of Tennessee, University of Tennessee, Airport Authority, KUB, KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=710)|

| 0:11:58| So to all vendors and people who do services and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| I invite you to attend and learn more about how to do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| with the City of Knoxville and other local entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| Saturday, March 7th, is one of my favorite events in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| that Councilmember Testerman is a very big part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| It's the 13th Annual Mardi Gras Parade and Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| It starts at 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, March 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| It's in downtown in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Last year, over 15,000 people and their pets attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| and there are more details at mardigras.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| And this is not just a fun thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Also, the proceeds go to Young-Williams Animal Shelter, which is led by Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| So I invite you guys to attend that and bring your pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I want to share with you also two upcoming public meetings that are open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| and, of course, city council members are encouraged and welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| First is, on Sunday, I met Councilmember Smith and Charles Lomax, our Director of Community Empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=778)|
| 0:13:07| and I met with members of the Fort Kidd Committee, Beth Waters and her husband and son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=787)|
| 0:13:17| We met at Fort Kidd and learned a little bit about the history of how it was built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| and all the community participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| It was packed with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| It was a great opportunity to see it firsthand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| and we are going to learn more and learn more from the public about what they want for its future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| and what the constraints are as far as, you know, safety and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| So there's going to be a public meeting about Fort Kidd Thursday, March 12th, 5.30 p.m. at the Knoxville Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| So I'm committed to stabilizing the site, making Fort Kidd safe and ADA accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| Like many of you, I grew up, my kids grew up going to that park, and so did many other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| Either you came here as kids yourselves or brought your own kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| So right now, the city, there's $600,000 of it, half from the city, half from private donors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| and I'm committed to rebuilding Fort Kidd and preserving it as a play space for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| So on March 12th, we're going to hear from families about what they want to see in the future of Fort Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| So work is scheduled to begin on a new Fort Kidd later in the spring, but the first thing is to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| The other public meeting I wanted to share with you, invite you all to, is a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| It's my human resources working group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| For several years, Mayor O'Hara was working on establishing a human resources department for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| which most cities our size have, and most private sector businesses, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| So I've been examining that and talking to various people about the benefits and costs of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| and I think that we need to, first and foremost, strengthen and protect our civil service protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| and make sure that we maintain our protections and grievance procedures and anti-discrimination practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| and make sure the Civil Service Merit Board has full authority to honor those rules and set those rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=914)|
| 0:15:22| and make sure that we, the administration, are adhering to those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| The HR department would be in charge of human resources, which, you know, 60% of our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| as you all know from the budget retreat, goes to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| And so how can we best serve them and make sure that they are getting the development and resources they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| As you are very familiar, we are having big, big challenges recruiting people, particularly to our police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| and I think an HR department could help a lot with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| So I am having a work group meeting, and there's been a lot of interest in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| so we are having it at the Public Works Complex next Thursday, March 5th at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| at the Public Works Service Center, 3131 Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| All are welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| Employees are welcome to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| There should be plenty of space, and I look forward to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| And that was what I wanted to share with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| And if you have any questions between now and then, you know, feel free to give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| Also, it's my pleasure tonight, and this is my last item for the Mayor's Report, to introduce Rosa Maher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| She's Chair of the Police Advisory and Review Committee, and she is here tonight to provide some –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| she's provided copies of the Parks 2019 Annual Report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| and she's going to address us and give us a short overview of what that report contains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| Ms. Maher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| I'd also like to introduce Clarence Vaughn, who is the Executive Director of PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| and he reports to Charles Lomax, who is the manager of our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| You've all received a copy, and thank you, everybody, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| I'm sure you're not here for me, but it's nice to have an audience for once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Normally there's, like, two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| So anyway, I'd like – I'm not going to read the whole report because you guys can read it just fine without me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| but I do want to highlight that first I want to thank Dan Fry, who put the report together for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| and he did a nice job of making it pretty for us today, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| On page five is a nice photograph of all of the seven members that are on PARC today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| and then the next page gives you the terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| So we are all appointed by our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| So for most of you, this is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Several of you are – this is going to be a repeat of what we did last year because we do a report every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| and I will admit that it's nice to see all the ladies that I'm presenting to today, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| So, like I said, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I do want to highlight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| in 2019 PARC received 85 cases, which is the same number that we had in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| You know, we take a positive look that really our community still feels strongly about submitting cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| and PARC closed the total of 79 citizen complaints in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| Of the closed cases, 53 were resolved by the executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| two were resolved by mediation with the executive director and KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| and 11 were referred to appropriate agencies, and 13 were resolved by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| Of those 11, 8 were referred to the city, county, sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| which I think is one of the areas that we want to continue to have a good relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| because as far as the citizens are concerned, a police person is a police person is a police person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| They don't know the difference between whether it's city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| On the next page, PARC members have reviewed and discussed during the quarterly meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| a total of 12 internal affairs cases and 11 referral action reforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| provided by the internal affairs unit of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| The leading nature of the complaints were as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| unprofessional conduct, rudeness, harassment, and citizen advocacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| The nature of the complaints is outlined in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| We've broken it down by who, gender, men, women, and why, ethnicity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| and what the complaints were about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| So there is a very detailed report provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Throughout the year, the committee and executive director strive to improve coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| and communication with the internal affairs unit and senior staff of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| And Clarence spends a lot of time throughout the year making presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| meeting with organizations and groups so that we can continue to develop that close relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| with the police department and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| And Chief Thomas has been at the forefront of doing that, which is really very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| I also want to thank the mayor and the chief for being supportive of getting the body cameras for our policemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1212)|
| 0:20:21| That has been a consistent concern of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| and I think that we are now finally on the verge of getting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| and I think that's been because of our citizens requesting it and because of Park's support for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| On a final note, please be assured, Park strives to ensure that its procedures, operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| and communications are always courteous, respectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| and in full compliance with the Tennessee Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| And I will admit that took me a couple of emails to get that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| I would respond to everybody, and I finally get that you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| So anyway, and in full compliance with the Tennessee Open Records Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| as well as other statutes and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| As always, the committee welcomes any input from the mayor, city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| Knoxville Police Department, and Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| So I now will open it up to any questions that you may have for me or for Clarence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you, Ms. Marr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Council Member Parker, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| No, this is my first time seeing this report, and I appreciate you for presenting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| In the future, however, it would be helpful if we could receive the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| and even include it on the agenda so that the public can see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| and then we can have a public discussion and review the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| and the public would have an opportunity if they have questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| We'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And thank you for the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| This is literally the third time I've done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| and this is the first time that that's been requested, so I appreciate the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Yeah, it's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Any other questions for Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Ms. Marr, could you maybe share with everyone that's in the audience the meeting dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| the cadence of the meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| We do have it quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Our next quarterly meeting is set for April the 16th, and have we a location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| It's to be determined, but we always have it in a public place, and we do have it quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| So April 16th will be the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| And I just want to point out, when I was looking through the ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| that you do have some limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| and one of the limitations that I see here is that if a person has a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| and they come to PARC, if they are actively suing KPD or the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| that is part of the limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| You guys cannot hear the case at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| I had heard something from Clarence recently that I wanted to share with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| Would you mind talking about when someone has a complaint with the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| why it's advantageous to go through PARC rather than through the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| I'm going to let Clarence speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| As you mentioned, Clarence, I might as well speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Good evening, Mayor, members of Council, also members of the Cabinet and community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| For that comment, I was saying as far as transparency, not to choose one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| Citizens have the option to go to the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| which is the Internal Affairs Unit, or they can come to PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| My comment was really based on transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| A lot of times citizens ask, what happens to a complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| There's a full process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| So if they decide to come to PARC, we can review that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| provide some recommendations to the Knoxville Police Department Internal Affairs Unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| so they can do further investigation because we're not an investigative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| We want to, of course, respect the fact that we have an investigative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| through our Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| But if you go to the Internal Affairs Unit, of course, and start that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| we still have it on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| So once you start the process with the Internal Affairs Unit to review any allegations or concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| it goes through their process through KPD, and it is still shared with the PARC committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| That's what we share during our quarterly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Every quarter we share all the cases which Chair Rosamar shared with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| the referral action forms for the year, and also the internal affair cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| We share those publicly during our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| We do not share officers' names or complainants' names, but we share the type of complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| So I wasn't saying for that comment to choose one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| It's really for citizens to know that there's a complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| transparent process to your complaint if it goes through PARC or KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| but it's good to have us involved either on the front end or back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| to make sure we have some input on what the process looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| And I would like to add, having sat in on some of these, is that it's more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| It is less intimidating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| and I think that people feel safe in coming to PARC to make their complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| versus going to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I just want to echo that, and I want to commend you all for the great work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| I have attended the quarterly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| It's great information and really encourage community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| and council members to attend because, you know, it is good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| not just that's in here but things that we can address throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| One of the highlights in our meetings is we always have a police training session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| and I think actually that's probably the highlight of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| is having police officers give training sessions on a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| And one of the most popular was, if you get stopped by a policeman, the do's and don'ts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| and I actually learned quite a bit about what don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| So I was pleased that we were able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you so much, Ms. Maher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| We appreciate your volunteer service and for chairing this important committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| and thank you, Mr. Vaughn, for answering our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And that concludes the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Are there any reports from council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Yes, I just wanted to announce that the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1572)|

| 0:27:09| that we've done on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| As many of you know, Hollywood Road is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| and that's had some impact on the folks in Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| So we've been hosting these lunches to let everybody know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| that Sutherland Avenue is still open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1640)|

| 0:27:52| Probably some people sitting around this table will be cooking pancakes that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1672)|

| 0:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| There is a lot in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Is there someone who can speak to what we're approving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Because there are a lot of different parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Ms. Brooks, could you speak to this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Amy Brooks, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| The planning staff had worked with City of Knoxville staff to identify some minor amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| basically to clarify some language and some inconsistencies in the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| And you can see there is a brief overview there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| I apologize if you can't hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| So the first one is to recognize and clarify that the Planning Commission, not BZA, reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| special use applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| That was a typo in the zoning ordinance that we needed to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| It also confirms that the downtown design review guidelines apply to properties in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| It confirms that the N district designation can be applied to any neighborhood, as directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| It also is a follow-up to last month's, well, this was a couple months ago, discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| sign standards in the industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| And it clarifies that the institutional designation should be applied to areas with a minimum size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| of five contiguous acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Also clarifies that sign standards apply to commercial, industrial, and institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| And assigns full administrative downtown design review to the planning staff, which is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| how it operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| And there was an addition of a citizen member, which is yet to be appointed by city administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Would you mind speaking, too, about the E-N district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Have there been any rules, conditions made for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| Or just the approval that any neighborhood can apply for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| There have been no additional rules or procedures that have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Just the clarification that E-N can be applied for to any district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| So the specifics will be worked on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| As they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2080)|

| 0:36:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| This issue stems back months, and it has actually years of history, and while I'm up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| on that history and had the time to prepare ahead of being appointed to City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| two parties have provided more information, or at least one of the parties have provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| a little bit more information to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| And as a result, I think that it requires more communication between the two parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| and also community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| As a result of the meeting, Dominion Group recently provided renderings to Mr. Kline's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| client, and in a moment I'm going to make a motion to postpone 10A for two weeks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| order for the community to have additional input based on those new materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| But first, I'm told I need to make a motion to suspend the rules as one of the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| has requested to be able to speak, make a brief statement regarding these materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| ahead of the two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| And the other side has offered that same opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Both parties are allowed to make that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| So the motion is to suspend our normal rules of procedure and allow each party up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| minutes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| To counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| One person, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| One person per, one from the appellant and one from the appellee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| The motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| It seems like one of the parties is going to present new information in their five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2273)|
| 0:38:02| Is this information that the other party has been privy to before now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| I'm not sure, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| The information was sent to counsel yesterday and distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| I don't know if, even counsel hasn't had time to review that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| So I believe one of the parties is going to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| So, well, council members, how do you wish to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| We have a motion on the floor to let one person from each side of this debate speak up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2306)|
| 0:38:36| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Ms. Parker, do you have reservations about that motion itself, just the allowing to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| I'm just concerned that the other party isn't able to review what's being presented so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| they can respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| So although the motion right now is to suspend order to allow each party to have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| to speak, I will then make a motion for a two-week postponement so both groups have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| time to review that material and the community has time to provide input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| I'd like to recognize this person at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Could you say your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| My name is Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Well, I was wondering if you were speaking to the motion about suspending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| I'm only going to speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Not actually speaking on behalf of the merits of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| I'm going to let him speak to the motion about suspending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| And then we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Go ahead, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Unless there's further questions, we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you very much, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Wayne Klein, Hodges Dowdy and Carson, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| I want to interpose an objection for the record that this is a quasi-judicial proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| As such, to allow the parties to have five minutes tonight and then postpone it to then come and argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2390)|
| 0:39:58| means that everybody gets two bites at the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| This should be heard one time by Your Honors, who are the judges of this, and one time only, not twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| And so I would object, and I place the objection on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Mr. Smith, do you have anything else to add to this motion about this proposed change in the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| I'll yield to legal counsel in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| There's been discussion back and forth between the proponent of this and the opponent of this to let people talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2426)|
| 0:40:36| I mean, yes, counsel is sitting as judges, but in many judicial proceedings you have motions that are heard before a trial is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2436)|
| 0:40:46| Mr. Swanson and I conferred before the meeting about an anticipated objection by Mr. Klein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| and these are counsel's rules, and we are of the opinion that if counsel decides to amend the rules to have what Mr. Smith is proposing, they may do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2455)|
| 0:41:06| Mr. Smith, did you have any other comment before we vote on this motion about how we discuss it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| So the motion is to allow one person from each side of this up to five minutes to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| and then it will go back to counsel for further discussion, and it sounds like Mr. Smith is going to propose a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Mr. Smith, is there a compelling reason why both parties want to speak tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| I'm just – Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| One of the parties would like to mention the need to speak, and so we wanted to make both parties the option to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| There is not a mandatory requirement for either party to speak, but we wanted to afford both parties the option to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| Does anyone need to speak tonight or ask to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| One has asked, requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Mr. Smith, any further thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| So we're ready to vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Everyone understands what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| All those in favor of the proceeding as we just described, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| The motion to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| So now I would like to call a representative of the appellant to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| and you have up to five minutes to speak if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| I think it's wrong for me to be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| I told you the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Wayne Klein, Hodges, Dutton, Carson, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| And so if I can, since I don't carry the burden of proof in this proceeding, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| Mr. Klein, just to make sure, you're representing Jennifer Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| And the severe neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| And because of that, I would like to defer and respond to whatever the appellee has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| So I would defer the rest of my time for rebuttal, if that's allowed, under your suspension of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2584)|
| 0:43:14| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I don't know if we need an official motion, but I would make a motion that Mr. Klein speak second as a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| It's the other party that asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| If that's okay with the council, that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| So we'll have the appellee who requested to speak address the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| and then we'll have the appellant have up to five minutes to respond to the information that's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| Good evening, Mayor, councilmembers, and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| My name is Sean Chalmers, representing Dominion Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Address is 3834 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I appreciate you giving us some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| We just wanted to briefly speak about the variances in question here, so I have a prepared statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| Our development, which is called South Banks, has been in design for the past 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| During that time, our team has worked extremely hard to design a multifamily project within the South Waterfront zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| This has been a challenge due to topography and unique parcel dimensions and shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| Specifically, in light of the SW2 code requirements regarding building frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| the shape of the new parcels along Waterfront Drive creates a natural hardship supporting the four variances which have been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| As city staff can confirm, our design team has fully satisfied the SW2 code requirements for our project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| with the exception of these four variances, which all relate to the road curvature on Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| We are asking that we be given flexibility on the SW2 road frontage requirements in these four locations across the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| which are shown as green shaded areas on the variance diagrams which we've sent to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| and we've reviewed previously with the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| We believe these variances are reasonable for three primary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| The curvature of Waterfront Drive does not fit the rectangular block model of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| Number two, the areas in question are oriented toward the river and away from residential homes, thus creating no harm to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| And number three, the variances also allow us to provide more green space on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| To meet the letter of the code, our buildings would need to expand into these green spaces shown on those diagrams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| Therefore, the position of our design team is that these variance requests be recognized as benign in regards to a negative impact on the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2719)|
| 0:45:27| and are reasonably justified due to the unique curvature of Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| This position has previously been supported by a unanimous BZA ruling on the variance request made on December 19th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| Our team has met numerous times with the Old Seward neighborhood over the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| including following a postponement of our first BZA hearing and most recently directly with the appellant on February 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| to discuss the project, the specific variances, and listen to neighborhood concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| During those meetings, no objections to the specific variances in question were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| Consistently, the concerns we heard were instead related to impacts of new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| such as parking, traffic, building heights, and changing river views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| While we could not agree to solve these non-variance-related issues in the way desired by some neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| we pointed out how our project design meets the code and includes elements designed to mitigate impacts to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| such as investment in covered parking, fitting within the city plan for new and improved right-of-ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| and extensive, attractive landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| As concerns about building heights and views have been a repeated concern voiced by the appellant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| Dominion's design team also provided additional conceptual and rendered views to help the appellant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| and any interested party better understand the future buildings and view corridors the project would generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| We are truly proud of the hard work that has gone into this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| and are extremely excited to have the opportunity to add to and invest in the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| To summarize once more, we believe the variances in question are reasonably justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| due to 1. the curvature of the waterfront drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| 2. the green space created by the variances in lieu of building footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| and 3. the areas in question are oriented away from neighboring residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| We therefore respectfully request that the City Council reaffirm BZA's previous unanimous approval of the four building frontage variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| Our architect, John Sanders, would be available if we had another time, but we can discuss that at a later point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you, Mr. Chalmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Mr. Kline, would you like to have up to five minutes to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| It sounds like we're here hearing the item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| and so now I don't know whether this council will postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| So it looks like I have to now respond, because he just made the whole argument for his variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| So I am here on behalf of the Old Severe Neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| a group of neighbors in the Old Severe Neighborhood with support from adjacent neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| and we've got a petition signed by over 600 people as well as the people that are here with green scarves on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| If you'd stand up and you know you're in support of the denial of this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| To get right to it, in hoping that there is, I guess, a postponement so I can organize my thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| because I thought there was going to be a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| the law of Tennessee, folks, is very clear about variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| Without a showing of hardship, you all have heard this concept, hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| There's no way to justify any variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| In this case, under this application, your applicant has not shown any hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| What limits your applicant's ability to develop their land according to the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| is their own proposed plan of development, a 230-unit multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| comprised of ten buildings and two commercial spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| This developer has many reasonable uses of this land available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| but what this developer is asking you to do is approve variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| that reduces the 75% frontage requirements on these lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| in order that the developer can build to their plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| not to overcome exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| or any other exceptional physical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| where strict application of the 75% front setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| A variance, according to your regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| shall be used only where necessary to overcome some physical condition of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| and the lack of such physical condition or what is termed by our ordinance a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| does not give the BZA or this quasi-judicial body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| the authority to grant these requested variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| It's that simple. There's no hardship here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| You might ask, how can this developer develop their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| The standard is to do what a reasonable developer of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| without the requested variances would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| and the answer most certainly is in the SW2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| which is where this falls, the jewel zone under our new suggested building types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| include duplex homes, townhouses, row houses, and multiple unit housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| with the newly landscaped shoreline experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| and a continuous riverfront setting along the river's edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Section 4.1 of the South Waterfront District SW2 at Section 4.13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| titled Property Development says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| These developments provide residents spectacular vistas of the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| but minimize obstructed views perpendicular to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| The curvature of the waterfront drive and the frontage requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| on all sides of the development are there to ensure that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| will meet the intent of the SW2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| My clients respectfully request that you deny the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| and you are the de novo reviewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| It's not that you're approving what BZA did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| You, under this rule, are the judges of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| You decide whether they have a hardship or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| They haven't shown you a hardship, so what can they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| They can put these big box buildings up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| but they can't reduce the 75% frontage requirement that is in the SW2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| They can still do it, and what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| If you've seen the photographs that they just proffered, I guess yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| if you've seen the photographs, you see what happens is you have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| ten buildings that go up and block the entire neighborhood's view of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| That's why the whole problem exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| They shouldn't be allowed a variance at all because there's no hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| Without a hardship, you don't have authority to grant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| That concludes statements from the appellee and appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Yeah, so as you can see, this issue is quite important for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| And so one of the primary reasons that we're going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| is because of the importance of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| This is one of the rare properties, the jewel, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| in the South Knoxville waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And so this matter is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| There were new renderings and new designs provided by the Dominion just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| And so in the effort to hear as much community input as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| I'm going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| There's substantial impact to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| The community is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| The community deserves to digest the new material that was provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| and requested by Dominion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| Okay, motion made to postpone for two weeks by Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Discussion, Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| Well, I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| First off, I haven't opened an email to look at anything that was provided to us by Dominion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| because that is how we have always handled appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| So I just wanted the community to know that, Mr. Klein and anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| Any emails that come to me on this agenda item I don't open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| because we're not supposed to review those in our quasi-judicial role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| So I'm not privy to those drawings and any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| So I guess is that how I should continue on while we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| if we do this postponement, is to not open those emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Well, as Mr. Klein appropriately mentioned, this is a quasi-judicial matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| City Council is sitting almost like judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| and there's not supposed to be ex parte communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| but when the matters, you're not supposed to have interaction on a one-on-one basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| with people who have an interest in the outcome of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| So what has been traditionally done, and Mr. Swanson can clarify if he wishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| after the agenda comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| parties can submit almost what is considered like a pretrial pleading in the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| and file something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| I believe there's something that was done recently on the item 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| I believe Mr. Klein will be doing something in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| What Dominion provided and what Mr. Klein may or may not have provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| I think that would be acceptable at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Mr. Swanson, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Mr. Frost is Council's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| I respect his role as Council's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| I used to be Council's attorney, but I'm not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Ms. Ryder, does that clarify things about whether you can open the e-mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| I'm a little confused still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| Mr. Frost, are you saying that they should or should not open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| and read the contents of the e-mail that's sent to all members of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| There is a Tennessee attorney's general opinion that talks about parties being given procedural due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3338)|
| 0:55:48| and it's the fairness that each party is supposed to be afforded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| So it works for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| I mean, Council is interested in the fairness of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| That was not a yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| I think Council members are asking for guidance on whether they're allowed to read new information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| presented by either party as long as it's shared with all members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| I think it's been my understanding that it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| well, Mr. Klein wants to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| I'm not allowed to recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Yes, I talked with Mr. Frost several weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| and we decided that we would follow the attorney general opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| and that means no ex parte communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| I specifically instructed my people not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| although I don't have control over everybody's e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| And I apologize to everyone who might think that we're not answering your e-mails on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| It's just that we're not to open them and read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| I haven't been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| But in the past, if both parties agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| and so I'm not opening the e-mails unless Mr. Klein, as the representative of this group, says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| I bless for you to look at this information in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Now, if you guys are going to have meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| and Councilman Smith is going to be involved in those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| then everybody, you guys are all privy to it, and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| In the meantime, until I'm told otherwise, I'm not looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I don't think Mr. Smith should attend those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Let me clarify one item, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| Part of the request, so this item was postponed back in January 28th for four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| and part of the request is that the two parties meet, the two parties met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| At the meeting, one of the parties requested additional information from the other party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| and that's exactly what I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| And so one of the reasons for a two-week postponement is for the other party to receive that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| and digest it according to what they've requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| And so that is the primary purpose of the two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| Well, just the issue I wanted to bring up is similar to what Councilwoman Ryder brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| I read the packet that was sent to me before today's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| and I do think with a postponement we do need to be clear on our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3486)|
| 0:58:15| or lack thereof to engage with the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| And I realize, you know, Mr. Smith is new to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| and was not sworn in when he attended that public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| but it's a bit uncomfortable that the packet I received said that you toured the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| with the developers after the public meeting, which is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| I don't know if the community has had that opportunity to tour that area with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| So I live in that neighborhood, and so I'm very familiar or not in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| but in the extended community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| There was a suggestion in the meeting that everyone can go walk the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| and some folks chose not to and some folks chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Members of the Old Sevier neighborhood who are here tonight joined that same walk along the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| Again, there's a little bit of dynamic of me being 48 hours into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| I was a resident and a caring citizen 48 or 72 hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| and so there was neighborhood representatives and members of the Dominion team that walked that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3557)|
| 0:59:28| Okay, so the motion on the floor is to postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Motion to postpone carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| 10B is a resolution approving an appeal by John K. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| on behalf of the Tennessee Right to Life Education Fund, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to approve a variance to reduce the minimum parking setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| as fully described herein, for property located at 710 North Cherry Street, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3600)|
| 1:00:10| Is there a motion to approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| So, Council, I've been told that the normal way of hearing these appeals is that the appellant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| has the opportunity to go first, and up to three speakers, each speaker gets up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| and then after those speakers, the appellee has an opportunity to have up to three speakers, five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| and then the appellant has two minutes, up to two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| So, unless I hear otherwise from Council, that's why I'm proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| So, appellant is represented by Mr. King, and is it just going to be one speaker tonight, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| or is there more than one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| We'll have more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| More than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Well, we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| You start by saying your name for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| Don't start the five minutes yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| I'm first going to ask that someone make a motion to postpone this matter for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3668)|
| 1:01:19| I'm a late comer to this case in that I got hired after the BZA decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| and I've been working diligently since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| but I haven't yet gotten all the history in regard to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| that I think I need to more adequately represent my client in opposing what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Let me ask Council members, is there anyone who wishes to postpone this for Mr. King's desire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| Seeing none, Mr. King, we'll start the clock over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Would you start the clock over, please, whoever is doing the clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| If you would, Dan, you can go ahead and distribute those things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3722)|
| 1:02:12| You've already had a bit of a taste as to what's involved in particular proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| It's over, again, the granting of variance by BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| Mr. Kline gave you a thumbnail, if you will, of what's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| I'm going to take off from there and talk more about this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| This is a straightforward land use issue and a zoning matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| and that's what we will be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| I did not request the big crowd to be here in support of my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| I don't know what the other side did, but that's how I view this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| and that's how I'm going to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| A variance is not just to be given because someone has a problem with using their property the way they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3790)|
| 1:03:21| The state legislature, the state of Tennessee, gives the city a grant of certain zoning powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| and included in that grant are the standards that the state says must govern variance requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3809)|
| 1:03:40| The Tennessee Code, and now these two lawyers up there, their eyes are going to glaze over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| when I start quoting from the Green Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| Tennessee Code, annotated 13.7.201, is that grant of authority to the cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3830)|
| 1:04:00| It authorizes at 13.7.205, it authorizes the appointment of a BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3840)|
| 1:04:11| setting the membership at five members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| and it is to perform certain functions and according to certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| Those powers of the BZA are set forth in 13.7.207,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3860)|
| 1:04:27| and it includes their consideration of requests for variances in specified instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3867)|
| 1:04:36| At 13.7.207, and now I'm going to quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| at the time of enactment of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| or other extraordinary and exceptional situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| or consideration of such a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| the strict application of any regulation enacted under this part and Part 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| to or an exceptional or undue hardship upon the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| and a variance from strict application of that is such as to relieve those difficulties or hardships, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3937)|
| 1:05:52| There are appellate court cases that have interpreted this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| One of them is a 1977 Court of Appeals case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| and it says that the BZA is not authorized to grant variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| where the only hardship to an owner is the result of a condition not in the land itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| but in a structure created or altered by an owner of the property in violation of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3973)|
| 1:06:21| Pecuniary loss is insufficient to justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| What happened here is this applicant wants to double the size of their operation at that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3987)|
| 1:06:36| In order for them to do that, they have to add some additional parking and some additional driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| which they can't do and meet the standards of the ordinance, so they ask for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| In short, it's a request for a variance because we want to double the size of our existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4009)|
| 1:06:59| That is not a basis for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| The price of property is rectangular and flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Is there another speaker who wishes to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| They have up to five minutes if they're ready to come speak at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| I'd like to call on Mr. David Harbin, wherever he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| I ask that he review the proposed construction to see if there were other issues or problems in addition to or other than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4050)|
| 1:07:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Mr. Next speaker, please approach the podium and start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| Then you will have up to five minutes to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| It won't be five minutes, just real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| My name is David Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| I am a civil engineer and land surveyor here in Knoxville at 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| I've been doing site planning for the better part of 30 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| At the request of Mr. King, I was able to review the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| Basically, I'll move this over here so I can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| The variances, there's basically three variances here or two variances that were granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| The yellow portion here is an existing driveway that we could not find anywhere where that variance was actually granted in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4102)|
| 1:08:31| They've been using that probably outside of the code for the last, well, however long the building has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| What they've asked this time through the DZA was a variance to allow that driveway to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| This little green portion right here is part of their driveway that they are going to plan on building this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| In order to construct that, they also need a variance to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| The variance that they're asking for, since this property is adjacent to residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| it's on the same block, any part of the parking lot must be at least 25 feet away from the right-of-way line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4143)|
| 1:09:13| You see both in the existing portion and in the proposed portion, both of those do not meet the current zoning standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4153)|
| 1:09:21| They sought relief through the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| Upon review of this drawing that was applied, found one more variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| It's not much, but still it did not meet the standards of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| or, I'm sorry, City of Knox Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| Since this is a residentially zoned property, the parking lot must be at least 15 feet away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4179)|
| 1:09:47| It met it almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| It's right here to the front side of the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| It says it's 15.1 feet, but if you add the curb to it, that's 6 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| It's really about 14, about 14.5 feet away from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| So, to be in compliance, the parking lot for the first six or seven lots, parking spaces right here, would not be compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| That was not addressed through the BZA application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| That came before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| So, for Mr. King, when I reviewed the site plan, those were the deficiencies that I was able to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| Thank you, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Is there another speaker on behalf of the appellant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4221)|
| 1:10:31| If you could approach the podium and state your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| My name is Glenn Wyatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| I live at 2611 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| I've lived there for the past 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| I've seen a lot of change in that section of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| We have a pretty tight-knit neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| It's changed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| I want to say it's improved a lot over the last 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| I want to thank the mayor and the previous mayor for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I was out there this afternoon visiting my neighbors, and we had law enforcement making, I guess, an arrest up the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| They had their weapons out, and they went into one of the houses up two doors from Harrison Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| My issue is not with Planned Parenthood, and I appreciate the people who come out and support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| I've tried to be a good neighbor, will continue to be a good neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| and I just hate to see the city approve a variance that's going to allow them to have three access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| They come in off of Cherry Street, and it's a Cherry Street address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| You wouldn't know it by the building because the building faces Washington Avenue at Washington and Cherry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| and that's across the street there with a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| And the median comes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| If you're not familiar with Cherry Street, there's a median that goes all the way down to Woodbine, and that's the next access over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4306)|
| 1:11:54| Anyway, they have access to Cherry Street and at Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| If this variance is approved, they're going to have access to the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| The alley is 10 foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| I've measured it at several points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| My property line runs right up to the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| There's utility poles back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| In fact, a few years back when they had to bring in more cable for their Internet, they dug up my property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| They put it back, and that was fine, but there was just not much room back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| In fact, the lady that rents the apartment from me at the back, it's a separate cottage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| It sits back to the back part of the property at the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| She often uses that space at the alley for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| You know, she straddles a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| There's a drainage ditch there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| I won't get into the drainage problem with this, but there's going to be drainage problems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| But the main problem I have with it is by doubling the square footage and having the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| which is an area now that's grass, the proposal is to bring all that traffic to the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| The alley is not one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| It's two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| The city uses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| People come down, and we have quite a bit of foot traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| There's not a lot of vehicular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| There's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| I use the alley as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| In fact, I used it yesterday to bring some siding in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| But to approve this I think is a big, big mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| The last few days I got out, and I met some of the neighbors around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| I know there's a lot of names on this petition, and I appreciate them signing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| but they don't live in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| I live there, and there's 13, maybe 15 houses on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4410)|
| 1:13:37| There's some vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| If you go up to Harrison, Harrison has one, two, three houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| They're all opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| On Washington Avenue, there's two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| They're opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| And then when you go to the 2700 block, those people oppose it at 2700 in Harrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| and also at Woodbine, I mean at 2700 in Harrison and 2700 in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| But there's a lot of people in that neighborhood that aren't in favor of this revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4443)|
| 1:14:11| or of this variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| When I walked the neighborhood, there was one gentleman that lived three doors up from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| I hadn't met him before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| His name was Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| I don't know his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| He moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| He said he was going to try to buy the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| And I said, well, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| He was painting his front door pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| And I said, well, I hope for the rains that latex paint will dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| He's painting it for his little girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| He was the only one that kind of he said he was from up in New York or somewhere, I think he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| he wanted to investigate what the variance was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| But he was supportive of Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| I'm not against Planned Parenthood as I stand here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| And I wrote the mayor a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| And I said I'd continue to be a good neighbor, and I'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| Whatever decision you all make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| One minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Do you have any questions of me, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| This is our opportunity to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| The opportunity to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| And so, anyway, I guess that's it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| I oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| My wife, she wasn't here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| I think I'm the only one here, in fact, tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Some of my neighbors I talked to this afternoon, they have other things going on, and I do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| I'm retired, a little bit older than probably most of the people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| Whether I look it or not, I just turned 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| But, anyway, they asked me to let them know how things went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| So I think I'm the only one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I know there's some people here behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| And I guess other than the people that work over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| I don't have any problem with people that work over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| I used to have a little problem with people throwing their cigarette butts out and stuff, but they quit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| Thank you very much, Mr. Wyatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| And congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| So now we have the appellee has the opportunity to have three speakers, or up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| Each speaker can speak to the council for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4559)|
| 1:16:08| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| Mark Jendrick, 800 South Gay Street, Knoxville, 37929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| And I'm having some materials passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| The last page of the packet that says notes for city council is an aerial image of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| which I think makes it a whole lot easier to understand what's going on than trying to understand it in the abstract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| You're also getting a set of the permits and approvals from 1988,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| when this original design for this property was permitted and approved with no variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| That's what's rolled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| We don't think there's a variance required now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| And I can take you through those definitions in the zoning ordinance and show why it's not required now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| but codes has said that the best way to do it would be apply for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| And so we've tried to do what they've asked us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| and we've gone through the variance process successfully at BZA and I hope successfully here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| I do have one technical issue with the appeal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| On the first page of the application for appeal from BZA, it says this is in Council District 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| but I do not think this is in Council District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| So I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Back in 1988, if you've gotten that little packet and you turn to that back page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| back in 1988 the configuration you see was approved and permitted for a medical clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| and you can see that on the rolled up documents you've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| you can see one zoning, which is the current zoning under which my client applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| because we did it back in 2019, and no variance was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| It was approved, it was built, it's been there for over 30 years functioning as designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| and the design is to keep traffic from driving out onto Cherry Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| cutting across two lanes of traffic if they want to go southbound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| and try to make a U-turn at Washington Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| you can't see the southbound traffic coming because of the topography of Cherry Street at Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| In any event, I'm worried about time, so I don't want to go through those definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| If you all want to ask me about that, I'm happy to walk you through that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| There are standards for a variance, absolutely there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| And Wayne, when he talked about those standards, misquoted him a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| but Wayne's not in my matter, so it doesn't bother me too much that that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| But the standards, one of the standards that's very important is there must be a beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| a deprivation of beneficial use of the land, and I want to explain how that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| It also says the variance will be used when necessary to overcome some obstacle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| which is preventing an owner from using his property as the zoning ordinance intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| I think Wayne said overcome a hardship, and that's not how the ordinance reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| The ordinance reads obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| In any event, on the sheet that I did pass out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| I have put down how we have met the four general requirements for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| It's not contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Literal enforcement will result in an unnecessary hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| The spirit of the ordinance will be observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Substantial justice will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| All of that's easily met and explained on that sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| The hardship comes in the ingress and egress to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| and it also comes in we can't improve that property without this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| If you follow code's interpretation, which we disagree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| we can't improve this property without this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| We don't want to put $1.5 million to $2 million into that building, into that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| and we're told we can't do it without this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| That's why we're here to ask you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| There was a case that this council heard back in the 1990s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| where a fellow on Broadway needed to expand his building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| and he couldn't do it without a variance for the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| This council gave him that variance because they said without the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| he was deprived of the beneficial use of his land, and that was a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| That got appealed by old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| Went to Chancery Court here in Tennessee, and the chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| and this is in your packet too, agreed that that was a substantial hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| Got appealed again to the Tennessee Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| My friend John was talking about the Tennessee Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| Thirty seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| They too said that that is a substantial hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| You can't expand it without that variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| and that variance was requesting a reduction of the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| We're not requesting a reduction of the setback on the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| where we're going to build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| It's to leave a driveway in place that's been in place for 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| and shouldn't need a variance in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Seven seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| Thank you, Mr. Jendrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Do you have any other speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| We have two others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| We have Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Please come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| and start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| You will have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| Morgan Wilson, 2534 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| I live a little over 600 feet from Planned Parenthood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| and I drive past them daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| I purchased my house over five years ago knowing they'd be my neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| and during this time I haven't experienced any disruption from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| I do notice how the protesters occasionally leave litter on the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| and park rather close to the intersection, but I support their right to protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| Planned Parenthood is a great neighbor that provides a lot of value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| to a community lacking in many important services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| I myself have been able to walk there for a routine exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| instead of driving all the way out west to my doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| I noticed the posted variance sign in early January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| and was curious about what the situation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| as there have been a lot of changes in our area recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| Under RECODE, a few properties along Terry Street went from residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| to see-in, joining other commercial properties near them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| A small strip mall across from Planned Parenthood sold in June for $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| This section of Terry Street is already distinguished pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| from a purely residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| I soon found out about Planned Parenthood's intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| to expand and renovate their building, which I wholeheartedly approve of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| Before the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| 36 of my neighbors representing 24 households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| signed a petition in support of Planned Parenthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| I don't think this proposed expansion will cause a massive influx of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| but new commercial developments in the area may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| It does not make any sense at all to me for a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| to have to stop the use of a driveway that was there before they bought the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| Traffic entering and exiting through a stoplight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| is safer than forcing unnecessary U-turns at Washington and Woodbine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| It's not like Terry Street is a quiet residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| It's a four-lane connecting a state highway with the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| and has a 40-mile-per-hour speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| In cases like this, if I saw there were a number of neighbors opposing such a thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| I would likely side with the people who live near it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| So I read over the opposition's arguments to see if I might agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| They address concerns I believe are well beyond the specific driveway issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| but I feel the need to address them as they were included in the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| The argument about the Magnolia Avenue corridor project doesn't seem to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| as I don't believe the project has had much of an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| on properties 1,500 feet from Magnolia so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| I saw that two pastors of two churches and three households had signed on in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| I do not see how any activities at 710 North Cherry impact these churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| as I assume they use their properties mostly on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| and as far as I know, Planned Parenthood keeps mostly Monday through Friday, 9 to 430 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| The closest parcel to the back of Planned Parenthood is a 50 by 150 vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| There is yet another empty lot between that and the first house you come to on Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| I might be concerned about setbacks on the eastern border of the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| but that's not the setback being considered here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| I saw a Tennessee Right to Life parcel signed on, and they are the entity who filed this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| I think we all know that you probably have different concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| about how an expansion will impact traffic patterns or infringe on local neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| From my research, their offices are three whole miles away from Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| In regards to use of the alley, we are all allowed use of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| According to ordinance, alleys are minor streets for vehicular access and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Some folks in my neighborhood use the alleys to access their parking pads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| so I see no reason as to why Planned Parenthood clients and staff would not also be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| reasonable use of an alley as long as traffic laws are obeyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| It might be an occasional inconvenience to share the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| but urban life requires us to live in cooperation with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Regarding property devaluation, I think it's hard to directly correlate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| to activities you don't personally agree with going on inside of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| But as I'm sure you've heard, property values have been increasing in the area in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Perhaps we can say access to education and health care increases property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| I try to pay attention to such issues facing our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| I do not understand very clearly the ins and outs of setbacks, thresholds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| parking lot drive aisle definitions, and other specifics of our ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| but I'm pretty sure I've seen properties get approved for variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| that seem more complex and more numerous than the one we are discussing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| I believe it was stated in the BZA minutes in the agenda packet that in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| the board members were only there to decide the location of the driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| so council only needs to consider whether or not you think the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| made the appropriate decision about the driveway, nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| The BZA agreed Planned Parenthood satisfied the four criteria for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| and I would think if you compared it to other such decisions you've upheld, you would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| As a neighbor, I would accept this decision no matter who the landowner was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| For example, if this was a right-to-life crisis pregnancy center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| or perhaps one of these churches wished to expand a needed use of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| that doesn't perfectly align with today's code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| As I write this, I know there's another BZA decision appeal on the agenda before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| as that seems way more complex and has probably taken a lot of council's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| though I do enjoy when decent numbers of actual residents band together to have their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| In the case of 17 North Cherry, I don't personally appreciate these unnecessary roadblocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| being thrown up simply due to a political agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| It's a waste of everyone's time and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| Thank you, Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| We have a speaker on behalf of the appellee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5185)|
| 1:26:34| Thank you for coming to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Please start by stating your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Sandra Korbelick, 5212 Daphne Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| I live in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| I'd like to spend a second introducing myself to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| I have a 37-year career in city planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| I have a master's in architecture and planning from UCLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| I am certified through the American Institute of Certified Planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| In my career, I have been senior staff to a board of zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| I have reviewed and interpreted zoning regulations, site plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| and I have also been a transportation planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| I come to you providing a planner's perspective on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| When a planner looks at interpreting regulation, we look at three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| We look at definition, we look at intent, and we look at safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| When we look at definition in this situation, remember we're looking at the old zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| The old code defined parking lot as the immediate parking area and driving aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| A driving aisle is the vehicular driving surface directly adjacent to parking space or stalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| The lane in question is not a parking aisle, not a parking stall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| It is not a parking aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| It connects the parking lot to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| It is therefore a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| Common sense tells you that driveways need to traverse the 25-foot setback in order to reach the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5291)|
| 1:28:20| Without a driveway, there is no access to a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| Let's move on to intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| The intent behind this regulation with a setback for parking lots and driving aisles is one of, I would say, aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5308)|
| 1:28:40| They want to keep parked cars out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| It's typically a residential front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| Cars are typically four feet or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| The applicant has removed the parking lot from the 25-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5331)|
| 1:28:59| Indeed, the driveway, sidewalk, paving stones, and pathways are all flat on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| They do not rise to the height of a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| Let's move on to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Vehicular accidents increase the turning movements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Planners encourage parking lots to have internal connectivity to avoid vehicles entering and exiting surface streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| This driveway provides safe movement between the front and the proposed back parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| Without the driveway, vehicles would have to exit one parking lot, drive down a street, turn onto another street to access the other back parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5371)|
| 1:29:42| Without this driveway, if the parking lot in the front is full, a vehicle would be required to turn 180 degrees in a 24-foot space in order to exit that parking lot and make all those turning movements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5382)|
| 1:29:57| As a transportation planner, we are well aware accidents and turning movements correlate almost directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5397)|
| 1:30:05| The more turning movements you have, the more that you require those vehicles to enter surface streets, make several turns to get to the back parking lot, you're increasing accident potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5405)|
| 1:30:17| Frankly, I would not have interpreted this regulation the way that the building codes has done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5417)|
| 1:30:25| But here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| I request that you approve the variance and we move forward with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| Appellant has two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| If you wish to speak, up to two minutes in rebuttal to the appellee's speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5444)|
| 1:30:54| Remember, as he said, this is a de novo hearing, so it's up to them to establish a case for granting this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| I think there's been serious doubt raised as to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| Mr. Jendrick said they got a permit for a medical clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| In your packet at tab six, you'll find sections of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5471)|
| 1:31:20| The first one being C1 Neighborhood Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5480)|
| 1:31:28| If you look at the second page, the closest they get to approving what's up here today is professional and business offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5488)|
| 1:31:57| Under the same ordinance, sections of the ordinance, you'll find the 01 Office Medical and Related Services District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5517)|
| 1:32:13| I don't know whether that's in your packet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| I'm not real sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| I'll pass it up to him when I get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Item four is to permit the use of medical, dental offices, and clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5541)|
| 1:32:29| Statutory interpretation says that deals with the subject specifically as a medical clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5549)|
| 1:32:40| Since it is in the O Zone and not otherwise in the C1 Zone, you would say that it's not authorized in the C1 Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5560)|
| 1:32:52| I don't know why it was done, but it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| We're still here today dealing with a request for variances that aren't authorized under the law of the state of Tennessee and under the law in the ordinance for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5577)|
| 1:33:16| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| I ask that you reject the request for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5598)|
| 1:33:28| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Council members, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| So, Mayor, I'd like to ask Mr. Ahrens if he could give a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5618)|
| 1:33:46| I know we've heard a lot of commentation and arguments on both sides, but could you just give us just a brief overview as it relates to what was presented and what was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5626)|
| 1:34:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| You could just state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Peter Ahrens, Department of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| Under the previous code, if a property owner or applicant met a certain threshold, the entire parking lot needed to be upgraded to meet current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5647)|
| 1:34:18| So, whether that's an addition, whether that was a renovation, it was a very firm threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| This applicant met that threshold, so our staff evaluated the entire parking lot for compliance under the code and identified what you're seeing as the only deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5665)|
| 1:34:42| That's how they got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| What other questions can I answer for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| Council members, Vice Mayor McKenzie, do you have more questions for Mr. Ahrens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| Yeah, just a quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| So, it was determined that they were under a hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| Yes, the Board of Zoning Appeals recognized a hardship and granted the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| So, there's been a lot of issue – oh, I have a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| There's been a lot of issue made about doubling the size of the building, size of the building, size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| They are still within conformance of lot coverage, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| All of the new construction meets the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| The purpose of that variance request was to recognize a pre-existing non-conforming condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5727)|
| 1:35:34| Okay, and the building, which if I remember the facts stated tonight correctly, was built around 1981?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5734)|
| 1:35:41| I'm not sure, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| 1988, but it was done with a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| To the best of my knowledge, ma'am, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Okay, so it is existing in terms of the zoning questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| It would be existing non-conforming, and we're not having a change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| So, we are not having a zoning discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| And then – and I'll just comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| We have existing non-conforming uses in zoning areas all over the place from past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5772)|
| 1:36:20| and none of us were here when that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| so we don't have to force people to stop what they're doing because their zoning isn't in compliance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| I'd like to ask Mr. Hagerman a question, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| So sorry to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Could you briefly explain to me –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| I know there's a lot of rules that I've been through with some of the engineering staff before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| about driveway distances from intersections and corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| I've had conversations with Mr. Branham, and maybe he's the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| but, you know, I know there's some rules, especially that get flagged in Long Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5815)|
| 1:37:03| about not having driveways intersect within a certain number of feet of an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| Jim Hagerman, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| I am not prepared to answer that question specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| I can get that information back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Actually, Peter may know better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Again, Peter Ahrens, plans review and building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| When staff evaluated that, that would have been –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| if any of those driveway access points were non-compliant with the standards of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| they would have been identified as needing a variance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| And they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| So I feel safe to say that all of the access points meet the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5857)|
| 1:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| Thank you, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Ms. Fugate, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| So let me thank everyone who showed up today to speak on behalf of this issue and this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5876)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you for all of the documentation and the research that went into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| that you shared with council for our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| Looking at everything that we have before us, hearing the arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| also that they actually meet all the requirements, they meet the hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| I'm of the opinion the variance request should be allowed because of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| for strict application of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| I do agree that it appears that it would be a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| I think allowing the requested variance is not contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| The variance request is a minimum adjustment for reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| Therefore, I do not support the appeal, and I would like to move to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| There's a motion made to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| There's a motion made to deny the appeal and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| Any further discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| Seeing none, all those in favor of the motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| The appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5951)|
| 1:39:22| Today is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with ECG Moss Grove SLP LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5962)|

| 1:39:53| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| I was going to say, is Ms. Wade here to give us any details of what's the time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| These are additional units that I believe we, I don't think I'm familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| This is a new development in West Knoxville, 192 units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6009)|
| 1:40:18| I believe the time frame for closing on this is later this spring, closing on the financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| and then construction should start in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| But John Shepard from Elmington Capital Group is here if you want more specific information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6028)|
| 1:40:38| Mr. Shepard, did you want more specific information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| What's your time frame on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| What are the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| When will you begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| That type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| John Shepard, 118 16th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| The plan is to, as Becky said, close on the financing next month, actually start construction in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| and deliver buildings January 2022 is I believe the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| And you guys are using kind of a, you're using this funding from the city, other tax credits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| So it's a mix of this funding from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| There is an allocation of federal housing tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| which we have monetized with our investment partner, SunTrust, now Truist Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6079)|
| 1:41:27| who's utilizing those federal tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| And then a loan through Fannie Mae and tax-exempt bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| So that's the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| In understanding our review process before projects are approved, do we require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6101)|
| 1:41:50| sorry this isn't really a question for you, but do we require that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6110)|
| 1:42:00| all necessary zoning and permitting and all of that is in place before we award funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| or will that be another step in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| Everything's in place for this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| We look at the financing of a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| but we really cannot move forward until the zoning and plans are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| So sometimes we do conditional approval for a project, but we really can't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| We can't bring it to the council until everything's in place with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Mr. Shepherd, can you talk to us a little bit about the type of housing we're dealing with here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| I know the property on Hollywood was workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| Is this the same type of housing we're talking about here, or is this something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| It's generally the same type of housing in that it is affordable and workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6176)|
| 1:43:04| To not get too technical, but there's a little bit broader skewing of income distributions in this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| in terms of who our target residents are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| and that's a result of some recent changes in the federal tax code that have allowed developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| to implement more mixed income type developments and integrate that in their development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6197)|
| 1:43:25| which we like, our residents like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| The evidence is that it leads to better outcomes for schools and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| and the communities that those developments are located in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| So that was definitely a feature of Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| It's just been magnified here as a result of recent changes in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| But in general, we're talking about, yes, workforce, affordable housing, just like Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| So you're talking about households in Knoxville who are workers making anywhere from $10 to, call it, $25 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6233)|
| 1:44:06| that kind of range, which is a pretty broad dispersal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| So we've got 32 units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| How many units outside of that? Is it 160?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| That's right. So the entire development is 192 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Every unit in the development is affordable or workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| The city's restrictions for the affordable rental development funds only attach to 32 of those 192 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6267)|
| 1:44:36| And there's a similar mechanism in the Pond Gap development where the city is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6276)|
| 1:44:46| incentivizing the entire development, and none of the development would happen without it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| but only needed to attach its deed restrictions and long-term monitoring restrictions to a smaller subset of the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6291)|
| 1:45:02| So we've got 192 units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Okay. I just want to say I support this, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Did we move approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6314)|

| 1:47:21| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| I was just looking at the additional cost is about sealcoat to two parking lots within Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| I just had questions about I've gone through there, and it's in better shape than a lot of other park areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| so I was wondering why this one is being worked on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| Mr. Brace or Mr. Hagerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Yeah, I think these lots, the ceiling oftentimes is about protecting what's there to help prevent further decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| Since these are in average condition, sealing them now so that we don't have to add paving later is really a preventative measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| And then the road, as you're aware of, is in really deplorable condition right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| and so this is to get a couple of inches of asphalt on that road until further improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| I think the Lakeshore Park LLC and the city are still determining where the road actually needs to be in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| but during that two- to three- to four-year window, we need to get some asphalt on it now because we're spending so much time patching that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6494)|
| 1:48:22| Just wondering, how is it decided to work on this one when I'm thinking that there are other places, other parks that have more issues than this does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6502)|
| 1:48:31| Well, we've got our facilities paving program, so we try to look at issues throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| and so we could talk about other projects that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| The Lakeshore folks and our Parks and Rec folks identified this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| and so we went out and looked at it, and again, the sealing is really about preventing further decline and damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| If we can get a sealer on it now, we can prevent damage later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| Again, asphalt damage is when you have cracks, and then water gets in those, it freezes and expands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| So it was a request to come look at those lots and seal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| I think the majority of this cost is getting the paving on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| The sealing is, again, a preventative measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| And if there's other parking lots that we need to look at, let me know, and we'll go look at those and try to work them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| It's a mix of this contract, and also our Public Service Department does do work with their paver and their crews as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement with the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| for a safer and complete streets study for an estimated project cost of $250,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| with $200,000 federally funded and $50,000 funded by the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Mr. Hagerman, I just have a quick question, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| So we've approved a couple of things already to look at things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| specific intersections for better walkability, cycling access, which this will look at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6602)|
| 1:50:11| We've looked at Rutledge and Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| That's in progress right now, and, of course, Broadway and Hall of Fame intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| What will this be looking at, other areas or specific arterials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| This is looking at collectors mostly throughout the city that are substandard narrow streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6626)|
| 1:50:35| I'm sure you have your favorites, but I forgot to bring my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| Oh, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| There's a lot of streets throughout the city that are, like, under 20 feet and 16 feet that are collectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6642)|
| 1:50:50| and they get a fair amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| So mostly we look at that pile of problems and say it's just too big to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6653)|
| 1:51:01| So what the original concept was to look at those and start doing some priorities with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6661)|
| 1:51:10| but also if you're going to rebuild the street and fix that kind of structural issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| it gives you the opportunity to look at bike and pedestrian facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| So this study will also be informed by the bike plan and the sidewalk plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6680)|
| 1:51:27| which is bike plan was done a few years ago and sidewalk plan is soon to be complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6687)|
| 1:51:35| So that's the concept behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| So when we look at Hall of Fame, well, the other projects where we've approved pots of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| to specifically look at Hall of Fame, Broadway, or Rutledge and Asheville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| those are things that rise to the top and we're paying specific attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Is this going to focus on what you're saying are smaller arterials that kind of look at a comprehensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| Yes, arterials and collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| These are more minor and more dispersed issues throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6725)|
| 1:52:13| And this will enable us to prioritize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| Prioritizing and just get started on this big pile of old farm roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6736)|
| 1:52:23| that had a bunch of development buildup around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| and really nobody ever looked at them since and they cause various safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| and it will take a lot of resources to fix even one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6753)|
| 1:52:42| So I think it's important to look at all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| and figure out which one is the most important and start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| So will they end up being prioritized in a list much like the old sidewalk plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| That is my expectation, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you, Ms. Ryder. Thank you, Mr. Hagerman. Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Just briefly, I see that out of the $250,000 cost, $200,000 is coming from federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| Remind me what particular program from the federal government is allotting us that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| Boy, you got me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| Do you know which program it comes from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| There's a pile of different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| Does this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| If we can't get it tonight, we'll e-mail that out to all of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| You know, the point I guess I was really making was that this is heavily contributed to by federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6816)|
| 1:53:44| and not from the city coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| And one point to make here is this just makes the funding available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| This is the first step in a long process, so don't expect anything to be happening soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6835)|
| 1:54:03| We have this next step once the contracting process is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| Then we go out for requests for qualifications to consultants, and that takes a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6848)|
| 1:54:17| So this won't really get kicked off for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Thank you, Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Mr. Thomas, our city council attorney has the answer to your question about what program in the federal government this money is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| On page 497, it's the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Just need to stay in contact with that program and see if there's any more available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| Okay. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| and, if awarded, accept a grant from the East Tennessee Human Resource Agency in the amount of $11,680,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6902)|
| 1:55:10| with a required 50% match by the city in the amount of $11,680 for the purpose of funding an improved apprentice mechanic program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6910)|
| 1:55:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| If there's someone who could maybe just give a brief overview of the apprentice mechanic program for those in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| and those watching, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| Mr. Bradshaw, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Nicholas Bradshaw, Department of Fleet Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| There's obviously a well-documented crisis in recruiting for the skilled trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| which affects fleet services significantly because about half of our 55 employees are mechanics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| automotive or diesel technicians, which is skilled trades in very high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| We've tried to take some creative approaches to deal with our recruiting crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| and one of those approaches has been to partner with some of our local partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| We're in a very lucky position out at our Lorain Street complex that our neighbors are the Tennessee College of Applied Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| and then, on the other side, the American Job Center, so didn't have to get too creative there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| But we were able to partner with faculty and staff at the Tennessee College of Applied Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| to make some connections in their diesel and automotive technician programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| and then work with our neighbors on the other side at the American Job Center with grant programs that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| to fund some of those students and recent graduates to come work in our shop and be compensated through grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6991)|
| 1:56:39| We've been going with this program for about a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| We've brought four students on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| All of them have been paid for entirely through grant funding, which has been a wonderful experience for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| Two of them have finished their apprenticeship programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| It's about a four-month apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| They've completed that, did very well, and they've since been hired on as permanent city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| so it's become a pipeline for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Another of the four apprentices is currently working with us as a temporary employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| so that's three out of four have been added to the payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| What we're looking to do, because this grant is 100% paid for through the American Job Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| the city's not paying any of it, it's a very competitive grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| and there's a lot of strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| It's difficult to get new candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| What we're looking for is to expand the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| That program is the WIOA program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| It's a work experience program for at-risk youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| We're looking to add a second component to our apprentice program, which is still funded through the WIOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| but it's a different program for youth on-the-job training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| The on-the-job training program is a 50-50 match program where the city hires the technician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| which is good for us because the other apprentices that we have have been paid for through the American Job Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| They've not been city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| There are certain restrictions that they can't operate city vehicles, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| So by bringing the employees on board as city employees, it helps us, one, expand the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| help more disadvantaged, at-risk youth who are trying to join the skilled trades and better our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| help Knoxville by adding capacity, and I think it's a win-win really for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7092)|
| 1:58:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| So I appreciate the overview and always support and encourage apprenticeship and on-the-job training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| Actually, I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| First question, I had a conversation a couple of months ago with Chad West about fleet services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7114)|
| 1:58:42| and there being a requirement that mechanics have their own tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| and he said that was something that you all are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| Yeah, well, it's an industry standard, not just with the city and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| It's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| It's really a barrier to entry for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, as you can well imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| The outlay, the capital outlay to have your own set of tools is often in the tens of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| even for new mechanics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Your experienced mechanics can have $40,000, $50,000 in tools or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| It's a barrier to entry for sure, and it's something we've been working to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| What we have done in recent years is enact a personal tool allotment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| which is funded through the city, which we fought for two years ago, I suppose, which we're very happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| But that's basically a $700 stipend of sorts they get every year to be used towards the purchase of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| It's not nearly enough, but it is more than it was, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| So it's progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| We'd love to increase that more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Again, it's a barrier to entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| These students will enter the profession with a load of debt, not uncommon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| but they typically have more debt tied into their tools, which they need to do to ply their trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| than they do in their student loans, which is a debt that we're all more familiar with probably here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| But, yeah, it's a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| It's something we're working to overcome, and it is a contributing factor to the recruiting crisis, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| and it also hinders us from reaching into other markets, reaching a disadvantaged population in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| and the surrounding area and having a bigger recruiting pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| The second issue I wanted to bring up is not necessarily a question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| but it's a concern because this is the second department that we have coming before us who are having issues recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7228)|
| 2:00:38| who are also having stories in the news about employees not feeling like they can speak out in their department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7238)|
| 2:00:47| and feel like they are being retaliated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| And I think that that's very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| I don't think that that is something we can throw money at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| If there's a culture of fear that we're developing among our employees, that needs to be addressed directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7258)|
| 2:01:07| and that's something, just as we're talking about ways to improve recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| that would be an important piece that we address directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| A follow-up question after hearing about the challenges with the participants in this program having to supply their own tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7280)|
| 2:01:30| So the $700 stipend, does that afford them the at least minimum amount of tools to be able to successfully participate in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7290)|
| 2:01:42| or do they require a lot more money to be able to fully engage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| Luckily, we have a partnership with the American Job Center, as I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| All the apprentices that we have brought on board have been clients of the American Job Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| They have another program for disadvantaged students to get tools, a separate tool program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| So the apprentices that we have been able to bring on board had tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| and they were provided by the American Job Center through a separate grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| The $700 stipend that I mentioned before is for all fleet permanent civil service employees, which is something we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7332)|
| 2:02:20| We're not going to let a lack of tools be an obstacle for an apprentice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| Luckily, because we have this partnership with the American Job Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| who also have other programs to help these disadvantaged students, that partnership has worked really well so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| and we've not had any issues with these students not having tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| They also can't be students at TCAT without tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| You have to have tools to build a – it's an on-the-job training program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| So they have their tool situation, at least a starter tool set, when they enter the program at TCAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| So that is the box that they bring with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| We just move it to our shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| Well, they'll do 32 hours with us, one night a week at TCAT so they can continue their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| It dovetails right in there with their co-op program that they have already at TCAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| Vice Mayor, I do want to say that we are exploring ways to address that barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| And Nick and the fleet team, Mr. Bradshaw and the fleet team, it would be much cheaper for us to help eliminate that barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7396)|
| 2:03:23| get folks on board, train them and keep them and retain them than it would be to not access them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| So we are looking at that barrier, and I think you'll see something over the next couple of budgets to try to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| Thank you, Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| This is something that's true throughout the trades, that I think most trade people need to have their tools by their own tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7420)|
| 2:03:50| And it's interesting that that's still going on when we have such an issue with getting people into the trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| Just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| Thank you, Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| I just wanted to commend Mr. Bradshaw for your initiative on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| This is a really great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| It very much meets the huge need not just for the city but for the job opportunities that you're creating to people who might not otherwise have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7447)|
| 2:04:16| When I worked for the city a few years ago, you were also a leader on the Equity Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| and also in creating the Second Chance Program, which helps give job opportunities to formerly incarcerated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7461)|
| 2:04:29| And now you're leading the charge and taking the initiative and leading this innovative program as Deputy Director of Fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| So I just want to thank you for thinking outside the box and doing good things for the city as an employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| and drawing in new people to the skilled trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| That's really good stuff, and I'm glad to have this on the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7493)|

| 2:05:35| You're opposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7536)|

| 2:06:01| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| Ms. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| We have speakers signed up to speak to this, so then we'll listen to that and come back to you right after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7573)|
| 2:06:20| Mr. Bruce Fangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7580)|
| 2:06:33| Bruce Fangler, 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I also am the CEO of the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| Mayor Kincannon, Vice Mayor McKenzie, members as well as City staff and citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| I speak tonight in favor of the ordinance of 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| In Volunteer Ministry Center's desire to add more permanent supportive housing in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7610)|
| 2:06:58| the closing of Myrtle Street is a piece of that development puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| Though a small parcel of land, it helps us with our THDA low-income housing tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| as well as provide a few more units there at 1501 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| Adding new units, I admit, will require rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| and I look forward to both the community conversations in process to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7639)|
| 2:07:25| But finally, I am grateful for the community conversation that we had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| Many thanks to you, Vice Mayor McKenzie, for calling it, and also the facilitation by Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7650)|
| 2:07:37| I've learned a lot, and I hope that we can continue the conversation of making this project a very successful one in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7657)|
| 2:07:44| The only thing that I would add, may I simply ask the question, will this be on emergency reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7664)|
| 2:07:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| Thank you, Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| The next person to speak on this is Mr. James Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7675)|
| 2:08:03| If you could start by just stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| James Waldrop, 1710 East 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| I signed up earlier this afternoon because I hadn't heard anything from the meeting we had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| Thank you again, Ms. McKenzie, for arranging that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| During that meeting, you apologized for not calling such meetings sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| but I'd like to just let you know that we really don't think it's your job to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| and the city should have been on the ball a little bit better, but we do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| I signed up to speak just because I didn't know what the conditions were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| if anything in the meeting that we had the other week was carried over into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| So it seems that it has, after asking around, it seems that that is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7722)|
| 2:08:49| So I hope we can take this time to have this project go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| but with much more clarity and partnership with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| So far, it seems like we've been a population to be subjugated by an occupying force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| and it's hard to be good neighbors with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| So just going forward, we'd appreciate if conversations can be had with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| and we can see what the plans are, because like it was said in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| it costs money to change the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| And if we have a two-way conversation at the very start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| we can avoid all of the drama and setbacks of the last year over this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7761)|
| 2:09:28| I mean, it is regretful that in our society some of the tactics that were used were necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| including personal attacks on people and other things that were said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| such as calling an entire group of people nasty for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| But hopefully resetting this, we can all go forward together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| and be clear on exactly what is being planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| And it can happen before the rezoning gets to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| and before everything ends up in appeals or lawsuits or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| If we just have the conversation at the front from this point forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| I think this will go much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| Thank you, Mr. Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| That concludes all the speakers who signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| Vice Mayor, I know that we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| I have an amendment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| And just to be clear, it will be Section 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| which is the closure of the right-of-way as provided in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| shall occur strictly contingent upon the adjacent property owned by Positively Living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| being conveyed to the Volunteer Ministry Center for the creation of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Vice Mayor McKenzie has offered an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| Is there a second on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| The amendment has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| It includes a contingency, and is it an emergency ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| No, I also want to have it on emergency as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| Do we need a separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| I think we'll vote twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| Two amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| So the first amendment we're considering is about a contingency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| which she just read out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| Are there any questions about that added language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Do you have it all before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| Ms. Fugate, a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| My question is that so the agreement is only if Positively Living gets it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| will we change the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| Otherwise, we don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Only if VMC gets it from Positively Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| Yeah, VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| But, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| I just don't understand why we're not doing it regardless, but that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7887)|
| 2:11:34| If that's the compromise, I'm in the spirit of the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| Thank you, Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| Ms. Welch wanted to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| She was facilitating the meeting that only a few of us were able to make, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| Thank you so much, Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| and thank you again to Vice Mayor McKenzie for convening that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| and for all the community members who showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| and really engaged in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| One of the requests at the meeting from the community was to make the transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7919)|
| 2:12:06| or the actual closure of the road contingent on the sale of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| for the purpose of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| I think the city's perspective is that we don't have an interest in that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| but I think that was a very acceptable compromise to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| and so the law department kindly looked into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| and came up with a draft for Vice Mayor McKenzie to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| And also VMC was consulted, and I see Dr. Spangler nodding his head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| so I think we just felt like that was a good path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| and we appreciated everybody coming forward with good faith to come to that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| And so just so Council is aware, Mr. Spangler was in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| We did close that meeting with mutual agreement from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| as well as Mr. Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| I appreciate everyone who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| I do want to say I felt like that was an extremely productive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| I think that go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| I would like for us to not rehash the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| because I think that we made a lot of progress in that last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| We all know what the past has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| and it has not been very pretty between community and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| So moving forward, I think I'd like to ask that we all put that behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| We have a new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| We have a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| We have new council members who are highly engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| and appreciate the community's receptiveness to the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| And as we move forward, I would just ask that we just stay positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| and not look backward from this point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| And so I just appreciate everyone, and thank you again, Stephanie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| for facilitating the meeting and for everyone that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| Because for such short notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| I think we had about 30 or 35 people in pouring down rain last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| and so I think that speaks just to the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| and the engagement of the Park Ridge community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| which we totally appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| So we're voting on the amendment that adds the contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Seeing none, all those in favor of this amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| The amendment carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Vice Mayor McKenzie, do you have a second amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| So second amendment would be that we are hearing this on emergency reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| so I move to approve on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| Motion made to amend it to read it on emergency, and it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| Seeing none, all those in favor of this amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| The amendment carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| Going back to the original motion as amended twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| are there any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| Oh, the motion, amended motion passes 9-0 for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| It has to have at least six, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| We did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| And thank you to Vice Mayor McKenzie for convening the community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| Thank you to Stephanie Welch for helping facilitate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| and thank you to the members of the community and neighborhood and VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| for participating in it and coming up with a compromise so we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| 12C is an ordinance approving the request of Marty Norton for an amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| the North City Sector Plan from low-density residential to light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| for property located at 3313 and 3309 Mill Road, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8133)|
| 2:15:41| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| I am actually going to speak really quickly to agenda items 12C, D, and E as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8143)|
| 2:15:50| I'm going to be making a motion to send them back to MPC with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| I have been in discussion with the applicant as well as the neighboring residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8156)|
| 2:16:04| If Council remembers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| you've got a great deal of correspondence from airing neighbors there about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| This was also a split vote at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| It went 9-4, and there was a bid at 9-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| There are more people than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| Anyway, I have basically spent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| I want to recognize the folks that are here for this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| Marty Norton is the applicant as well as Christy and Tim Nutter are some of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| that live immediate to this property, and we've spent a great deal of time together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| and I appreciate you guys sitting here for over two hours to get to your agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8199)|
| 2:16:44| for this process to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| But I would like to thank them for the many discussions that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| This was a very difficult zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| That area is annexed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| Some of it was industrial when it was annexed quite some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8215)|
| 2:17:00| Anyway, the request from Mr. Norton, he just wants to use some land that he purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| that's next to industrial, and then the Nortons there have, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8224)|
| 2:17:10| Ms. Nutter has been there for well over 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| and some of the families there have been there for over 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| So we have some residential area there that is kind of surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| by what appears on a zoning map to be very industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| which was persuasive to many of the MPC commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| because the land next to the railroad tracks is just auto by default industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| It's ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| We have whole farms out there, county parks that are ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| but they're zoned industrial, hillsides that are zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| And so it makes a really difficult situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| and I think the reason that it was a difficult vote at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| is because there were commissioners that asked MPC for an analysis of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| and what was the best use of that land as the city grows and progresses that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| So anyway, Mr. Norton has agreed to keep the back part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8282)|
| 2:18:09| that he doesn't intend to use for his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| It's an amended application going back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| which I've discussed with Amy Brooks as well as Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| to keep the back half or the back portion a residential lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| that would give them buffer to the industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| He bought something that was existing industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| I just could not put industrial next to their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| and in front of the home that faces that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| So this was a compromise that would enable him to use the front part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| So my motion, which will apply to all three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| and I guess I have to make it three times, is I can make one motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8327)|
| 2:18:53| The lawyer says you can make it with one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| If counsel agrees, it's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| If anybody doesn't like that, you let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| So I'm going to make a motion to send this back to MPC for a review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| for an amended application, as agreed to with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| to keep a residential lot, 50 by 150 and some change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8349)|
| 2:19:16| at the back portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| and allowing the industrial use at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| And I would also tack onto that, Ms. Brooks, my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| that I would ask MPC to consider –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| I know this is asking for a zoning study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| so maybe that's a separate thing –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| but to consider that there's a mix of county and city land out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| that's not accurately represented for what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| and what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| It's not going to be factories, I don't believe, and industrial smelting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| Ms. Rider, before we – we can discuss a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| I just – to clarify the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| you're making a motion for items 12C, D, and E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| to refer them back to MPC per the description you just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| The abbreviated version would be for an amended application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| to include a residential lot at the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| Okay. Is there a second to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8409)|
| 2:20:10| Okay, the motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| Did you have any further comments, Ms. Rider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| or any questions from other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Just a quick comment that I appreciate the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| that you've put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| and helping those involved reach a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| because I knew this was going to be a difficult issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| and I hated the idea of too much expansion of industrial in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8432)|
| 2:20:37| And I'm glad the residents will have a buffer between them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8437)|
| 2:20:42| and that industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| So I just wanted to applaud you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| and thank you for all the work that you did on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| I will give that to Mr. Norton and the Nutters for working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| I feel y'all's pain after doing 2D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| I'll come back in 2 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| So the motion was made to refer back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| It was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8471)|
| 2:21:20| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| We have two people signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| The first person is Mr. Michael Honeycutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| Mr. Honeycutt, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| Mr. Honeycutt, Michael Honeycutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| Going once, going twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| I think Mr. Honeycutt's no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| So we'll go to the second person, David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| Mr. Hayes, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| And you have up to five minutes to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8504)|
| 2:21:50| David Hayes, 241 Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| It's been a while, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| First off, I just want to say sort of a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| that it's important to prioritize the needs and wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| of the residents, neighborhoods, and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| And while developers should be included in some conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| it's the people that must be prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| So I hope that every single one of y'all will support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| the Old Sevier neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| So I also want to start off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| I don't have any grudges from the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Honestly, I just have more motivation to continue running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| and continue making sure that we have good folks on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| But I did want to clear up some misconceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| from Councilman Roberto's recent blog post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| that outlines what happened as far as last Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| with the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| And I know that's not representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| of how everybody thinks, but this was a public post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| so I wanted to respond publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| So, Councilman Roberto, at the beginning of your post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| you mentioned that you have preferred to let people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| in District 1 select their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| through a traditional election rather than a council appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| That's something I definitely agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| in that you believe in a democratic process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| and continue to engage in community-wide participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| in the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| Those are things I agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| but I think folks in the community would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| if you believed in elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| there would have been expectations that you would have supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| the candidates that the community actually elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| just a few months prior to this appointment process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| You go on to say that you felt the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| to identify and evaluate some qualities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| the best qualities for candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| was to attend many South Knoxville neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| and mentioning that you only saw Tommy Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| and Janice Tolcher attending those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| So one thing that's important to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| is that not all residents go or are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| in neighborhood association meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| It's important to actually directly talk to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| in public housing, working-class neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| make direct contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| Neighborhood representatives aren't representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| of all of our neighborhoods and communities, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| But with that, they are important institutions within a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| and should be empowered and should be enlarged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| so I do support them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| And I spent a whole year going to neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| all across the city, but especially District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| I didn't just win District 1 in voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| because I'm from District 1 and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| I won it because of the work I put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| and the relationships I built in neighborhood association meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| but also in communities all throughout the city, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| And as you all know, campaigning is tiring work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| I think I was one of the first ones to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| So when you go 12 months straight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| you don't necessarily have the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| at the beginning of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| So although throughout the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| leading up to the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| I was knocking on doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| I wasn't working-class neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| I was going to some neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| I was kind of pooped out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| I think everybody can understand that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| You go on to say that you repeatedly heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8680)|
| 2:24:45| neighbors and community members say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| that's important to be accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| and to do that, you must show up to community events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| and engage with those you serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| Again, I spent a year going to community events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| and neighborhood association meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| and door-knocking and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| as you all are all aware, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| And I was actually the only candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| to describe a plan to be accessible, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| It's one thing to say you want to be accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| but it's another thing to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| this is how I'm going to be accessible, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| Y'all remember me talking about the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| between the community and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| Councilwoman and Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| Councilwoman Gwen McKenzie mentioned that before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| with the struggle going on at Park Ridge, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| I'm the only one who actually talked about that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| and actually talked about a strategy to overcome that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| through acknowledging the lack of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| and communication that is systemic throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| and the lack of community engagement and processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| and a lack of trust that communities have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| that the voices will be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| and reflected in the outcomes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| And actually, in meeting with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| you actually detail plans and actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| that we can take to resolve those, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| So when we talk about a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| and people actually wanting to be accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| we got to talk about how that actually happens as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| And also, one thing you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| that most citizens you spoke with in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| expressed support for Tommy Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| and also received numerous emails and letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| expressing their support for a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| And that you received the most messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| on behalf of Janice Tolcher and Tommy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| And this is just another misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| Some would say lie, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| Because we, as you all saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| had 730 petition signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Over 200 of those individuals are from District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| Both those numbers is bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| than everybody else in the competition, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| I had 162 comments, extended comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| that we sent to you all separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| And those comments equate to the email and the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| We just gave you all in a bat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| instead of just having them filter in, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| Also, there's ignoring that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| the most supporters in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| and ignoring that I won, again, one District 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| because of the work and the relationship I've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| So I say to all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| say that you have the right to vote for whoever you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8802)|
| 2:26:44| as the power is given to you in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| regardless of the sentiment in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| But when explaining your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| about why you came to that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| let's refrain from spreading miscommunication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| and misconceptions about the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| and the community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| Thank you, Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200225?start=8823)|
