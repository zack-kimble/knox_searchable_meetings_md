| 0:15:17| And we got approved last December through the bank and closed our loan in early spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=917)|
| 0:15:26| And we've started to build out in late March and about 90, probably about 80 percent of the build out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=926)|

| 0:17:08| So Sergeant Howard. No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| Mr. Byrd. Likewise, the building inspections, fire prevention and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1033)|

| 0:17:26| Yes. Brad West or 801 Hilldale Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| Knoxville, Tennessee. 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| So this is for the manufacturing. Just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| Make a motion to approve pending final documentation. Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1060)|
| 0:17:49| And I've got a second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| Hearing none. Mr. Johnson, roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| Councilman Ryder. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Councilman Singh. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Councilman Smith. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Councilman Testimon. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Councilman Thomas. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| Councilman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| Councilman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| Councilman Fugate is no longer on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| Vice Mayor McKenzie. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| Councilman Parker. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| That was eight in favor and one away from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| OK. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| Our next series of items will be items for M through for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| These are all items from the university of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| I believe Jeff Maples is on the phone or on the call to talk to us about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| What I would suggest we do is have them do their presentation, which will be the same for each of those individual items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1144)|
| 0:19:15| We can certainly ask questions at that time if we'd like, but then move individually to each individual item and pass those as you as we've done in the earlier parts of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1155)|
| 0:19:30| So that would be my suggestion. So either Mike McDonald or Jeff Maples, are you there for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| I'm here, but I will. This is Jeff Maples. I will refer to McDonald, who is actually with their mark. Who's who submitted the permit request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1178)|
| 0:19:49| I'll be available to answer any questions related to you. T perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Specific. All right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Would you like to give us your name and address, Mr. McDonald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Yes. My name is Michael McDonald. I live at 1713 Bear Run Drive in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15237.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1201)|
| 0:20:10| I'm the district manager responsible for the athletic facilities at the University of Tennessee for Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| You want to tell us about what we're looking at here in each of these items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Yes. Yes. And thank you for entertaining me today. We're here for three individual items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| There are two applications for permits. One would be for the Goodfriend Parkdale Tennis Center, which is a new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| That's before you, as is the Allen Jones Aquatic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| So both of those are new applications before the board today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| We're also here to ask that you amend our alcohol service policy or serve your right program to allow for the service of of alcoholic beverages in the manufacturer's original containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1247)|
| 0:21:03| The reason behind that is we're looking to react to some of the pandemic issues that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| It's a package that comes to us sealed from the manufacturers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| It would go directly into the hands of the consumer or they would pick it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| They would then be in a sealed container, which we would crack and they would move on with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| It limits the exposure of pouring those products into a cup and having the additional open air dwell time of having that product out in a line where there's people waiting for beer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1288)|
| 0:21:45| It will also improve the service time, which will further reduce the line to time in line and aid in the social distancing of moving through those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1305)|
| 0:21:58| The packaging is obviously there is a lot of money invested in the branding of those packaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| So we feel that it is still easily identifiable by the more than almost 2,000 employees that are on site at the stadium looking for underage individuals and create additionally some less garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1323)|
| 0:22:20| So we think for those purposes, it does aid in our service applications at the larger facilities for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1340)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| The service change that you're talking about, was that for a limited period of time or can you talk to us a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| The original application was filed with the fact that the SEC had mandated originally that it had to be poured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| The SEC recently changed that ruling, realizing that in the times we live in, this is a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| There was no real reason to stay with the for all requirement anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| So when they changed their policies, we elected to come back to the board and ask that we're able to permanently change our service application so that we can hand it in the manufacturer's container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1382)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| I'll open it up for other questions if anyone else has any other questions they'd like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1400)|
| 0:23:33| Oh, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Actually, to put a finer point on what Mr. McDonald said, the SEC approved for a one year period the crack and give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1416)|
| 0:23:47| So it's not a permanent change that's been approved by the SEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| So it's not a it's not a permanent change that they're applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| It's it's the change what's currently on the table or excuse me, what they currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| And they might, depending on what the SEC does next year, they might need to come back next year again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| Mr. Frost, this Jeff Michaels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| You're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| What we would ask, though, is that it would give us the ability at non athletic and we continue to serve in a container in the original containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1451)|
| 0:24:21| McDonald mentioned that the SEC decides to repeal the one year hiatus, then we would go back to comply with the SEC regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1461)|
| 0:24:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| You're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So the question before us is for a one year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Well, I would suggest that it would also be for non NCAA events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| It's common practice throughout the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| If the SEC chose to instate the rule, then obviously we would abide by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| But we would apply to serve it in the in the vessel from the manufacturer when otherwise available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1495)|
| 0:25:05| Yeah, I understand what Mr. McDonald is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| And I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| But what UT has been authorized by the SEC is for a one year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| So the SEC has set a condition on the permit and all that Aramark can apply for is what the SEC will give them at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1518)|
| 0:25:34| Mr. Frost, this is Will T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| It looks like we have a question from Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Go ahead, Mr. Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1543)|
| 0:25:58| Mr. Chiefs represented Aramark in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Am I on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Mr. Frost, may I say I agree with you on the SEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| What we were looking to do was be able to get an approval for SEC games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| That's limited to the one year on on non SEC events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| For example, some sort of show or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| And I show at Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| That's not an SEC event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| And if we could go ahead and get approval for those after the one year, that would be desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Honestly, if that's been asked before, I'll admit I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| But honestly, I don't remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I think it's going to be something to that will follow up on in the next week after I confer with Miss Dyer in the law department and look at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1613)|
| 0:27:05| So, Mr. Frost, it is what's before us today is actually for that one year period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| We've been asked to maybe consider something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| But what we're actually dealing with today is the one year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| The one year for the crack and go, as it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| It's played out on page 213 of the beer board agenda packet about halfway down the third from the bottom bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1642)|
| 0:27:35| I just wanted to make sure we were clear what we were voting on for the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| So what you're looking at here is a one year period for this this program for each of these individual facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1660)|
| 0:27:49| Well, I hear what Mr. Cheek was saying and look for and get back with him in a week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1669)|
| 0:28:01| Mr. Frost, may I ask, could it be possible that we the approval for that would be contingent to the one year approval for the SEC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1681)|
| 0:28:12| But if the SEC agrees to extend this indefinitely, then are we could we could comply with that extension of that service, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1692)|
| 0:28:29| I know what you're I know what you're trying to do, and I don't disagree with asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| And if you don't ask, you'll never find out what it actually says for approved for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1715)|
| 0:28:46| So I'm afraid that's all we're able to consider tonight. Respectfully, Mr. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| I understand. Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| All right. So just so we're clear, we're voting on the one year for each of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| Councilperson Smith, you had a question. Mr. Maples addressed my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| OK. Any other discussion about Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you. I'm going to come way out from left field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| And I just wanted to ask about Aramak and the accusations of bad business practice, labor, labor practice and all the fines that they have had to pay to other government entities and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1760)|
| 0:29:37| Yeah, I want to ask about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| I have no record. I have no knowledge of what you're talking. I'm sure we're involved in litigation from time to time, but we enjoy a very, very good relationship with the union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1781)|
| 0:29:57| Many of these across the country. I'm not I personally am not aware of any thing at pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| And I'm not quite sure what it has to do with today's agenda, but if there was something I needed to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| Well, what it has to do with today's agenda is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| I'm thinking about what's good for Knoxville if there's so much so much litigation and there's been more than a million dollars in fine paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| And with the bad labor practices, I don't know if this would serve Knoxville. I know that you're not here for the permit. Most of that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| And this is a very small change. But still, these things are important to me. So I'll be voting no on the next few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1835)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Councilperson Puget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Thank you. Just to be clear, though, the contract, the University of Tennessee decides who they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1853)|
| 0:31:03| They they they awarded the contract. Correct. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| OK, so it's up to the University of Tennessee to do due diligence about who they want to provide service for them. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1868)|
| 0:31:19| That is also correct. OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| And I'll ask Mr. Frost if he could maybe comment on some of these matters for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you, Chairman Roberto. Councilmember Singh, I certainly know your heart is in the right place and that issue is important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1891)|
| 0:31:42| However, respectfully, that is not one of the criteria that you should take into account in voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| This is an administrative decision. And if Aramark checks all the boxes, so to speak, the law provides that they shall get their permit not to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1909)|
| 0:32:09| He froze. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| He froze up, Mr. Frost, for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| No pun intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| His video and audio are off. He's muted. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| OK, I think I understood what what the point he was making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Miss. I understand all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| It's just a matter that I wanted to bring up. And, you know, my heart, it's checking all the boxes is what gets us into a lot of situations that we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1962)|
| 0:32:53| So I realize the parameters of what the decision making is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| But this is where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Thank you. This is Jeff Maples again with the University of Tennessee. And I understand Councilmember Singh's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| And I've heard the same issues brought up to us by students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| But many of the accusations, so to speak, have found it not to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| There are Internet rumors, things of that nature. Some are true. Some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| I would be more than glad here in the next few weeks when it becomes hopefully more we're able to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| I'll be glad to sit down with you and go over some of your concerns with you if you would like me to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| I'll be more than welcome and listen to each one you have. And if those are founded, we'll have conversations as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| But again, I think you'll find that some of the accusations you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| Some, like I said, are accurate. Some are just Internet rumors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| And as a matter of fact, I can send you an article that I was recently sent that concerning some of the things I believe you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2035)|
| 0:34:05| And I'll be glad to answer those. But again, I respect your desires to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| And I understand completely. Thank you, Mr. Naples. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| Any further conversation about these? Basically, the presentation will be the same for each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| So we're just going to go through the presentation once. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| All right. Not seeing any further discussion. Mr. Johnson, go ahead and call the first item, which is for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2071)|
| 0:34:40| Yes, we need a motion and a report. Well, a report from Mr. Bird and Mr. Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| All right. So this is an Allen Jones Aquatic Center, right? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Correct. OK. Sergeant Coward. No record. Mr. Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| We need a current business license and building inspection and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| And can you go ahead and state your name and address for us? Mr. McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Michael McDonald. 1713 Bear Run Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 15237.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2113)|
| 0:35:24| Any motions? Move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2124)|

| 0:48:49| It would be over a year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| And in the past, we've required people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| who have been longer than six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2938)|

| 0:49:12| I'm sorry, did you say that's not a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2952)|

| 0:49:42| these matters in the past, if we've encountered these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| I'm not sure who's the right one to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| Is that Mr. Byrd, or Mr. Coward, or Sergeant Coward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| or Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=2993)|

| 0:50:00| This is Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| We haven't encountered one recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| I don't think under my tenure, the instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| that I were left, it's been, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| the generally accepted veer board rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| that any background check older than six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| would require a background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| as there was the possibility of someone gaining a charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| or something that might prevent them from otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| obtaining a veer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Is there anyone that could maybe speak to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| that this has now been pending for over a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| I don't know that we've encountered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| this example in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| That's why I'm trying to ask to get a baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Over a year, I will say, is thankfully a rare occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3063)|
| 0:51:11| It doesn't happen much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| I feel sorry for the applicant with the coronavirus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| situation in the past six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| But Sergeant Coward is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| And considering the applicant is willing to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I think you all might consider extending it 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| upon the gentleman going through another background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| check in 30 days, 45 days, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| And then it comes back in a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| where he is able to hold a veer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| That means there's been no disqualifying event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3118)|
| 0:52:08| Chair Roberto, if I may, sir, could you maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| refresh our memory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Because it looks like we first gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| the approval on July 16, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| We approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| And then in October 22, 2019, we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| gave you an additional postponement to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| So could you refresh our memory on what those things were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| and why you weren't able to accomplish those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| We understand COVID coming into play around the end of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| and March of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| But could you maybe refresh our memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| on why you required the postponements in 2019, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3165)|
| 0:53:04| Is the gentleman, is he still with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| He is still on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Looks like it might have been a pending due to the inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| the building, fire prevention, and health department approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3199)|
| 0:53:28| Mr. Johnson, is he muted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| He is not muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| Well, let me go back to what Mr. Frost was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| Mr. Frost, were you suggesting that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| could ask for a new background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| and have a report back on that within the next either 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| And go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| The gentleman volunteered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| If you all take no action tonight to extend the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| period, his permit will, in essence, fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| And he will have to begin again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| There have been, on occasion, instead of continuing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| it does not get extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| And they restart the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Or like this gentleman said, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| would undergo the background check at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| So again, I would like to hear from the applicant why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| they were not able to achieve the approvals for inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| prior to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| I understand, definitely understand COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| But I just need to understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| they were not able to achieve those inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| approvals in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| He's no longer on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| He's off the call now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3302)|
| 0:55:16| Well, I think we have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| We can take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| And they'll have to start over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Or we could, you know, there was an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| to go ahead and do another background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| And we could give an extension for another 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| to see if that was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| I would make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I'm going to assume that he had some technical difficulties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| as I know that can happen quite often with Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| and dialing in remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| So I'll make a motion to extend for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| and come back to the table to get some maybe explanations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| and further conversation around what happened in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Again, I'm very sensitive to anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| that's affected by coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| But again, we saw multiple extensions in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| So I'd really like to understand what prevented them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| from being able to move forward then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| So that's my motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| I don't want to prove anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| I just want to pin for 30 days, if that's permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| It's actually a motion to extend for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| So we've got a motion to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| That's the motion I'd like to put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| So we've got a motion to extend for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| And I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| If I could point out, a 30-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| would push it beyond your next meeting in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| just for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| 30 days would be August 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| So maybe the motion should be to extend to the August meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| If that's what the board wishes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| What would be our last meeting date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| What's the meeting date in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| I would like to put forth a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| to postpone until the August 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| Extend to August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Yes, extend to August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| I heard a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200728?start=3460)|
