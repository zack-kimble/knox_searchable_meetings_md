| 0:03:34| Please take note when the item is announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=214)|

| 0:03:42| Following any staff comments, I will ask if the applicant is present and if there is any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=222)|

| 0:09:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| At Tuesday's agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| I stated that I had heard that Art Clancy, Lou Browning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| and Chris Eaton had all been reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| No action has been taken on their reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Their reappointment is not assured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I apologize for that and for providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| incorrect information to the commission and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| And for getting our hopes up that Art definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| would be joining us for another term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Again, that decision has not been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| and we're waiting for it regarding the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| appointments from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| One other thing to say, although her name is on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Ms. Korbelick asked not to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| and let her term on the commission start next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| She did not feel she was prepared for this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| having just been confirmed last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| She didn't feel she can make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| in the best interest of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=612)|

| 0:22:47| There is no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Mr. Mullins, would you like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| I would be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| There was an email, to be fair to the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| there was an email in opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| that was posted to the case file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| And I can address that more specifically if needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| but I don't really believe I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| I mean, this particular matter may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| be familiar to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| It has been in front of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| a couple of different ways before when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| I was previously for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| seeking to have this rezoned to a planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| That was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Ultimately, county commission decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| to revise the text of the neighborhood commercial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| to allow a automobile repair shop with up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| bays to be used as a use on review for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| The sector plan for this particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| has always been neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| during this period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| With the amendment, I withdrew my application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| to rezone it to planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| and am seeking the neighborhood commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| which is consistent with the current sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| So I would ask that the commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1452)|

| 0:25:28| Next is a rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| The applicant is Primos Land Company, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| The location is the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Before I forget, I had my hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Before I forget, when the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| considered the postponements on the 1360 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| I thought there should have been a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| and that was confirmed by another staff member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| There was no vote on the 1360-day postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| So before we finish the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| we'll have to go back and have a vote on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Sorry, I didn't catch it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| I just thought maybe something had changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| But we do need a vote on the 1360-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| OK, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| It looked like everything was automatic postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| I didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| No, just that first list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| We didn't have any 30 or 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| Jess, do you want to read the item number for the Primos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| Do I want to read the item number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Let me get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| The Primos is agenda item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| So going back to this, the applicant, Primos Land Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1598)|
| 0:26:48| LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| The location is the north side of West Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| west side of Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| The approximate size of tract is 22.29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| The zoning requested is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Staff recommend to approve PR, planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| The applicant requested PR up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| I am, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| And opposition, just raise your hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| and I will call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Ms. Greenwood and Mr. Starkweather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| Mr. Sanderson, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| I'll let the opposition respond first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| OK, Ms. Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1675)|
| 0:27:55| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1678)|
| 0:27:58| I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Is it just me and one other speaker that I've asked to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| It looks like, yes, you and Mr. Starkweather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| OK, I'll be brief and let him take the rest of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Do we get five minutes together then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Yes, together, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I attended the meeting on Tuesday, the agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| meeting, and I've submitted comments as well by email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| So if you haven't seen those, I would refer you to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| And I won't go over those today in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| But I do have some concerns that I put in the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| mostly about the process here of approving this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| But the main thing I wanted to point out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| is that when on Tuesday this was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| it was mentioned that the surrounding zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| allows in the area up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| And I know that the staff has recommended four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| However, if you look at what's adjacent to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| on the east side, you've got a big subdivision that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| one to three acres dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| that were approved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Then on the west side, you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I guess what Ms. Albertson had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| was it's about two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| If you go up to the north also, it's, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| maybe a quarter mile north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| There's another housing development up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| that was a Smith boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| It was originally going to be condos, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| and then it turned into, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| separate dwellings, individual homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| But that was also zoned, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| So if you take it all into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| really three is the highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| It's in that surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| And then, of course, you've got agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| immediately to the north, which allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| what, I guess like one per acre or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| But it's significantly very low development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| very low density in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| And part of that is the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| It's a very lumpy kind of an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| and also it's very rustic back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Blacks Ferry is a 17-foot wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| I think Carpenter isn't much wider on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| And of course, this area, this part of Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| is very dangerous and has a high crash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| has high crash statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| according to what I heard on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| So you've got this very, you know, windy roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| very no shoulders, very rustic kind of an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| And you're talking about making it like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| some of the areas that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| if you leapfrog some of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| you might get to five units or four units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| but really this area shouldn't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| and this particular property shouldn't be more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| The hillside analysis also said 3.75, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| So to go to four, the only reasoning given to go to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| was because there's a lot of demand for housing in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| It's been that way for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| It'll be that way for a while until it all gets built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| but you can't just arbitrarily, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| say, well, there's a lot of demand for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| so we're gonna go with four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| If you made decisions that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| you could make everything five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| and your job would be a lot easier, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| and just go with five and the developers be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| But that's not reasonable from a planning perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| I think if you wanna build on this property right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| in the way things are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| you need to have it fit with the surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| That's what zoning's all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| is not to have incompatible zoning in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| in the middle of all the rest of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| The roads are not adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| The other density is low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| So I just wanted to point that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| especially that property up above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| is up to three units per acre, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and that was with the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| that Blacksberry Road would be improved down to Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| which never happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| but that was part of the assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| So that's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| I could say a lot more about long-term concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| and some of the other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I know, echoed that on Tuesday in a more general way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| about all the property that's happening in Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| is getting developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| and the character of the land is getting taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| A lot of the beauty of Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| is getting lost in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| and very little amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| We're just getting cookie-cutter houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| all the same type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| that may go out of favor in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| especially once they start getting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| So there's a lot to be discussed in a broader way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| maybe at a different forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| but those are my specific concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you, Ms. Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Mr. Starkweather, would you like to give your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Sure, my name is Byron Starkweather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| and my wife and I reside at 7424 Northampton Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| and so our home is adjacent to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| that's being considered for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| We're in opposition to the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| for many of the reasons that Ms. Greenwood said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| so I'm not going to belabor those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Traffic in our area is already an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| and putting such a high density of homes in the small area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| is only going to exacerbate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| One of the primary concerns we have is in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| there is a community pool that is at the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| of Patriot Way and Northampton Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| and one of the options for accessing this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| is Patriot Way, and the county recommended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| in the file that they posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Because of the pool and its proximity to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| even though the pool has a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| the greenway nearby does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| There's no parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| and so the families who use this pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| park alongside the road, many with small children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and I realize that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| can't give a definitive answer now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| about whether they will use Patriot Way or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| but changing the rezoning will allow that option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| and with the small children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| there's a tremendous safety hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| in regarding the number of trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| that will be made into and out of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| With the kids, my own children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| we use these streets for exercise, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| So our concerns have to do primarily with the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| but also with the safety in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Yes, Madam Chair, thank you again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| and I know your job isn't easy when it comes to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| You all have, I know there's a lot of opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| a lot of concerned citizens out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| when it comes to these farms that we have rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| especially in the Carnes and Powell Halls communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| This particular farm, I know, has its own concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| I know Blacks Ferry Road has been a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| which we have no anticipation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| not only the slope, but just the road size in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| We have no intentions of accessing Blacks Ferry Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| and we have a rough concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| It has one entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| It comes in off West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| We have not tied it into Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| We won't know what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| nor will the county know what they need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| until we do get a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| which is the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| So today we're asking for the zoning of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| and accepting the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| of four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| which falls in line with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| So I've asked this commission to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| at four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| allow us to get a concept plan together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| and talk to these concerned citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| with actual knowledge and calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| that these engineers, these qualified engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| calculate the owners and pay the residents in Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| At four units an acre, we want to reach out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| and want to reach out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| about how we can either deter people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| from using Patriot's Way if we have to tie into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| or maybe even improving their amenities over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| maybe by installing a sidewalk or additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| But at four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| us, the community, and the developer can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| along with TDOT and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| to make sure it's much of a win-win situation for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| And again, I appreciate, and I can ask any question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| or answer any questions that you'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| And I really appreciate the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| that you will be reaching out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Kerns is a really strong community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| and they've got active involvement by the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| and really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| that you're going to be reaching out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| So we're going to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| I don't see any hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Anybody have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| Yes, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| that we approve PR plan residential up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| to four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| Okay, a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Commissioner Phillips, you also have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Well, I second the motion, but I'll lower it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Okay, I didn't know whether you had anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| more to say on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| I do not see any other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| So we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| to approve four going units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Mr. Wise, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Mr. Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2253)|
| 0:37:33| Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Mr. Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Mr. Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2258)|

| 0:43:51| or how the property may be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| which that leads to some challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| in evaluating this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| because it is such a large single parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| As part of our zoning application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| and because we were in the growth policy plan area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| we did do a traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| at the request of the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And that was at an assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| that it would be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| at the requested three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| with multiple access points to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| That is part of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| There was one email in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| which raised many of the same issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| that you would hear in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| concerns about traffic and density and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Interestingly, there was also another email in support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| and I promise you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| I do not know who this individual is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| I didn't ask him to send this email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| But he laid out a very compelling argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| at least from our perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| as to why the three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| is consistent with other development areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| outside of the growth policy, the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| We are still asking for three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| We understand the hillside protection slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| when you factored everything into this, came to 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| I would remind the commission that in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| the county has specifically made a policy decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| that says the slope analysis is not binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| but advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| And you look, and Liz, thank you for bringing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| the map, the topo map up on the screen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| the colored one, scroll back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| You can see in the area that is to the east of Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| the same area that's in the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| and the technology overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| there is a significant amount of slope there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| that in a total analysis, when you look at all 250 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| is really, I think, bringing down the numbers to that 2.51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| When you look at the main portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| there is significantly less slope there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| And although I lack the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| to run the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| taking that technology overlay portion out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| I believe that would be significantly closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| to the three dwelling units an acre that we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Again, you can see the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| immediately to the south of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| and that is the property that has already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| for planned residential one to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| We don't think that the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| will ultimately be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| at the three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| They rarely are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| But at this point, without having the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| and to put in the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| to do a full traffic analysis, level two or level three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| depending on how many trips are anticipated to be generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| we would like the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| to have up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| And then ultimately on the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| these other issues will be worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| through county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| once there is someone willing to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| The roads out there, you look on the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| they identify 18.8 feet of pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| and a right of way of 60 feet on Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| Access on Swofford indicates there's pavement width of 18.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| and a right of way of 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| That varies as you drive around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| The most direct way to access the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| off of Hardin Valley is to go up Solway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| and on to Gwinn Road and then on to Swofford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| That is the most direct path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| The intersection between Gwinn and Swofford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| there is an embankment there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| that could affect site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| as one was turning left and going southwest on Gwinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| However, that would be taking away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| from the property development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| away from Hardin Valley and Pellissippi area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| That can be improved once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| once we get into engineering and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Since the hillside protection is advisory only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| since it's consistent with property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| that's already been rezoned to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Mr. Millins, you have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you very much, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Since the density that we're asking is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| with what's already been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| and zoned out there to the south and the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| and since we don't have enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| really to know what this ultimately will be developed at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| but probably less, like the surrounding developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| less than the three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| we'd ask that you approve the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| per our request at three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| and help Ms. Rowland market and sell her property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| to a quality developer that can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| through these issues at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Ms. Albertson, do you have anything to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| that you'd like commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| in our consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| You know, nothing particularly in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| I think Mr. Mullins has described most of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| and sort of their response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| As he noted, they did submit a traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| as part of this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| and our staff had an opportunity to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| as did Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| You know, there was recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| for a couple of different access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Again, staff is, you know, looking at many factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| and what we make our recommendations on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| So it's not just the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| it's also the surrounding zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| the existing land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| the fact that, you know, a big portion of this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| is in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| So that's, you know, where we came down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| to our recommendation of 2.5 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| And I think that's pretty much it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| unless any of the other staff wants to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| So we're gonna go in the order of the hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| that I saw raised, Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3036)|
| 0:50:47| Yes, Madam Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Like to make a motion that we adopt resolution 5A20SP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| that are rural residential because it's adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| to the planned growth area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| We do still have some hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| So Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| what's the next act that I saw raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| No, I'm fine with the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| meaning the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| I do believe that the staff has it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| on the density at 2.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| But that's all I want to comment on at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Okay, Commissioner Asan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| I would like to agree also with the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| on the 2.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| I think this is a unique piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| and it has some really wonderful potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| It's a large parcel, 250 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| but that's not what makes it unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| I think what really makes it unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| is that almost the majority of this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| is pretty much a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| It also has the hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| which I know is just advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| but it's an important thing for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| And it also has some farm land on the soils map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| when you look at that on the KGIS mapping system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| So I think it makes it really unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| and I think the staff is correct at 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| We do have a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| I don't see any other hands other than Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| did you have something else to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| or are you waiting to make the second motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| No, I'm gonna make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| But I did wanna say that I agree with Commissioner Eason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| somewhat on the 2.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| but I'd heard something in an agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| pre-agenda that they were gonna propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| some type of a green development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| I think it's a perfect opportunity to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| And Elizabeth, I think maybe a little more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| might give them the opportunity to do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| with that considering they've got slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| I didn't wanna interject that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| but I'll let somebody else talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Yeah, I just wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| I was thinking the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| that Commissioner Clancy was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| with a track like this, I would encourage more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| You can get so creative in what you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| and utilizing this property and creating open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| But I don't think in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| you can know that in any way wanna short the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| give them some room to have a creative concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| Mr. Green, I'm gonna slide you in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| before Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| The staff recommendation is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| given the fact that we don't know what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I think both Commissioners Clancy and Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| had made real good comments about creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| for the reasons that Commissioner Eason stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| the uniqueness of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| We have a tool that allows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| through the plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| The owner or the subsequent developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| could bring in a plan that had 10 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| And if it were created and met the desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| of the planning commission, that plan could be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| So we'd set a base here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| not knowing what may happen with the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| but there is an approach that allows that creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| and that significantly higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| if the plan meets the desires of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| So I think we've covered both bases here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| We see the challenge of branding density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| and not knowing what the plan will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| that we come in with issues that sometimes have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| or plans that sometimes have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| But through the plan development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| I think we do have that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| for greater density and creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And we've set a good base here, 2.5 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| not knowing what may happen with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| Well, good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| Commissioner Eason, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Director Graham just answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| and just mentioned some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| that I was thinking about, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| Okay, Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| Yes, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| that we approve PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| of the three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| So we haven't voted on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Sorry, right, we haven't voted on the first yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| No, that's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| Okay, so stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3352)|
| 0:55:52| We do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| to adopt the resolution amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| the Northwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Mr. Wise, call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3364)|

| 0:56:06| Mr. Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3368)|
| 0:56:08| Mr. Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Mr. Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3372)|
| 0:56:12| Mr. Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3374)|

| 0:56:18| Mr. Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Mr. Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3384)|
| 0:56:24| Mr. Talker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Now, Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| I'd like to make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| plan residential of the three diluted units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| because it's consistent with slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| I'd like to second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| a second by Commissioner Roth to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| planned residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| I'd like to point out that Commissioner Clancy said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| because it is consistent with the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| in part of his motion, and that's not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| I concede and change my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| to just three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| Commissioner Roth, are you good with that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3434)|
| 0:57:14| I'll revise in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Mr. Wise, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Mr. Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3441)|

| 0:57:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Mr. Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3450)|

| 1:04:03| Yeah, yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| I guess the question for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| I'm okay with what they're proposing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| but in the event that the project does not proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| you know, we've got a 17 acre tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| with 10 million years per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Could this not be another planned unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| planned development under the County Ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| The, it's merely, I'll go Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| The question is whether it would rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| to the level of creativity and that we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| a planned development to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| I think the zoning approach and allowing the senior living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| as proposed by Mr. Anderson and Mr. Farrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| in that zoning district is probably a more efficient way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| and more direct way and does not push,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| trying to squeeze this into the planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| approval process may be a bit of an overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| But Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| what you're aiming towards, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| is if the unit doesn't go in as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| then you're not in favor of apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| or that sort of thing going in, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| Well, I think if the applicant is indicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| what they're proposing to do and the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| doesn't understand that once it's rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| any residential use could go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| whether it be apartments or condos or cluster homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| or townhomes or any number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| That's my only concern is, in the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| the project does not proceed as what we're hearing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| then we could end up with a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| that I think a lot of residents would not accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| But that's what we do on almost every rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| I mean, I'll go ahead and make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| to adopt resolution 5B20SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| because the MDR medium residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| sector plan designation provides a transitional land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| from the more intense technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| and business park classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| and the adjacent low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| per attached resolution exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| Did anybody second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Mr. Grafton, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| a second by Commissioner Graft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| We still have some hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| I'm in favor of doing this, of this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| but no matter what the development becomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| it still has to come back to us, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| That was my comment also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| is that I think the second part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| the next, the plan residential gives us the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| to make, if it does change hands and changes concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| that we have some review opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| I don't see any other hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| a second by Commissioner Graft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| to adopt this resolution per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| And since this is a sector county plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| there was an indication of why we are making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| So I think that we're ready for roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Commissioner Smith, do you have your hand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| Sorry, yeah, I just had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| about the sector plan change to New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Is there any greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I mean, I know Hardin Valley is changing and growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| but is there any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| is that an automatic approval for a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| if you go from LDR to MDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| Is there any greater bar that has to be met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I'm just, I'm really surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| that there's not a bunch of neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| that are going crazy over 10 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| but I don't know, maybe these guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| have just done a really good job in communicating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| but is there any higher standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| that must be met for MDR or for medium density over LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| No, it's still the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| for a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| those change in development pattern, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| a mistake in the original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| the standards for a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| remain the same regardless of the type of change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| And I think it is interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4179)|
| 1:09:39| that we have not heard from the Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| residents regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| I think some of it's due to the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| and it's transitioned from a business park area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| to residential along Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| with the mixture of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Yeah, I just, I mean, are we gonna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| once we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| are we gonna have a property near here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| come in and use this as justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| for something similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| We may, and we'll have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| we'll wait and see and see what this leads to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Every decision we make seems to set a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| for something, good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| Okay, I don't see any other hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| Ms. Wise, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4232)|

| 1:11:01| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| Yes, Madam Chair, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| to approve PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| up to 10 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4270)|

| 1:18:14| or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Okay, you folks have five minutes in total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| unless the commissioners would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| to approve additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| And let's see, I've got one hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I think we should allow more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| since there was considerable opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| to this development for the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| so they have a reasonable amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| to make their case, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| What do you think is reasonable, three minutes each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Okay, so Mr. Murphy, you're at the top of the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| so I'm gonna let you go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| Remember, those in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| because you each have three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| you don't have to use all three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| and just make sure that what you're presenting is unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| and don't repeat what others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| have already presented to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| But Mr. Murphy, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| This is Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| I do have video and content to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| if that can be enabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| While somebody's checking on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| I wanna thank everybody for a really great discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| that you had at the agenda review meeting on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| And it looks like there's also about 38 pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| of public comment that have been submitted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| I'd like to request that you consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| postponing these items until at least a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| It'll give the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Mr. Murphy, we lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| He's rejoining as a panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| That way you can share your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4814)|
| 1:20:14| Let me grab that screen, share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| So I think one thing that has also happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| is there's a application in for 7605 Twin Oak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| That's in, you can see in green on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| that's a property that Thompson Meadows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| but there's another property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| that now has a concept plan under review right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| And that's next to Gibbs Middle and Gibbs Elementary Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| And that actually gives a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| potentially if it was designed right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| it could give us a pedestrian connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| which would possibly impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| the partner responsibility zone area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| So I think postponement would actually allow you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| to consider really the totality of a couple of developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| that are now being looked at in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| And that gets down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| the community would really like it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I've spoken with a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| they'd like this to be an asset to the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| The housing that's there to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| is really the standard subdivision with cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| no sidewalks, no amenities, no parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| You have to get in your car and drive everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| And the community is looking to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| and they've got some vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| and they'd really like some help implementing that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| And so this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| the concept plan that's been presented to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| doesn't really, it doesn't implement that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| It doesn't implement what the planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| or planned residential zoning ordinance calls for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| which is someplace that is a unified character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| that brings residential open spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| and brings that kind of into harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| So there's an opportunity to really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| to raise the bar, we think here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| So we'd like you to consider interior sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| especially if this is in close proximity to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| not yet by pedestrian connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| but in the next five to 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| that's probably pretty likely that that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| So interior sidewalks seem good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Another one that could be really helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| would be possibly the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| I've won my KJS map here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| would be the entranceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| That's about 550 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| Right now, the current plan is simply for a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| with no sidewalk or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| It's just a road and then a grassy area off to one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| You could imagine that this is 550 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| where it could be a road that has trees on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| and then a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| It could be a nice boulevard to walk down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| to bicycle down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Ms. Murphy, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| So that's some improvement that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| We think peripheral setbacks should be the full 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| This is a rural area, it's a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| That should be something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| this is really to help the neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| And then finally, stub outs for future connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| That connects the subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| it creates issues where you don't have to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| two and a half miles to get to the neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| So I had a number of community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| who were watching you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| We look forward to a good discussion and your suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4991)|
| 1:23:11| And I'm sure you'll stand by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| because some commissioners may have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| Next at the top of the list is Ms. Porter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Naeem Porter, 221 Openview Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| I live about one mile away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| I live in a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| probably one of the only subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| that currently has interior sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| They're utilized daily, provide safety for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| And we just ask the same for any incoming developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| I will defer the rest of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| to either Mr. Thompson and Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| or wait until after the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Mr. Thompson, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| I know we-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Sorry, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Yes, Adam Thompson, 7643 Cotton Patch Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| Coryton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| I live in Harbison Plantation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| which is probably a half mile at the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| probably more like a quarter of a mile from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| And yes, I know we addressed this in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| back in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| but yeah, just to kind of echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| some of what Mr. Murphy said during the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| I appreciated some of the points that many of you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| I know Commissioner Phillips spoke about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| really the beauty of our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| and the reason that folks are moving out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| And when you get into higher dense developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| you really get rid of that landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| or you're losing the beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| that was the attractive for folks to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| I know we have, it's really close to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| so that's obviously an attractant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| but eventually our schools are gonna be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| And just like Commissioner Bussin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| and Commissioner Easton mentioned before and alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| eventually that demand is going to drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| and we still want this to be an attractive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| We want it to be an attractive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| We want it to be an asset to our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| that adds to the beauty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| that is still unattractive for folks to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| And it will remain to be a good investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| for the homeowners that are buying these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| We don't wanna look down 10 years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| and their home values haven't held up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| because, well, really it's not a desirable place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| to move anymore because they are cookie cutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| it's house upon house upon house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| And then when you're talking about sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| in Harbison Plantation, we don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| There's only one small portion of Edwards Place subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| that has a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Wheat Meadow, right next door to this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| which is the connector subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| doesn't have any sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| In Edwards Place, there's really not even a tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| in any of the yards because the houses are so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| And that one was only developed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| to three and a half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| This one's out to four and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| And so when you don't have amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| I know Commissioner Phillips alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| the common areas were really pretty disingenuous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| as far as dog parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| And when you don't have amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| and you have a 50-foot lot with a house and a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| you don't have places for kids to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| You don't have any place for kids to walk to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| to get out of the road because in the wintertime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| they're walking to the school bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| at Thompson School Road in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| It could be raining, it could be snowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| At the same time, folks are going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| It's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| And now in Mr. Davis's email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| he did address the sidewalk concern and said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| you know, if there were safety needs, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| He'd be willing to put in sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| but evidently in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| he didn't feel the need to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| but we are raising safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Mr. Thompson, about 20 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| And so, yeah, as far as amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| the cost of those amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| as Mr. Green had alluded to before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| really it's negligible in the cost of the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| For 187 homes, you're looking about $500 per house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| to afford these, you know, $50,000 amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| It's, you know, just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| it makes these developments more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| and an asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| So we just ask that you all can heed our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Ms. Niemeyer, and I'm sorry if I mispronounced your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| You got it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| I also live at 7643 Cotton Patch Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| Corrigan, Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| I would like to yield my time back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| to Kevin Murphy, post-opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| They addressed a lot of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Okay, Mr. Murphy, do you have anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| that you would like to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| No, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Okay, Ms. Porter, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| Yes, ma'am, I just also want to echo Kevin Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| in asking for you to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| for 30 days until the June meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| so we can get some more questions answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| and a more comprehensive concept plan with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| Okay, that's it for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| Hey, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| I appreciate your all's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| and I appreciate the comments and input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| from the citizens in the cornfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| We agree, we don't have any problem putting sidewalks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| on the Thompson School Road frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| where it would be most utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| if the connectors are made up towards the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| and that would provide a connector there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| on the Thompson School Road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| As was indicated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| there's no other subdivisions in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| and even the subdivision adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| that we'll be connecting to does not have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| So the sidewalks internal to our proposed subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| subdivision would go connect to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| And sidewalks, as y'all know, are expensive to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| and very expensive to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| I would respectfully request y'all approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| as per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5376)|
| 1:29:49| Janice, you need to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| I was saying, thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| That's probably one of the shortest rebuttals I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| from you since time on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| But it looks like Mr. Thompson, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| You guys probably have just a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Can you make it short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| Yes, I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Now, as far as Mr. Davis's comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| about the sidewalks leading nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| they actually would lead to Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| It's where we need them to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| because with the density of four and a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| children are in the road walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| And when folks are biking and jogging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| and utilizing this area with no usable yard space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| we need some amenities and access to Thompson School Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| so that our children can safely get to Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Before we go to commission, I'd like to ask Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| there is a lot of talk about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| I don't know whether I wanna call on Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| or Mr. Elliott from County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| There has to explain the county's position on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| I think Mr. Elliott, maybe that would be best for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| if you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| Yeah, Madam Chair, this is Jim Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| Senior Director of Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| We've been listening to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| and appreciate the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| We have checked this location in reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| to the requirements in the recently adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| County Commission sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| And it is our belief that this location does not comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| with sidewalks for internal connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| So we would not be recommending any sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| within the internal street network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| And my understanding again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| per the county sidewalk ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| that the developer could choose, opt to include sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| but then they would become the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| of the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| That is correct, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| In this particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| we feel as if the sidewalks would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| as a primary amenity to the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| rather than a transportation benefit to the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| So therefore, we feel as if the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| should maintain these and rather the HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| should be responsible should that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| the developer chooses and wishes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| And a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| if the sidewalk were put along the frontage of Thompson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| would that be county responsibility or HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| In this case, it would actually be the HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| just because that location isn't warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| per the ordinance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| If it was in the PRZ or if there were other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| I guess, guidelines that would warrant it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| then yes, we would be the responsible party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| But at this point, it would be the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| of the HOA due to the site conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Okay, and for those that may be new or listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| PRZ is a parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| And that is just as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| is that half mile from the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Is that correct, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| It varies per elementary and middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| But yes, it's one mile for elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| and one and a half for middle, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| I'm going off memory, but I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Okay, and the map that is showing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| is showing where the parental responsibility zones are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| So that being said, I see Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| I know that you did not use your full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| You've got your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5625)|
| 1:33:45| Did you have something you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| No ma'am, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| Unless there's further discussion or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Okay, Ms. Niermeyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Yes, I would just like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| you know, as far as the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| that just because we've always done it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| does not mean that it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| I think that we need to progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| and sidewalks need to be an amenity provided to these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| You understand that if sidewalks are included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| that it becomes the responsibility of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| that have purchased the houses in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| And I don't think there would be an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Okay, Mr. Murphy, you're gonna be the last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| before we go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| I guess I would urge commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| to think a little bit long-term on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| I think the map that Mr. Reynolds has showed up right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| It shows the important, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| this is a development that could be a connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| to additional property over towards the Southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| and possibly the South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| but you know, it could connect those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| as well to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| So this could actually become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| a more of a transportation corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| for pedestrian bicycle traffic for those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| So, you know, that plus the proposed subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| on Twin Oak Lane or the apartments that have been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| that you will be looking at next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| I think this is really the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| to think about the cumulative impact of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| and put together a little bit better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| So I think, you know, I urge you to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| until you can actually look at both of these concept plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| together next month and start to envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| how this could develop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Because we have to start somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| and this seems like a really great place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| We've got a unique opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| where a few pieces are developing at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| that are going to, could provide connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| So I've urged you to take that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5749)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Yeah, thanks Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I guess a couple of questions for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| Under the PR zoning, it calls for some amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| into the site and uniqueness of the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| Where do y'all see as staff, the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| and uniqueness of design on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| Well, from an amenity standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| obviously they're showing some open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| that's dispersed throughout the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| They're labeling it as dog parks, as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| And I believe what they're posing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| with just being open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| essentially that could really be used for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| So unfortunately we don't have anything that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| what type of open space or amenities have to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| So this is just what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| I mean, from a creativity standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| it's not much different than a lot of the other subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| We're predominantly looking at lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| and the road systems and there's really not another type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| of unique detail for this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| or development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| It's not too dissimilar from the existing Wheat Meadow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| development just to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| I had mentioned at agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| that this does look kind of cookie cutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And Mr. Davis, I apologize if I offend you in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| I don't think dog parks and in themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| just being common space with no amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| in terms of fencing or other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| would be considered an amenity issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| These are gonna be hopefully homes with children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| probably, or at least a good portion of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| And there's really no place for a playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| a pocket park, which I think is what the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| of the plan residential area design district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| And I think this project kind of voids that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| it lapses in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| So also the issue of the mailbox location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| that should be toward the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| toward the front of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| better access for the residents, easier to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| So I would like to see a revised plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| and would make a motion to postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| and see if we can't do a little better job on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| In terms of the sidewalks, I'd like to see sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| but the county has determined that's not necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| or advisable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| And so we're gonna have to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| But I would like to see some effort made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| in terms of some recreation opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| or a pocket park or two in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| They don't have to be large, half an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| could certainly be a nice element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| that add a lot of value and character to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| So you have made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| And second by Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| Commissioner Easton, you had your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I agree with everything that Commissioner Phillips said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| I do have a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| If even though the county is not recommending sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| for this subdivision and they are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| that the Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| would be responsible for maintaining sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| is there anything that says that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| cannot still require sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| Do we still have that ability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| Not that I'm aware of, I believe the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| or the commission could still require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| It's just like Jim's done said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| it would be up to the homeowners to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| Well, I'm having, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| I think sidewalks are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| I think pocket parks would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| I just don't think this current subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| really lives up to what we should be looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| in future subdivisions for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| Mr. Davis, I do see your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| I'd like to hear from Commissioner Buston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| and then I will hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| I agree with Commissioner Phillips and Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| I also have a problem with no sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| with this large of a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| I don't see really amenities for dog parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| And I understand where the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| what direction they wanna go with sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| but I also love Mr. Murphy's idea of postponing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| and looking at the connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| of the surrounding upcoming developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| because I think this could be really cool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| really great for the kids that they can walk to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| cut down on traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| We hear all the time in Hardin Valley about the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| trying to drop the kids off from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| I walked to school my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| I just think that this is just not the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| that we should approve at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| The other thing I'd like to ask staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| why are you recommending the setback reduction from 35 to 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6109)|
| 1:42:00| I'm not sure that the 30 extra five feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| is gonna make much of a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| in the end on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| but it provides a little bit extra space to put a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| and also accessory structures and such in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| We've approved similar requests in other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| and I just did not feel that this was totally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| just an inadequate request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| It was deemed reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| Mr. Davis, I know I said I'd go to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| but I see Knox County Engineering has got their hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| So I'd like to hear, I'm assuming Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Yes, Madam Chair, we'll defer to Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| and then we can add our comment later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| Scott, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| I just got my, wait, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6175)|
| 1:43:01| Yeah, I think a commissioner was-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6181)|
| 1:43:01| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Yeah, I believe another commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| was wanting to speak or someone was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| We do have several people with their hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| I had thought that you might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| do you want to hear all the commissioners before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| Oh, no, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| I'll be glad to address Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| and some of the other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| I have absolutely no problem at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| moving the mailbox center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| That is primarily dictated by the Postal Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| We don't have a great deal of latitude on where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| That was just one of the proposed areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| but the Postal Service will dictate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| and tell us where they think it's most suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| And so I don't have any problem at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| putting the mailbox center wherever it suits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| the Postal Service and the residents of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| In addition, I have no problem at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| making the area there between lots 34 and 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| a pocket park with a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| As you all know, in a lot of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| the homeowners associations come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| and decide what amenities that they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| are the highest and best for the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| and they'll come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| And so by leaving some open space areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| we're giving some latitude for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| to decide what was going to be best for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| once they put together their association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| But I don't mind at all in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| making that a pocket park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| And that was kind of the original intent to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| was to create smaller areas of common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| common space that could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| throughout the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| And the subdivision is designed almost identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| to the subdivision adjacent to it that we adjoin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| We tried to keep it consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| with the adjoining subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| I'm not in disagreement with any of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| made about amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| but keep in mind that amenities are in the eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| the beauty of an amenity is in the eye of the holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| You know, we talk a lot about affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| and both the city and the county mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| I think are interested in seeing affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| And I think each time one of us decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| that we think something could be prettier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| or we could add something to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| if we all did that, we'd have 15 opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| about what needs to be added to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| And I think the market can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| in the demand for the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| whether it's an attractive subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| I'm not saying we paved paradise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| I'm not saying that by any stretch of the imagination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| but we need to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| that each time you take away property from the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| each time you add an amenity to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| that cost is gonna get passed on down to the contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| The developer's gonna pass it on to the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| contractor's gonna pass it on to the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| to some of us, maybe $500 or $1,000 per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| is not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| When you have people that are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| for affordable housing, that can make the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| between whether they qualify or whether they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| So I just think we should keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| when we're talking about what we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| we should be adding to a subdivision development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Thank you, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| I just wanted to speak on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| that a commissioner said on a previous item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| that a lot of times what we decide sets a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| for the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| in regards to sidewalks in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| that while the county ordinance may not require it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| when we start to say that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| that can have an adverse effect in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| for surrounding properties as they become developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| Knox County Engineering, you still have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| We were talking internally about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| I think Ms. Easton's comment about the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| that Planning Commission chose to require sidewalks in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| We would need to consult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| and we certainly will consult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| with our law director's office regarding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| because it's our interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| that our ordinance would control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| what we can recommend and what we would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| So we'll follow up on that and let you folks know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| in regard to what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| Unmute your microphone, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6504)|
| 1:48:24| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| In light of the fact that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| is now not maintaining these sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| and it's gonna put the burden of the cost sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| of taking care of sidewalks on these residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| I mean, are we creating a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| where this property in here and anybody that buys in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| is gonna be at a disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| because they have financial dues and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| they have to fund to keep these sidewalks maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| when other developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| recreation to them don't have that same obligation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| And beyond that, I mean, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| I think that the most logical thing in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| is to get sidewalks to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| but look, I can't see how you connect this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| to the school without going through other people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| And I don't know how you can force that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| Although I do think sidewalks are nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| in the right situations, I'm not saying this is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| I just, I don't, I'm trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| how would you take sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| and get the benefit of connectivity to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| through numerous other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| that don't have easements or sidewalks available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| So just some things to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| on the sidewalk conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| I'm sorry, I forgot to lower my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Okay, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| I think Commissioner Smith, what you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| is a really good point to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| I think that considering this whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| over 20 or 30 years and what future developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| might come to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| because there's a lot of prime land here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| that you could find that sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| will eventually connect closer to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| Also the passing on of cost to homeowners is a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| I know a lot of people do not wanna live in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| where there is an HOA fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| because it's an additional cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| in addition to just purchasing the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| So, I mean, I know that ordinances have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| It could be worth it to consider switching that maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| and responsibility to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| That's a bigger issue, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| but as one of the, I think Ms. Miermeier might've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| or Ms. Porter might've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| that just because it's been done this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| doesn't mean it has to stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Ms. Miermeier, I do see your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| Yes, I would just like to comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| you know, you're talking about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| our residents can afford to maintain the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| but in my opinion, whether you're low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| middle income, high income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| we all deserve the same standard of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| And I think Knox County has stated that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| So as far as the HOA fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| I would gladly pay an HOA fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| if I knew my kids were gonna be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| Mr. Davis, you still have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| Oh, no ma'am, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| Okay, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| I do not see any other hands up at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| Yes, Mr. Graff, Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| I don't know how to raise my hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| so I just have to butt in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| But one thing on this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| well, all these dog parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| this is for Skye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| I might consider talking to the post office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| about having several postal places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| You don't need 187 people pulling up in their car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| to get their mail at the same spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| And if these are little places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| where you can put 20 mailboxes around the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| I think that the post office would think it was better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| to deliver to five or six areas in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| rather than 187.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| I mean, and as far as a dog park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| I don't buy that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| But the subdivision needs work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| I don't have a problem with 187 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| but to just line them up like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| I don't think is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| I wouldn't even care if you had some multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| in there, attached food boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| or to create some more space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| but that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| But I don't think this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| is what plan development should be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| Mr. Davis, you just took your hand down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| We do have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| second by Commissioner Graff to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| I think that we're gonna go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| and have Mr. Wise call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6822)|

| 1:54:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| Passes six to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| This has been postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| You have the other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| Yes, that's what I was getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| So the postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| so how do we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| I'm sorry, how do we handle this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6875)|
| 1:54:35| Because we are postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| we never had a motion on approving the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| or alternate site design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| or the concept plan or the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| Do we need a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| or do we need a motion and a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| on each of these four items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| I think you would be fine with a joint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| a motion for all the remaining items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| to be postponed collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| if that's the consent of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| Does somebody want to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| Can't hear you, Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| Although he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| Okay, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6928)|
| 1:55:28| And Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| Yeah, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| Okay, so the motion is just so to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| that we are combining all other recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| into one to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| Is that, did I kind of recap your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| a second by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| Mr. Crowder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6966)|
| 1:56:06| Mr. Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Mr. Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Mr. Graff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Mr. Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Mr. Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6975)|
| 1:56:23| Mr. Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| Mr. Talker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| Madam Chair, if I may have a comment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| In fairness to Mr. Davis, he's probably wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| how do I move forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| And I don't know how to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| Can I just, before you say that, just let me say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| for the record, the motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| OK, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| I guess I'm looking at Mr. Davis' side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| How does he move forward with this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| He's heard a lot of different comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| And we really haven't given him any specific direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| how to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| I mean, I agree on the postponement for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| I wish we could give him a little better direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| of how he needs to proceed so he can get approval next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7044)|
| 1:57:31| I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| Ms. Green, what is your suggestion with regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7054)|
| 1:57:41| to Commissioner Phillips' comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7061)|
| 1:57:49| I guess my easy answer is I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| that he's heard a lot of different comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| and trying to synthesize those into a direction is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| I think the primary ones I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| that are to better address the common areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| providing some common areas for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| The sidewalk issue, I think, is pretty mute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| because the counties tend to think that the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| Commission cannot mandate a sidewalk in light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| of the county ordinance about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| So I think just trying to better address common spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| work with the post office on relocating the mill center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| those seem to be the most realistic things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| He can talk to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| And I would suggest a meeting with the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| Mr. Thompson, Ms. Niemeyer, a few of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| and try to address their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| and comments from the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| A lot of what we do is dictated by the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| For example, the sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| And to some extent, the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| has bounds on what they can provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| can mandate in a new subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| And Mr. Davis meets the intent of the subdivision regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| Again, working on the common areas, the mill center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| I'd be happy to talk to Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| sit down, and try to come up with some other items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| that he might be able to address also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| No, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| OK, Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| I think Pat hit the nail on the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| and said exactly what I said a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| I think we can't ask developers to develop a subdivision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| is within the zone, within the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| It's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| The county has made it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| County Commission and the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| has made it clear that they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| want to blanket requirement for sidewalks and subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| And I think if you, we could all say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| well, we'd love to have a whole bunch of area for people to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| And we all like to have children's playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| But there's a certain amount of, what do developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| do moving forward when they comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| with the zoning and the density and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| that they are supposed to comply with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| So I think your question's perfectly on point, Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| How does he move forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| Apparently, he's got to please 15 people with what their idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| of what's attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| I think that part of this, too, was addressed at agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| When you go back and look at what is plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| supposed to be, what is this tool, and how can it be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| And I think it is up to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| to say when there's a development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| is presented to us, it is up to us to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| look and say, does this meet the criteria of plan development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| And it is up to us to say, and it's more than sidewalks, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7283)|
| 2:01:30| I'm sorry, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| It's more than just the sidewalks that are being addressed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| It is the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| And it is up to us to say, yes, we approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| or no, this doesn't meet what the expectation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| So with that being said, I think that Mr. Green did give Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7307)|
| 2:01:57| some direction with some things that could happen with his plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7317)|
| 2:02:04| and to bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| I would like to request a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| So we will take a recess and start back again at 3.42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7332)|
| 2:02:22| I think we still do have a quorum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| So we'll continue on and let them catch up when you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| So we're continuing on with agenda item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| The subdivision is Beeler Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| The applicant developer is DK Development, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| The location is the east side of Beeler Road, south of East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7366)|
| 2:02:53| The approximate acreage is 14.25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| The zoning, excuse me, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7377)|
| 2:03:11| Okay, that went down the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7391)|
| 2:03:18| Just to see if she's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| That just went down the wrong way, totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| The zoning is PR Planned Residential, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| The existing land use is residence and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| Proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| The number of lots is 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| There is one subdivision variance required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| There will be three motions and three votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| The staff recommendation is approve variance one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| because site distance constraints restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| with the subdivision regulations and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| Approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| and approve the development plan for up to 44 detached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| on individual lots subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| Assuming that's you, Mr. Kirby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| Okay, and opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| I'm assuming that's you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| Okay, Mr. Kirby, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| Sure, I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| I'm Dan Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Peel Box 10226, Tennessee 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| I did receive Mr. Murphy's letter and some of his information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| be it Tom Bretschko, just this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| but I think a lot of it's probably similar to some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| on the top of the school road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| So I'll go ahead and address these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| I'm actually going to take them in reverse order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| And one of Mr. Murphy's comments was that explain how this compliment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| concept plan implements the goals identified in zoning ordinance 51301,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| which says the regulations established in this zone are intended to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| optional methods of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| which encourage more imaginative solutions to environmental design problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| If you go back and look at the original submittal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| we actually showed taking the cul-de-sac all the way to the far east side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| There's a blue line stream that bisects the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| When that was identified by planning commission staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| we actually pulled the cul-de-sac back to the west side of the blue line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| stream and designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| That's about 1.5 acres in that northeast quadrant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| northeast corner of that as common area lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| So we have done some things to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| I wouldn't may not necessarily call them imaginative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| but we did address the environmental design problems with this properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| approximately 350 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Unfortunately it doesn't lend itself to a lot of imagination as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| but we think we've done the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| We've got a sufficient number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| We set aside the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| So we've done some things there that I think qualifies under 5-1301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| We've already heard about the sidewalks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| If you all are familiar with Beeler road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| if we could get a map up that maybe shows this in relation to where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| schools are, we're still, we're about a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| maybe a mile and a half south of where the Thompson school road project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| So we're a lot further probably from the school property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| And so I'll again, the sidewalk section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| the pedestrian circulation section of the subdivision regulations 3.05 says any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| required sidewalk should be provided by the developer in accordance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| design and construction standards of the city of Knoxville or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| And I believe during the review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| Knox County engineering made the determination that sidewalks wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| necessary there. The last item again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| which was number one and Mr. Murphy's letter was the connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| And I was just telling somebody earlier with our original plan that showed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| cul-de-sac going all the way to the east end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| One of the comments from the adjoining neighbors during the rezoning was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| you're not going to connect to the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| And so we saw that a little bit earlier in the car and situation where you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| this piece of property that they did stuff out the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| And then the developer comes along and wants to connect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| And then that neighborhood is not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| We have the same kind of the same scenario here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| You know, one other comment to that, it would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| a lot of times the neighboring farm owners don't like you showing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| connections that they have some concern that at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| maybe the County comes in and extends or condemned some right of way and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| and comes on to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| So it's sort of creates a little bit of conflict there. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| if I were going to have to make a connection, I would prefer that it be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| you know, are there on the East end of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| back off the cul-de-sac where we propose to access the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| And I'll just make one quick comment to the sidewalks and the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| And when you get down to having only 44, 45 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| it does get expensive to try to maintain these amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| And the first thing that happens when the developer's gone is every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| homeowner wants to figure out how they reduce their dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| And the way they do that is they, they stop taking care of the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Again, back to the current situation earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| if you read a lot of those reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| that road that gets stubs over to the property led to the old pool and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| clubhouse that was there for the original neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| And it, after some point they quit taking care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| dilapidated that people stole the wood off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| And so that's a lot of what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| I think maybe a better approach would be say, Hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| we're generating some tax dollars here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| Let's try to appropriate those towards maybe a local park somewhere in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| area where we know that those things can be taken care of and maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| And if I'm having time left, I'll, I'll reserve that to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7745)|
| 2:09:25| You need to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7765)|
| 2:09:26| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| I just told Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| Murphy that he needed to unmute and I didn't realize that I was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| All right, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Murphy, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Great. Thank you very much, Madam chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| It seems like we've got a pretty good grasp of what we're looking at in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| terms of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| I send out the separate email that talks about connectivity because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| thought this was actually a really good example of where a failure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| provide that connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Creates isolated communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| I understand there's two ways to look at connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| You can have one where people say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| I don't want people to come through my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| And you can have another view that says, well, the more connectivity we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| have, the more we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| Connected as a community and that we have opportunity to create things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| the future that we haven't thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| This example, which is also one side is down Beeler road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| I think pretty, pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| Useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| this was a subdivision over on the left is the first one that was put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| They did stub out connectivity to something future over here on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| A few years later when the subdivision on the right was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| They didn't, they put a call to sack in, but instead of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| they just put another lot in instead of actually making that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200514?start=7844)|
