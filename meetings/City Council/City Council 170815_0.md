| 0:02:38| 12P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| 12P is going to be postponed for two weeks, and that's okay with Mr. Seymour, and apparently the other council is not in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| So are you making that motion right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| I'm making a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| For 12P. Dealing with Midway. Okay. And that's at the request of the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Okay. We had a motion and a second on that. Okay. Is there any discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=185)|

| 0:03:16| Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to postpone 12A for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| This is a street names change, and the Public Property Naming Committee needs to review this, and I need to get with MPC on how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=200)|
| 0:03:30| But I talked with the applicant today and told him it was going to be postponed, and we're in the process of scheduling a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| So I'd ask that it be postponed for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Is that an honorary change or an entire meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| That's an actual change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Actual change in the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Okay. So there's a motion and a second to postpone for six weeks 12A. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=237)|

| 0:04:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Oh, it's a tie there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| It was a tie on the move to approve. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Any opposed? That consent item is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Okay. So for the Mayor's report, first, an update on our City Council elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| I do want to remind everyone that early voting is going on for the five council district primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| It began last Wednesday and it continues through Thursday, August 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| Then the actual primary election day is on Tuesday, August 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| And we're going to keep repeating this until November, what is that, 9th or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| Okay. So you can find information about the elections and the candidates on our website at GoVoteKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| And you can find out everything about early voting locations and their times at the website of the Knox County Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=301)|
| 0:05:09| which is KnoxVotes.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| You can also link to it from our GoVoteKnoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| I'm happy to report that so far we are seeing a significant increase in early voting over 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| which is the last time that these five seats were open with no incumbents running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Through yesterday, the 14th, we had 1,049 ballots cast in early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| And by comparison, in the first five days of early voting in 2009, there were only 403 voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| So from 403, we're at 1,049.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| That's a good start. We need to keep that pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| We need to keep that going through the rest of this campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| So we still want to encourage everybody in those districts to get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| If you haven't voted, please be sure that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| And tell your friends, your neighbors, your family members that they need to as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| and let them know where they can get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| And after the primaries, the top two vote-getters in each race will then run citywide in the November general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| Okay, I'll stop. I'll talk about this every two weeks just to prepare you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| We have several great celebrations coming up this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| These are the best parts of the job, and when we get to mark significant accomplishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| thank our partners and give everybody recognition for jobs well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| The first is celebrating the completion of the Knoxville's Extreme Energy Makeover, or KEEM as we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=393)|
| 0:06:42| We're celebrating this tomorrow, which is Wednesday, August 16th, at 9 a.m. at the Public Works Complex on Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=402)|
| 0:06:52| I hope you all remember that KEEM is our weatherization effort working with CAC and funded by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=412)|
| 0:07:01| We received grants of $15 million from TVA to make energy efficiency upgrades for low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| In the last two years through this process, we've weatherized 1,300 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| That's quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| That's 1,300 families that now have lower utility bills and less energy consumption in their home and for our community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| So please join me and our Sustainability Director Aaron Gill and representatives from all of our partner agencies to celebrate that accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=444)|
| 0:07:33| Again, that's tomorrow at 9 a.m. at our Public Works Complex on Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| I also want to remind you all that the ribbon-cutting for the Cumberland Avenue streetscape project is this Thursday, August 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=459)|
| 0:07:48| at 4 p.m. at the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center at the corner of Cumberland and 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| We invited Governor Haslam since this project started under his watch, and we carried it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=475)|
| 0:08:03| So he was excited to be here as well, and we actually arranged the date so it would work with his schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| So he will be here as well as other guests to mark the completion of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| It's been a long time coming, but I want to remind everyone that we are finishing on time and on budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=494)|

| 0:08:36| Also our contractors and our partners at KUB, along with all the merchants on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Everyone has really pulled together to make this work, and the event Thursday is a chance to recognize this and to thank everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=521)|

| 0:09:59| So, yeah, let's give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| Okay, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=609)|

| 0:10:29| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Thank you, Mayor. I know how the vote went last time on first reading, so I know this is going, but I guess I'm the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=630)|
| 0:10:39| I'm going to vote against this. I guess basically I'm just very satisfied with the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| I think it's a fair salary for a part-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| And the second reason is the resolution states it's inadequate and economic incentive to qualified individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=650)|
| 0:11:01| And we're doing this and we've got a council race with 30 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| I haven't met with all of them, but the ones I have met with I thought were very qualified and certainly a lot of different backgrounds and some really good people putting their name out there to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=665)|
| 0:11:17| So for those reasons, I'll oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Okay, thank you. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=682)|

| 0:20:28| We're getting applications and they're, for the most part so far, they're hooking up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| to KUV poles, but there are some issues with aesthetics, but the bigger issue here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1236)|
| 0:20:48| we at the city really don't have any expertise to deal with the opportunities or potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| problems in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| It will be very useful for us to go to a consultant to look at those opportunities especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| So you might be leasing space on a light pole or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Or a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Or a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| And they'll do the analysis to look at where there's need, where there's need coverage-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| and where there are opportunities on city assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| And this is happening in Nashville and this consultant is working there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Just a point, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| So you're going to get back an inventory list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Is that what you're going to get of poles and places and water towers and so forth that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| small cells could be located throughout the city or down the main corridors or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Yeah, and they will also do the analysis of where coverage is weakest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| so where there's really need, but also the inventory of potential mounting sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| and just some help with the policy on how to handle the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| and what flexibility we have and where we can go with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| how we can make the most of the opportunities and protect ourselves from the potential problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| So prior to that, are we just accepting, we don't have a basis to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| We have a policy on aesthetics, but most of the installations so far have been on KUB poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1343)|
| 0:22:36| so we have not taken advantage of any of the opportunities yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1365)|

| 0:23:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Councilman Dellivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| I see Don Distler rising to the occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| We've got a half dozen of these things on here, and some of them look a lot alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Would you tell us what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| We obviously are seeking grants, and we want electric buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| We want vehicles that are efficient to go out there and work in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| and other matters we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| But kind of lay the groundwork for where we're going with all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| what this grant program we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Don Distler, Director of Transit for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| These grants do look a lot alike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| the reason being is because we're kind of hedging our bets is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| It's real exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| We're looking to bring electric buses to Knoxville, to CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| This is kind of the next step, part of the next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| in supporting the ATMS project that's going on on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| that engineering got the grant for before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| And this will allow us to continue that forward motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| with the accelerated bus corridor service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| And we think that electric buses are just the wave of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| We have a lot of cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Less smoke coming out the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| There's no smoke coming out the back of them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| So this would allow us to provide a system that is perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| for the Broadway Corridor Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| And it will allow this to be the cool new buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| It's one of the busiest roads we have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| One of the busiest corridors that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| This will allow people to be able to jump on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| The bus will be moving quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| And this is just going to bring a whole new concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| and take CAT and transit just the next step further into the future for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| So the several grants, some of them may overlap functionally-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| but you're not sure whether you're going to get the grants or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| so you've applied to several sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| It allows us the opportunity to hopefully get some of the money from each source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| some money from each source, so that we can fund the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1532)|

| 0:30:40| Yeah, I wonder if Gary Holliday can tell us, this is an annual thing, we're using Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| as our field, in essence, expert to deal with animals, but go ahead and tell us what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| You said it correctly, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Otherwise, I would defer to the Law Director to go into more detail about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| This is a longstanding program, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| It's an annual amount that we give Young-Williams, as does the County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| I guess it does, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Okay, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| I didn't know if we were going up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Janet Testerman from the Animal Center, from Young-Williams, is also here if you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| I didn't know if the amounts were changing or if there's any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| This is the same amount as last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Is that right, Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Yeah, it's just pursuant to our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Our agreement with the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1888)|

| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| So the contract, Jim, the contract allows an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1895)|

| 0:31:37| Jim York, Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| This is more than prior year, but it's in accordance with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| There's an escalator clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| There's an escalator clause in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| All right, well, thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1910)|

| 0:31:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| 11U is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1918)|

| 0:32:13| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in the furtherance of the public purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| of the Board as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Councilman Dallivy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Yeah, we have Dawn Michelle, and she can tell us about this great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| As I understand it, at least from this paperwork, there's 152 residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| You're hoping to induce them to set aside 10 for moderate income workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| There's retail on the first floor and a parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| and I'm not sure what happens to the Crown & Goose's parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| whether it disappears or whether they move into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| but just tell us a little bit about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Dawn Michelle Foster, director and officer redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| This is a proposed 152-unit residential apartment complex with some retail at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| That encompasses the old southbound Barn Grill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| and then also the former Crown & Goose parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| I do believe Lee Birch is here as well to probably give you some more insight on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Where do they park during all the construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| It's also a two-level parking garage as part of this project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| But they'll be displaced for a while, I take it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| You mean the users of the Crown & Goose parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| There's parking under the James White Parkway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| So they'll have to find different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Public parking is not that far away from the former Crown & Goose parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| so I would assume that they would either use on-street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| or park under the James White Parkway, which is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Maybe this gentleman can add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Daniel Smith, 810 Henley Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Currently we have a month-to-month lease agreement with Crown & Goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| We expect to start construction on this project sometime in March and April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| At that time that we start construction, we would cease that lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| and they would have to find parking elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| What's the time horizon for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| It's probably going to be about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Actual construction once you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| So a year and a half from March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| and then we expect for a pretty quick lease-up period, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| and move on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| And this is a 12-year pilot where the dollars go to help reduce the loan cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| that would otherwise go into the coffers, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| It's a 12-year pilot, yeah, taxes are frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| and then you see the benefits, I think, in your packet of what that would. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| It goes to $553,000 sometime in the future when it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| Post-pilot, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| And the pilot is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Now, is there some trigger that they could lose the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| if they don't do what they said, or what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| How does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| If they don't, there will be a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| that will be written consistent with a commitment to the lower-cost housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| and if they're not consistent with that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| the pilot would then become null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| The taxes would be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| That's all handled in the formal agreement itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2117)|

| 0:35:20| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| In terms of the . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| This project will still go through the downtown design review process, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| I believe it already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| It has been through some workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| and also approved through the downtown design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2141)|

| 0:35:45| 11-V is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a limited-use agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| with 1921 Restaurant Group, Inc., DBA 19 Square Bar and Asian Kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| for the use of a portion of the city right-of-way as an outdoor dining patio area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| located adjacent to the building at 19 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Councilman Della Veppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Yeah, if we've got Rick Emmett there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| we've got about a half-dozen of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| and it looks like the last time we had a lease or license agreement, that's expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| so you're renewing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Just tell us a little bit about this and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| They don't actually have a right to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| It's a permission, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| And you can revoke it if you need the space for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Exactly, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Rick Emmett, downtown coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Yeah, these next five are all patios, all existing patios downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| We have 40 or 50 patios downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Most of them are temporary in nature, meaning you can move the railing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| move the chairs, move the tables very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| These five all have either a substantial base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| or some other issue with being on a right-of-way that's not as easily removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| although they would have to be removed if we asked them to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| But we bring those to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Three of these have been to council previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| and they had two-year terms, which have since expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| so we're trying to get those renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| We have a new one for the French market that just moved to Clinch Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| which is brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| They're building a platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Some of the owners are here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And then the other one is the great kind of bistro-style use of the market square space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| They get to step outside the building into the sunshine and have a few tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Yes, sir, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| And we think it adds a lot to the character downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| so we're very much in favor of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| And we're protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| They're supposed to name us as an insured, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| There's lots of insurance requirements and otherwise for these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2257)|

| 0:39:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| All the lights came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Oh, I want to talk about cycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Let's hear from Erin Gill to hear about the update on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| We've been working on it a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I've been involved with it, with them, the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| and a lot of work left to do, but a lot of work to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| So let's hear about it, Erin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| You have to rent your bike because the council fee is so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Well, I think one of the big complaints that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| people presume right off the bat today was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| we were investing millions of dollars like was maybe proposed or other cities have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| and that's not the case, is it, Erin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I'll let you tell the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| So Erin Gill, Director of Sustainability for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Bike-sharing has been a program that many of you may have seen in traveling to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| It's something that many communities have done to provide a sustainable transportation option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| for moving around downtowns between major tourist attractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| exploring a city in a more active, healthy way that's less relying on a personal vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| and more on pedal power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| So this has been something that community members have been interested in for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| It's been identified in our sustainability work plan as an action item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| and a service that would be of value to the city and fit within our sustainability goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| As Councilman Wallace alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| traditionally these models have relied on quite a bit of financial investment by cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| Essentially cities take on ownership of a fleet of bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| That's not exactly something that we were in a position to do in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| and I would say are not in a position to do currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| However, there's a group of companies out there who have a new type of model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| where it's bike-share as a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| And so as you can see from the contract description, they manage soup to nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| They own the bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| They deal with the interface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| They market it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| And because they're able to seek sponsorships from private sector companies, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| for these types of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| they allow cities to bring these partnerships to communities without financial investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| So that really changed the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| And as a result, we issued a competitive procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| to seek companies who are interested in providing these types of services on city right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Zagster was deemed the most competitive to that request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| And so we've moved forward with them under what's called a master license agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| so that they will have access to our right-of-way as they develop this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| which starts with a feasibility assessment and planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| to really figure out what this community would be in need of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| and what type of program would be most appropriate for a city the size of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| And then they would, under this contract, be able to use city right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| as they felt necessary to deploy the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I know Legacy Parks is involved to some extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| and I wonder if Carol would like to add to what's already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| Carol Evans, 3505 Kesterwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| I think it's a very unique partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| and it's a great opportunity with this particular provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| because of the not having to invest on the city part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| But there does need to be a collaboration liaison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| and so we're happy to serve that role so that there is an agency organization on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| to make sure that we're coordinating the work of the city with Zagster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| The next steps, I think what we have found, and I know Aaron did as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| is the ability to really tailor the services to your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| And so the opportunity, because the rider fees are not integral to sustaining the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| we have flexibility with this program to experiment with where we put kiosks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| We have the ability to tailor some of these rider services for visitor experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| We get to look at the corridors that we want to try putting bike share on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| So it is really a great model to sort of go in lockstep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| with what the city is looking at those corridors outside of the core of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| We can now complement that with bike share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| and the ability to serve some underserved communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| So it really has sort of, I would say, a three-dimensional benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| What we will do is just help with the initial steps in terms of sponsorships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| and how they fund that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| But they have been successful, and I think they have 175 different programs around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| and they're in 35 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| And their strength is mid-sized markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| so I think the selection by the city for them as a partner was they really did pick the right provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| Could you explain also their responsibilities, I mean, as far as maintenance and moving the bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| and the logistics of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| That's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Yeah, as Aaron said, it's really a soup to nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| They'll hire locally mechanics as well as those at services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| And a big part of the bike share is redistribution of the bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| so that they all don't end up with 40 bikes at one kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| So they will be in the car all day long both maintaining and redistributing those bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| But it is a very technology-savvy system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| We have the opportunity to select a variety of bikes so that we could have handicap assist bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| We can have tricycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| We can have a variety of bikes that serve our need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| So they're very forward-thinking in how they've developed their program, but we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| They are constantly redistributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| And I was telling Vice Mayor Grieve, very heavy on analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| So you'll be able to monitor the success almost daily of the most routes used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| the most kiosks used, where people are commuting to and from, how visitors are using those bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| So I think it will give us a lot of ability to very customize that program to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| I'm wondering, this may be a question for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| It might work for Aaron or someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| But what happens if we have a lot of bicycles that start riding on the sidewalks downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| the streets are kind of crowded with traffic and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| I think they're supposed to be in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| But what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| You're going to have fast-moving bikes and slow-moving people that might not mix well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| So how do you deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| We're looking at each other trying to decide who wants to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| He's going to give them a ticket, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| I think part of, as Carol mentioned, the vision for this is primarily centered, but not exclusively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| but centered around the downtown, which is an area that is much more bike-friendly than some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| And so I think that, as always, there's a need to educate riders on appropriate rider behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| And messages can be built into the interface that people use to rent out the bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| So that being said, as we see in other cities, a lot of users will gravitate toward places where bike infrastructure is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2793)|
| 0:46:42| That's where they're comfortable riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| Meaning greenways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Greenways, yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| Greenways, bike lanes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| So we're not thinking of this amenity as much for commuters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| so much as people who are trying to get from point A to point B within their experience of places to visit within Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| Is it market square where they'll have bike racks and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| Yeah, it's too soon, as Carol mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| So I would not want to presume exactly where these would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| but the vision of them would be focused on those types of amenities in our city for visitors, tourists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| as well as those who live here who are coming downtown to experience what we have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| That would be focal points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| So how do you move, for instance, from Volunteer Landing to Iams Nature Center or Century Landing Park, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Police have any suggestions or just a document made out of line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| We, of course, would work with the city, work with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| I'm sure they talked about doing analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| A big piece of that would be if they need to increase the bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| do they need to make it more easy for these folks to use the bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| We, with our officers' discretion, will understand that it's a new program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and we'll work with them to make it work overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Will you have more bike officers to help people do the right thing and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| How do you deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| That's more public education than it would be having more officers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| And, of course, our safety education unit can work with the city to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| How about signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Is there any plans for signs that will encourage certain kinds of safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| I'd have to pass that one off to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Oh, that's Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Well, so in general with this contract, we are not under this contract committing to do that type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| So let me be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| I think that as we have the analytics available from a program like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| we are better able to coordinate our infrastructure investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| So you're going to work all that out, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| You're going to work all that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| That's the idea is that we'll be able to have a program that we can build future investments around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| So how are the bikes, how are they secured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Is that a problem in some cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| Carol, I don't know if you want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| I can certainly try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| There's an element built into the bicycle itself to make sure that it can be secured to its station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| There's GPS, too, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Yeah, sort of probably what the Zagster people say, or every bike share person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| is nobody really wants to steal that bike because it's not a bike you're going to resell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| So they have found that that's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| It is secured by a lock, and you actually go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| It's app-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| They do have the ability for people without a phone to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| but it actually is locked, and then it automatically unlocks and is secured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| but it is also tracked by GPS so that they know where their bikes are at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| But for them, and again, that's their risk, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| So they maintain inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| They'll have to replace the bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| So as a company, they've sort of worked out the kinks on theft so that they can maintain a healthy company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| but they have not found that to be a problem because they're really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| It's kind of a heavy kind of a bike you're not going to be able to fence, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| is how they looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| Thanks, Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| 12B is an ordinance to close a portion of an unnamed alley from the northwest corner of parcel 082-IA-025| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| and the northeast corner of parcel 082-IA-024| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| and authorizing the mayor to execute quit-claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's Travis Tillman Applicant 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3028)|

| 0:53:06| but they own the surrounding property and are leaving the vegetation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| So that's part of the overall plan for this property, is to have the hotel with a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| to the residential, which is to the rear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3194)|

| 0:57:37| or Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3457)|

| 0:57:45| and there's been a shakeup in the world of retail, so they're trying to energize it with several things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3465)|

| 0:58:10| east of East Governor John Sevier Highway, from C3 District to C4 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| Rita Newbert, Statewide Realty, Incorporated Applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3495)|

| 0:58:24| Yeah, I was just going to ask Gerald Green, what's the normal reason for going to C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| Usually it's an outdoor display type zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| I'm not sure how this fits in with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Gerald Green, MPC, the applicant wishes to have a produce stand and bake shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| and there will be some produce and materials displayed outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| So there might be tables or some kind of activity, a covered porch or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| But once you start putting things outdoors, you need that display right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| That's correct, and that's one of the limits of our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Only the C4 allows that outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3539)|

| 0:59:44| He called in, so apparently he did not make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| So there's no further business and we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170815?start=3587)|
