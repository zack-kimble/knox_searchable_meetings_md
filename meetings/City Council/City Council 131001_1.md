| 1:20:10| SCOTT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Clingman's Dome Drive and drove through that area to look at the site where the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4811)|
| 1:20:20| would be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| And I want to ask, I guess Mr. Hageman, we've mentioned, a couple of people have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Have we done any official traffic study down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| My understanding is that over the course of the development of this area there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| a couple of traffic studies done for this proposal and Mark might be able to give some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4838)|
| 1:20:49| better information on this than me, but usually the traffic studies for a big change like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| this would come at the use on review stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| So there has not been a traffic study, there has not been a traffic study done for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| particular proposal because it isn't that far along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| Making a left back on to North Shore could be a little dicey down there, that is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Well, those are a couple of questions that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Did you have more to add, Mr. Hageman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| I might note there have been a lot of changes made in order to handle that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| There's two lights and some widening, so there have been some changes to adapt to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| the amount of traffic that has been generated in general by this development, so it's hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4899)|
| 1:21:48| to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| I mean, everything hasn't really settled down yet, so, and as I said, it hasn't been analyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4909)|
| 1:21:58| for this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Right now, I am not prepared to vote favorably on this project, but I obviously couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4925)|
| 1:22:14| help but think as we went around and listened to my colleagues talk, is it worth postponing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| Is there going to be a conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| That hasn't occurred yet, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| And that's been my main difficulty with this whole thing, because Mr. Seymour certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| knows, just like Councilman Della Vopi indicated, of our desire for neighborhoods or surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| areas and development proposals to meet somewhere in the middle and talk things out, and often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| and I know personally, of developments that have come a lot better as a result of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| So, I'm kind of scratching my head, thinking, is this worth kicking down the road three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| meetings or two meetings or something to allow the parties, I'll have to ask the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| My clients are saying yes, or nodding yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| Well, I'll tell you what, I can make a motion to postpone, and let's see where it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| so I will make that motion to postpone for, what, three meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| That would be, what, six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| What about the residents, are you going to ask them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Okay, does anyone want to speak to that motion to postpone for six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| Councilman Grave, would you like to speak to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| I want to speak in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Well, you can speak for or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| I had a conversation with Mr. Seymour this afternoon, which was that if the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| being the neighborhood, if they were concerned only about the design guidelines, that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| could be taken care of, and I think that they have made an attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Please pull your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| They have made an attempt, do I need to start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| They've made an attempt to reach the guidelines, but also what Mr. Seymour told me was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| if the question was density, and if it was the fact that they would not accept, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| neighborhood will not accept 248 units, then they might as well pack their bags and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| And so the real question is, if density is the issue, and if the developer cannot make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5069)|
| 1:24:37| the project go with 160 units, which is what's required, then whether we postpone it six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| weeks or not, it's going to waste everybody's time, and it's not going to do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| So I think that's the real question, is that the guidelines, yes, can be looked at, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| the density seems to be the real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| I also want to emphasize that, again, as far as the site plan goes, I don't want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| out there what I see at the corner of Dean Hill and Morrell Road, which is the great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| pyramid of walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| And when I look at this plan and realize that between the apartments and the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| there's a 12-foot high wall and all the asphalt, and I'm not sure what the height of the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| is, the new wall, between the apartment complex and the school, because there's no elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| on the drawing I've been given, that we all need to remember that this is an introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| into that whole neighborhood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| And to take a site that has contours and curves and different elevations and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| put a flat unit complex on there is, first of all, it's not going to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| And secondly, I think it's a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| But I think the real issue is if the neighborhood is saying that, no, they don't want to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| the density beyond 160, I don't know that it's worth waiting six weeks, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| that's something we can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| Yeah, if that is the issue, I will withdraw my motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5162)|
| 1:26:19| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| We've heard a lot of conversation tonight about density, about 160 units, about 248| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| units, and about the fact that the town center concept works when there is density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5187)|
| 1:26:34| It could be, or I don't really think, having looked at town centers fail throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| nation because they didn't have the density that they needed to support the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| I really think that we need to wait the three meetings and give an opportunity to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5205)|
| 1:26:52| can be done as far as density and as far as the appearance of this concept and working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| with the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| I do know from having talked to Mr. Donaldson that it's taken a few weeks for the town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5220)|
| 1:27:09| concept and Flournoy folks to all get aligned, and as I understand it now, they do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| better understanding of what's involved with the town center concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| I also think that if we say, well, 160 is it, that's the end of the line, then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| going to have this 10 acres of land sitting there vacant for a long time, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| that that's probably not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| And I really would appreciate if everybody in the audience was polite to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| We'll ask the audience to please act respectfully to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Yeah, I just, I guess Finbar had asked the developers if they were interested in talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| Maybe the spokespersons that were for the opposition, if they would, Ms. Stevens or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| someone else, if you would step up and just address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| I know there's a certain amount of frustration from being ignored for several months, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| we're here now, and the question is, is there something productive that can be done so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| the community has sort of its say and see if there's any move, give, or compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| in your all's viewpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| Well, we have worked with many developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| We've worked with Bud Cullen and Jim Harrison on the Publix and the Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| We worked with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| In fact, the school configuration was completely flipped as a result of Mike Stevens' suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| at a neighborhood meeting, so you are correct in my frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| I advised the Florine folks in their meeting with the MPC in July of the 60 pages of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| guidelines that were of record and said, this is what you need to comply with, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| apparently now have just figured out what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| I'm certainly, and I think on behalf of all the neighbors, we'd be willing to talk, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| not at 240 units on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| I wasn't challenging the substance, but do you think there's something productive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| could be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| We're wasting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Well, so far, the only discussion I've ever had with Florine is they're unwilling to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| We've always been willing to discuss density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| I think there should be further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| You've got a developer here that wants to develop the property, and you can work it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| out if you get time, if people are willing to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| I'm definitely in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| I was in support of that on Monday morning to try to work, give them time, and it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| to take time, so I support the motion and give them six weeks and see if we can't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Actually, the motion's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| I would like, I think there was a question about whether the ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| You've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| I've been informed the motion is still on the table because the second was not removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| You were going to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Yeah, Councilman Grieve, I was going to ask the developer, or to Arthur, did you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| to speak to whether density was on the table for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| I think that was kind of the question that was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Jeremy Brewer with Florinoi Development Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| It sounds to me like there's concern from the council that there's just not enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| at this time and that plans came in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| I think those concerns are valid, and I think we can work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| I personally don't think six weeks is even necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| I think we can get together with the neighbors and with city staff and whoever else needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| to be there and get something, try to do our best to work with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| We've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| We've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| I've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| I think we can give it a shot, and so I would very much appreciate the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| and I know we can get you more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| We can address the retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| We can address the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| We can show you, hopefully, what every one of them is going to look like by that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| and also address the neighbors' concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| I guess the question asked was, was density on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| That's the question on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| I suppose it's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| I don't know what we can agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| My understanding is that we could do 160 units, so if that works, I guess there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| be no reason to come back in four weeks, but we can talk to them about it, and I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| commit to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| These projects do need to make sense financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| We know what happens when they don't, and so we need to adequately staff our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| apartment communities, and we need to provide amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| We need to provide landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| We need to do the things that make these attractive parts of the community, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| does require density, but if we can talk to our neighbors and come up with some solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| that maybe do make sense for both sides, maybe we can come back and present something, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| at least then you'd have a clear idea of what it is you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| I think you just answered my question, and Councilman Grieve mentioned, of course, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| 160, and it appears that you are at least willing to look at 160 units, and that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5551)|
| 1:32:40| be helpful, so I think you just said that, so I'm going to withdraw my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| May I say something about what he just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Councilmembers' calls upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Vice Mayor Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Well, I think this is exactly the same scenario that we had in South Knoxville with Gumpert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| with his project, and, Will, I think most of the members of Council attended the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| at South Knox Elementary, and there was a room full of people that were very angry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| very angry about the proposed development, and it was about the same numbers, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| a year later, over a year later, you know, Mr. Gumpert has come back, and he's worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| with the neighborhood, all the neighborhoods surrounding, not just Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| He's worked with the city staff, and now he's got a project that is being, unless I'm being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5606)|
| 1:33:34| wrong here, but it's being accepted by the community, so he did the things necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| so I think there's a, I think we should give them a chance to at least get around the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| and I appreciate Councilman Saunders bringing that up, making the motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| I mean, I don't know of any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| If they can't, and if it's a density, then we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| We hang it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| But I think that it's reasonable for people to get around the table, and the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| has said that they're willing to do that, and I know that, you know, everybody's voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| and wanting to vote no tonight, but I think that we need to give each side at least one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| more chance to get around the table and find a project that will add to the tax rolls of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| the city of Knoxville, that will help the development, help the commercial side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| it, and add to the residential as well, so I'll support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| Well, I'll call on Frank Slagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| He can come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| Thank you, and just for a point of clarification, I think the vote tonight is to rezone the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| If you vote no on the rezoning, it still can be developed with 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| We're not asking you to not allow apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| We're just asking you not to allow it to be rezoned where it could be 250 apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| and then get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Once you've done that, anything can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| We're just asking tonight to vote no on the rezoning, and we will be glad to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| the developer, although we met with them 100 days ago and haven't had a chance to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| to them since because they keep telling us no more density is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| So we've been stiff-armed for 100 days, and it looks to us like the only reason they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| interested in talking about it now is because this was slipping away tonight, which is suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| George thinks I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| It's not a theory if it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| If you will vote no tonight on the rezoning, we can still develop this property with 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| All we're asking you is not let it get bigger than that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| It's already zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| It's zoned where you can have 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| Leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| We've been through enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Please don't postpone this any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| They have drug us around for all summer, stiff-arming us and avoiding us and not talking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5752)|
| 1:36:00| Just because they're going to lose doesn't mean they should get an extra period to keep fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| Please vote no on the rezoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Don't postpone it any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Let them build 160 units, and like I told Arthur, I'll be there with the shovel and the champagne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| We're not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Just don't let it get any bigger than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| I have a question to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| The comment about density having to stay at 248 with the conversation we had this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| In other words, the property is zoned for 160, which you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| And now what you're asking for with the rezoning is to do away with the guidelines and to do 248 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| So we know that seems to be part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| The other problem is what Vice Mayor Pavlis has said is the total lack of communication between the groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5813)|
| 1:37:01| and also as far as us having information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| I kind of find it a little difficult to understand that with you folks developing as many projects as you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| and the quality of the work that you do, and you all do do good projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| that you didn't understand the guidelines until recently, since we started this some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| So I'm having a little difficulty with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| But I do want to know if density is the question, then we can take care of this tonight and move on to other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| Yeah, I think to answer the density, with the price that we're paying for the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| and the economics of this specific site, we can't do 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| Now, is there a number that's less than 248?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| You know, we'll have to analyze that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| But, you know, I can stand here tonight and tell you that based on what the deal is with the land owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| and, you know, he's expressed to us, you know, Ben represents him that he can hold this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| And so, you know, unfortunately, we just can't do 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Now, is there a number a little bit less than that that we'd be willing to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| Possibly, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Well, the conversation we had in my office a couple of weeks ago before this came up the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| was the fact that it appeared that in order to make the project work, you had to have at least 250 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| with the analysis that you did at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| And if that's still the case, then that's where we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| Yeah, I mean, look, I'm not going to stand here and tell you that we can get it to 180 either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| You know, if, you know, obviously, if density and, again, what a lot of the comments that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| and, you know, I think that Ryan may have heard when he met was, you know, town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| And we feel like we've come, you know, a long way on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| And, you know, whether we, you know, we can look at it and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| can we draw X number of units, you know, to get this to work with the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| You know, we're willing to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| But I can confidently tell you we can't do 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| Cannot do 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| I mean, just the economics of the deal will not work in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| Had the school not been built there, there is a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| I've tried to count what you could potentially have done between the school site and this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| or transfer development rights from another piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| There were contemplated, I think, well over 400 residential units between the school site and this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| Now, the school site's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| There are no development rights that can be transferred to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| But how many acres is the school sitting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| At least ten, I would think, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Eighteen acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| That's 28 acres to divide all those units over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| Now what we're trying to do is we're trying to squeeze down to ten acres and put 258 units on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| Unfortunately, they have to answer to their lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Whether they can do 180 or 220, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6003)|
| 1:40:11| That's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| They have analyzed 160 units for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| And can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| I've got to believe that as we talk and go, as you know, our plans were recently changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6021)|
| 1:40:28| And we're now looking at a different building type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| I think we're going to need to really evaluate construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| And some other factors will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| But we just don't know right now what would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| But I think, just thinking to myself, I know construction costs are going to play a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| Because this is a different building type and a different building material than what we had originally submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| It's likely to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| And, you know, we should have a better handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| I appreciate the fact of, I mean, I understand the construction costs and that sort of thing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| But, again, what we understand is that the neighborhood is concerned about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| I'm concerned about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| I'm concerned about that site in terms of what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| And with all due respect, I do believe that that site will be eventually developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| It may not be this year, but it will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| And I think that sometimes we have to look at the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| and the quality of what we're looking at in terms of the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| and not necessarily the bottom line, which is the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| And I'm not against having more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| But I think, at the same time, we need to look at the types of projects that are being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| and where they are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| So that's a concern that I have about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| Okay, so we right now have a motion to postpone for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| I'm ready to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| We're going to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| Councilman Stayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| Okay, the motion to postpone six weeks passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| We'll be back in six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131001?start=6141)|
