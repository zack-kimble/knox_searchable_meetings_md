| 0:00:00| Before we actually officially begin tonight and before I ask Miss Pelow to give the invocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| I want to begin by, I guess, beginning with the obvious event that has impacted our city so much this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=6)|
| 0:00:19| You really can't put into words what happened to the families, to that church community, to our city at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=19)|
| 0:00:29| And I want to begin by expressing the city's compassion and care for those families and for that church family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=29)|
| 0:00:36| which is noticeably and understandably grieving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| I also want to thank our law enforcement personnel who did outstanding work in every way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=41)|
| 0:00:49| And I've always been proud of them, and I was as proud of them the last two days as I have ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=49)|
| 0:00:57| And our fire department who came in and did a wonderful job of helping out the church in lots of very significant ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=57)|
| 0:01:04| And I also want to thank the members of the congregation who kept a terrible situation from becoming even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=64)|
| 0:01:12| We are all in their debt for, I guess, like I said, limiting what is just a horrible, horrible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=72)|
| 0:01:22| But I know I speak for those on council and others might want to say something as well in saying that the entire church family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| and those families of the victims have our sympathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| And I want to say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| You know, unfortunately, when you have an incident like this, it draws a lot of attention to your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| And it brings a lot of national media that are saying, well, is this who you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Tell us, you know, is this what the city of Knoxville is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| And I could say without a doubt that's not who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| That one of the things that we are working on the hardest as a city is to be a city that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=112)|
| 0:01:59| while not giving up our own convictions, works very hard to live with our deepest differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| And whether those differences be in the public square that we're in now or in the marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| or in our religious convictions, whatever it is, we're a city that's working hard to live with those deep differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=133)|
| 0:02:22| And despite the act of one irrational person, I have seen a city that has reacted incredibly well in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=142)|
| 0:02:32| And I'm very proud of everything from the service last night at Second Prez, which was overflowing, literally overflowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| I'm glad the fire marshal wasn't there, to the service today at First Baptist at noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| to a hundred other things that I could tell you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| And so we want to begin by acknowledging a horrible event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| but also by being grateful for the city that we have and the way that it reacted to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| I'm going to let council members that want to say something, if you would like to say anything, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| I'm going to ask Ms. Pelow to lead us in the invocation in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| If anyone would like to, you don't have to, obviously, or you can during the mayor's report or your council report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| Okay, we will ask Ms. Pelow to lead us in the invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| I'll ask the vice mayor to lead us in the pledge, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| If you'll all stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| Let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| I think a moment of silence and an opportunity to express your feelings and your own thoughts and your own words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=208)|
| 0:03:40| and your own space for just a moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| Our Father, you know how well we come to you tonight with very heavy hearts and deep sadness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=228)|
| 0:03:59| profound concern for the families of the victims, for those who are part of that loving congregation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=239)|
| 0:04:12| for those who happen to be visiting on a very special day and who found them a part of the grief of that congregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=252)|
| 0:04:23| We're so grateful for the people who, from another congregation next door, your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| who gave their love and their support in a time of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| We're so grateful for all of the wonderful people that we have in Knoxville who every day are there to make our lives safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=275)|
| 0:04:45| and to make our community a better community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| We're grateful for their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| It's been a difficult two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| You know we're drained and we're spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| But you know that we are so grateful for your grace, your forgiveness, your comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| And we just pray that somehow we may all be open to the love that you would have us to continue to share in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=305)|
| 0:05:15| with our neighbors, with our friends, and, yes, with those whom we do have differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| but who we know are your children and who you would want us to comfort and to express our concerns for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=322)|
| 0:05:33| We're here tonight to praise you also for Councilman Hall's recovery and that he can be back with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=333)|
| 0:05:42| It's wonderful to see him when we know that you had uplifted this family in their time of great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=342)|
| 0:05:51| And we are so grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| We thank you for the many blessings, many that we take so for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| Life itself, for the people who love us and who we have the opportunity to love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| We pray that you will help us to be a city of love, a community of love, a neighbor who expresses love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=368)|
| 0:06:17| a friend for those who are so in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| We are grateful for our experience in your comfort and love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=383)|
| 0:06:33| And we know that that will extend to many other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| And we know that that will bring the healing that we all so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| We pray in the name of our creator who gives us all of the blessings that we need to sustain life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=404)|
| 0:06:54| and make it so meaningful on this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| indivisible with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| I do want to officially welcome back Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| It is great to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| We obviously miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| And I think it says a lot about your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| I think it says a world about your commitment to your job as a council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| that less than four weeks after an incredibly serious accident that you would be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| I know it's uncomfortable and painful, but we are grateful that you are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| And we really want to know that we appreciate the effort you've made to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I'm glad to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| I believe he brought probably a chauffeur with him tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| It's good to see Janet sitting out there, and it's good to see you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| We're glad you're here, Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=483)|

| 0:08:23| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of July 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Any abstentions, comments, additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Yes, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Yes, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Item number, we've got this updated agenda, so I need to find mine that was before I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| the updated one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Item number, hit me up Ms. Poplar, 9A, the withdrawal of 9A at the request of the Administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=533)|
| 0:09:04| Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Yes, withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| And just as a little quick backdrop, in talking with the Administrative Elections, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| he's probably correct here, with all the other questions on the ballot this fall, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| state election, with the county election, with the presidential election, with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| charter amendments on there, this actually would have been adding a city question, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| would have been adding another layer on top of this election, which could have been kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| of confusing to the voters, and so we're looking at probably coming back in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| There will also be one more resolution or ordinance that will come forth with regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| to what's already set for the election, but we'll bring that probably in the next two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| weeks, but we're withdrawing this one for right now at the request of the Administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Anything you'd like to add to that, Ms. Poplar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| I know she's been in discussion with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| It's just that this amendment being withdrawn, the underlying ordinance is still in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| and that's what will need to come before you for rescission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| All those in favor of withdrawing 9A, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Anything else to be, Ms. Pelow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I was thinking you were moving on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| We will move on, then, seeing no other likes, to postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| I would like to request a postponement for four weeks for item number 10A, and along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| with 10A goes, well, Vice Mayor, 11B, and that would be a postponement requested for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=628)|
| 0:10:37| four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Mr. Blattner is in California, and he has requested that postponement, and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=638)|

| 0:12:40| Two quick items for a mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| This afternoon we celebrated the completion of the three-year renovation of Lonsdale Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| that KCDC completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| It's really, really well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| It's a great-looking project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| If you hadn't had a chance to drop by there, please do, but it looks terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| And last week we had, I think a lot of, I know a lot of council was there, we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| public meetings on Downtown North and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Both were very well attended and there was a lot of good discussion and good support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| So I want to thank those council members who were there and those who couldn't be for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Okay, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| I just want to announce, actually invite everybody to the Lonsdale Homecoming this coming weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| Wonderful event in one of our oldest historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| A lot of people, a lot of really good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| Saturday all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| The parade's, I think, at 10 Saturday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Meetings go all day Saturday, Sunday morning, and Friday evening as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| So you all come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| I can't make it, so I'm expecting several of you all to show up and hold the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| flag firmly high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=825)|

| 0:13:48| Just be careful if Vice Mayor Brown gets in a race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| That is the site of my victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| I'm undefeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Catherine Brunson from the Metropolitan Drug Commission sent me an email regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Governor's Volunteer Star Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Those nominations, they just received information about are due August 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| They invite anyone who, in our viewing audience who's here today, who might be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| in finding out more about that to please look at www.metrodrug.org, which is their website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=856)|
| 0:14:24| to check it out and see if you can think of anyone or have any idea of anyone who you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| would like to nominate for the Governor's Volunteer Star Awards, which is actually chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Also, and I'm not sure if someone here on council has the information or the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| I got a copy of the AT&T petition where they filed a petition, a new cable bill to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| But one thing I did not get, and I'm not even sure who sent it to me, was the attachments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| which show the geographic build-out, and I didn't know if the administration had received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| that or if the law department has that, but I'd like to get a copy of those exhibits so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| I can see where they are proposing to do their build-out under the new state cable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| And I don't know if anybody else got it, but all I got was the petition, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| We have received a letter that I think Janet Wright and Ron Mills have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| I have not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| I do not know what's included in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| There are some things that are required of us to respond back in regard to certain channels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| and things like that, and that's what Janet and Ron have been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| So if anybody has it or has any idea of what their exhibits, the petition mentions exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| which identify the geographic build-out and those kinds of things, so I'd be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Can I just ask a question that involves your request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| I was concerned about that, too, because I have received a couple of emails which indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| some concern about a particular area in the city that is not included in their build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| plans, and some requests for support to ask that that area be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| Perhaps that's what you had in mind, Councilman Brown, and I think it would be a terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| omission of this council not to look at that carefully and have all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| So I think we would probably all appreciate having that material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| We will look into it and get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| I haven't seen that either, but we will try our best to see if those exhibits are around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| I just wanted to mention that if you're driving or planning to drive through West Hills early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| on Saturday morning, you might notice a group of people scantily clad, that sounds interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| who would be running as hard as they can up and down those hills and looking for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| So it is the annual Gazebo Run, West Hills Gazebo Run, and this year it is particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| exciting because the funds that are raised from that run are going to go to the improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| of the tennis courts, which we're all committed to, and it's pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| So we want to thank everyone who's participating, and we want to welcome you all to come if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| you want to see a bunch of sweaty runners and some cute little kiddos that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| to be doing the little walk with the run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Thank you so much, and thank you to my fellow council members for supporting that with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| of your discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| First, I was wanting to welcome a good friend back to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| I've enjoyed knowing him for a number of years, and he's been missed recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| I'd like to welcome Mayor Haslam back to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| No, in all seriousness, I would like to welcome back my friend and colleague, Steve Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| Everybody's been thinking about him, praying for him and his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Steve's been put through a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| His family has certainly been put through a lot, too, and when myself, Bob Becker, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| Marilyn Roddy went down there, there wasn't a place to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Steve had so much love and family there with him, and that says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| Looking forward to, we talk on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| What's funny was the other day I was talking to him, and somebody was sitting there beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| him, and he finally figured out that Steve and I were talking, and there was a shout-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| that I heard on the phone, quit breaking the Sunshine Law, and it was Mr. Lumpy Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| I told Steve, I said, tell him we're talking about broken bones, not breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| But it's glad to have Steve back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Second thing, certainly more seriously, about the awful situation on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| A lot's been said about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| We've got friends and neighbors, like probably everybody up here does, that attends that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1133)|

| 0:26:35| and it just strikes me that perhaps a lot of people did not know his generosity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1595)|
| 0:26:44| and how many, many, many people he fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| And I got to know him because we were working with the shelter adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| and it was just incredible to me over the years to think what all Harold had meant to many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| who were having some difficulties, and he didn't ask anything in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| He was just there for him, a dear man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| And, you know, he was a legend, and he truly, truly laid a path for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| and I think that needs to be noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1635)|

| 0:27:47| I just want to point out, I mean, a lot of people think the fourth district is Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| It's a lot larger than Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| It's Aliceville, Spring Hill, and it goes out and East Town Mall area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| and it includes part of East Knoxville, which I'm certainly proud to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| But when I saw the article in the newspaper almost a couple of weeks ago that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| Walgreens was doing these clinics, I thought that was, you know, a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| It would be a good way to give people quick and relatively fairly priced access to medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| Then I started noticing the places that they were serving and noticing the places they were not serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| You know, folks in East Knoxville, East Knox County for that matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| deserve the opportunity to have these services provided to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| There's a fairly new Walgreens in East Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| The old one is now in Burlington Library Branch replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| You know, hopefully Walgreens will very soon announce that they're coming to this part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| The folks there certainly is equally deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| People in that part of town get the sniffles just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1739)|

| 0:29:13| You know, I, too, have concerns when I see things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| I'm glad to see the expansion of Walgreens and the walk-in clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| But, once again, I'm seeing an example where East Knoxville, once again, is being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| and my district is once again being overlooked by either an expansion or an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| You know, we have Knowledge, now we have Walgreens, we have possibly AT&T, and all these are concerning me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=1769)|

| 0:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Well, talk to him about it, and if there's something he thinks is beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| maybe we need to visit to make sure that if there's something that's helpful with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| and it's charging his duties for us that we can maybe add him in somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| And if it calls for another license expenditure, I'm sure that the mayor will cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement between the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| and Concessions and Catering by Cox for the provision of food, beverage, and catering services for Chilhowee Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| and Exposition Center for a period of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Councilman Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| I see Bob Polk is here with his entire entourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| I don't know if he wants to say anything or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| While he's coming forward, I've got to say that they put out some pretty good food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| Bob, anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I just would like to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| I'd like to recognize Janice McClellan, Assistant Purchasing Agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| She did an outstanding job with both these companies in the negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| and she should be recognized, I think, for her efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| She's sitting right behind me, and she's a tremendous addition to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| and is a pleasure to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| So noted, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| 11K is a resolution approving an agreement with Ovation's Food Services LP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| for food, beverage, and related concession services for the Knoxville Civic Coliseum Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Something I had discussed with Mr. Polk when they came up on our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| for the beer board getting their permit approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| I'm going to support this, but I've experienced Ovation's before over at the Nashville Super Speedway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| I have season tickets to go to the races over there, and just most recently at an IndyCar race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| And Ovation's has taken over the concessions at this track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| and this is the second year that they've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Quite frankly, I've been disappointed with the quality of the food and the prices, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| have gotten a little out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| You know, recalling from memory, it was like $5 for some chips and cheese, $4 for a bottled soft drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2146)|
| 0:35:55| $6 or $7 for a hot dog, and $9 for a beer, 48-ounce beer, but still $9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| So I've got some concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| We have some concerns about you having a 48-ounce beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| I hear your drinking problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| And, you know, last year I actually talked to management over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| and I know folks from Ovation's are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| and I don't know if they're the ones who handle the Nashville Super Speedway contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| but the person in management at the racetrack told me this was one of their largest areas of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| was the food service there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| And I know Ovation's is going to spend some money at the auditorium, coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| bring in some new equipment and do some new things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| But I do have legitimate concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| You know, I think I recall maybe an $8 or $9 barbecue sandwich that when you try to bring your family to an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2206)|
| 0:36:54| or it's just, you know, you and your boyfriend, girlfriend, or wife, husband, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| it becomes a very expensive evening for the people who are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| So I just want to say that this is something that really is a price sensitive situation for a lot of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| and tight economic times and that it should be carefully monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Bobby, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| In our situation, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Pricing, you know, is subject to approval of the director and the general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| Charles Lawrence, vice president of Ovation's from Tampa, Florida, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| He may want to address that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| My name is Charles Lawrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| I'm a vice president of business development for Ovation's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| And, Councilman Frost, I appreciate your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| I will tell you that the pricing is set in each venue that we serve by the directors of the venue or the ownership group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| And the pricing in Nashville, for instance, is set by ownership of the Speedway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| And we don't increase prices without approval of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| But what I certainly want to know is, and it's something that I can have a direct conversation with you in private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| is what your experience is because it's extremely important to us that our fans and our guests walk away with a good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2290)|
| 0:38:20| We have excellent plans for the Civic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| We're bringing freshness to the concession stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| And we are putting a sizable investment in to make improvements that will bring the food to another level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| But when it comes to pricing, the director of the facility will, of course, have final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| And our plan at the Civic Center is to offer more variety but keep the staple items in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| which will mean that the pricing for those staple items will remain consistent with where they've been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| I mean, I appreciate the proposal for a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| Bob can certainly pass my number on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| We don't need to take up the time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| But issues that I've experienced with quality and speed and serving people, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Can I just make a quick comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| I wanted to thank Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| This week we had the horse show at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| It was quite an experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| And Dale Dunn, the general manager, put in his usual 70-hour week working with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| But a number of the other city departments jumped in and helped us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| It was a little bit of a different experience for us and also the promoter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| But Councilman Bailey was helping us and we appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Mayor, since he brought it up, I just want to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| I encouraged a lot of my fellow council members and mayor and members of the administration to go over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| because this equestrian competition showed up in town and nobody really knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| And it was a big, big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| So I encouraged as many people as I could to go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| But I just want to say I watched Dale and Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| and really the whole city jump in there and work with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| And I believe they're coming back in a couple of weeks to talk about coming back again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| And I think with the appropriate marketing and public relations, it will be a big deal, an even bigger deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| And as a lot of us have been proponents of economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| that's a good way to fund our services and keep our tax base low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| So I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And I see Dale back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| But they did a phenomenal job and it was a huge operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| You know, I'd second that because I didn't know anything about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| until the day before we were leaving town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And I was so disappointed not to get to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| because I thought this is something that we don't see in Knoxville often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| And so it was a new opportunity to bring people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| And I'm sure a lot of people saw the photographs and heard about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| and wished they had had, you know, more information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| So I would look forward to trying to help you promote that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| and bring those folks back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I'd like to welcome Councilman Hall, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| He attends a lot of our events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| particularly at Chile-Hyde Park, the motorsports events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| So we're glad to see him back, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| He's coming to Nine Inch Nails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| That was a motion, not a Councilman Hall going to Nine Inch Nails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| He thinks it's a construction trade show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Keep moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Nine Inch Nails is a resolution supplementing Resolution No. 1644| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| adopted by the City Council of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| on January 4, 1949,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| entitled, A Resolution Providing for the Issuance of Electric Revenue Bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| so as to Provide for the Issuance of, Not to Exceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| $40 Million of Electric System Revenue Bonds, Series Y, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| Getting nervous about those numbers, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| These are great ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Excuse me, Councilman Hawkles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2521)|

| 0:42:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| This is just, in general, about the wastewater revenue bonds and PACE 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| with that much being borrowed and $75 million for wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| Where does that put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| I know you can't say exactly, but just any idea where that puts us in terms of total investment versus anticipated additional bond issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2549)|
| 0:42:39| where we are so far in terms of funding PACE 10, where we will still have to go, additional bond issues, et cetera, to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| We are about five years into the PACE 10 program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| It actually started in late 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| We actually go through the end of June 2016, so it's more than actually 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| We will probably issue about $430 million in total debt to help fund that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| And with this $75 million bond issue, that will put us right at $300 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| So the largest bond issues have occurred on the front end where a majority of the capital spending has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| and that will level off and decrease over the next five to six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=2606)|

| 0:50:00| Public forum, we have Ms. Nora Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Ms. Cooper, if you'd come down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| We're not in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| No, you signed up for public forum, so this is your chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| No, you're right where you should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Come on to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| And if you can, Steve, if you could pull that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| If you could start with giving us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| My name is Nora Cooper, and I live at 2720 Woodsmith Road, and my representative is Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3036)|
| 0:50:45| Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| And I was talking to him on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Little did I know that he was injured, and I felt so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| So I had to send him a get well card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| And I talked to his son for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| And I told him he needed to go into public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| You also have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| I should add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| My name, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I live, as I said, at 2720 Woodsmith Road across from Ridgedale Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3067)|
| 0:51:20| beyond Cumberland States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| And I'm an ex-school teacher and a graduate of UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| And I'm interested in the transportation, very much so, especially out in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3086)|
| 0:51:35| A lot of the, not a lot, but about two, three people from the cap board said I didn't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| And the lawyer told me I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| And that didn't make me feel too good because I've been paying city and county taxes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| about 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| So out in our area, all we have is Food City and the Pizza Hut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| And but the people of Knoxville, I think, wants the city of Knoxville to have an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| And so how do we make this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Like all the other things that you make happen, you've got a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3129)|
| 0:52:18| There are many options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| The city, the county, the people of Knoxville, the corporations, the private sector, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| state, the senators, and the Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| We don't need to cut services with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| We need to expand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| And transportation is part of our infrastructure, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| And how does all these decisions affect me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| I'm disabled physically in an electric wheelchair and emotionally I'm manic-depressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| But it's controlled by medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| And so I would, I don't consider myself in a different category, but you were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| about bringing the people together, differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| And it was so sad at the cap board meeting how the people were just begging to keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| lift service, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| It's been a blessing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| It's my only sole, it's my only transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| And I've called, I've gotten in contact with all of the, most of them, the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| the elected county commissioners, Stephanie from the ADA, and the Disability Advocacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| Law Center from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| And I would like to thank Chris Woodall and all the members of the CAT board for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| input into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| And lastly, I was wanting to ask the mayor something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| I'm totally dense on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| On the CAT board, I know there's some statutes already in place that you have to go by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| but is North Knoxville, South Knoxville, and East Knoxville represented on the CAT board, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| I think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| I can't remember exactly where everybody lives, but I'm pretty sure we do have a good geographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| balance on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Well, the reason why is because on the board, none of them didn't know where I lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| And they questioned if I lived even in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| When Mr. Longhorn, the lawyer, tells me I don't live in the city and I've been paying city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| and county taxes for 31 years, I feel like I'm out here by myself, you know, because there's people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3264)|
| 0:54:34| on that board that are voting that don't even know where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| Now, the chairperson is from Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| And I'm thinking in my mind, the CAT board is in the city, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| I mean, does the board, I mean, the statutes that are there, are they representing the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3289)|
| 0:55:00| Just the public forum is not supposed to be a question and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| But I'll just answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| I don't know what your rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| He has a downtown business and represents downtown business interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Lunchbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| I'm not going to question you on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| You have to keep me straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| But anyway, I just want you to make sure that the public wants to know that we still live out in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3315)|
| 0:55:27| and CAT provides excellent service for us in north Knoxville, west Knoxville, south Knoxville, and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3327)|
| 0:55:37| But I want all of you to look into the matter of transportation for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| We've already got a good transportation system and we need to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| It's part of our infrastructure and every city, practically in the United States, has a good transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3348)|
| 0:55:57| I don't think that we need any cuts in the Lyft service especially because, like with me, I would just be out there in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3357)|
| 0:56:06| I have no family support and CAT Lyft has been like almost like a ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| And Chris Woodall, I thank him and all the people of the board, how much input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| We had a real lively session the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| So I just want you to consider the transportation in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| And, again, this isn't a time for giving time out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| I will say that this council administration, that the CAT budget has increased far more than any other area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| since we've all been voting and approving on budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| and the budget's probably up 60 percent since this group came into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| Unfortunately, we have a budget that, as it stands now, is not in balance with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| So we still have some work to do to try to maintain service, but also, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| whether we're talking about more sidewalks or more pay for employees or, you know, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| there's a huge competition for more dollars and we don't just have a drawer full of money to pull out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| So we're going to still have to wrestle with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Councilman Hawthorne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| I appreciate very much Ms. Cooper's remarks and I appreciate your response, too, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| It's a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| She had mentioned Councilman Woodhull, of course, serves on the KTA board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And since he's not here tonight, first of all, I want to apologize to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| and to Councilman Woodhull in his absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| He had asked me to explain to I think council members know, the public may not know, that he's on vacation this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| He just asked me and I told him I would and I neglected to do that at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| But I know he's very concerned, as are all members of the KTA board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| and all the members of council about the issues that you've brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| I just wanted to say at the last statement that there's a lot of options out there where we can get the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| from the county, the city, the corporate, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Thank you very much, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080729?start=3490)|
