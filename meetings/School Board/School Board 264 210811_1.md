| 1:59:27| from this disease too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| I do not diminish this disease and the severity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| I need to make that clear because my family lost a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| grandfather, a father-in-law, a stepdad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| an uncle, all to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| But the mental toll on my kids was clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| after nine months of being in a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| I'm sure if we look at the test scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| they were well below what the state would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| liked for them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| Their will to learn declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| Their joy of school or going to school declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| But their anxiety soared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| How will my kindergartner who starts school in two weeks learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| how to read and enunciate her words properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| if the teacher cannot see her mouth moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| How will she connect socially to her teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| and her classmates in a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| Explain this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| How do I make my children understand if you can unmask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| at sporting events, lunch, recess, but not in a setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| where you are being educated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| How can I explain to her where the board can sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| up here unmasked together tonight, not six feet apart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| They also cannot comprehend at this age what anxiety is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| It's an emotion they don't know how to express yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| Unlike myself that can verbalize how the mask affects me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| So in return, their behavior changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| Their ability to understand the curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| in schools is difficult because guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| They're distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| I never thought my child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| and myself would experience panic attacks together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| Along with some of her peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| Now, remind you, she's nine years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| It isn't funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| The fact that the mocking is happening tonight is a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| To our community in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| The increase in antidepressant drug use speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| School is a place to socialize, play, learn, have fun experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| to make your child grow and thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| But masking our kids or making them be masked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| and COVID-19 has robbed our kids of this joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| Their first day of school was Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| And the joy and normalcy radiating in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| and in my community was awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| I was so excited and that's why I stand here today to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| for my kids and my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| I'm asking you to let us, the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| decide what is best for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| Unless you or Knox County is going to provide N95s for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| my kids, the proven mask that works, then this is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| Just like you all have chosen, I already said that, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| I was going to call you out on not wearing a mask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| Let that slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| I've got my notes all mixed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| Again, it should be parents' choice to mask our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| Please make masks an option for me and other parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| I just have a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Since this motion was added late to the agenda, is there a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| to suspend policy B180 to allow anyone else on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| to speak in case they want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| You can make a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| I would like to make a motion to suspend policy B180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| Okay. We have a motion by Ms. Henderson and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| by Ms. Christie, and that policy is the public forum policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Okay. So do we have discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| Your lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Do you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| Okay. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| I guess I'm a little, just explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| to me what she's talking about, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7415)|
| 2:03:35| Since Mr. Watson put the motion for late on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| I just want to make sure if there's anybody else who wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| to speak in regards to his new motion that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| that opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| So I think your point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| that the original agenda item was discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| and possible action regarding the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| and superintendent's authority concerning the implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| of public health protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| So this is a very different motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| than what was on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| Thank you for the question, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| Okay. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| Okay. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Okay. We have two opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| Okay. So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| Okay. So can I make a motion that we take a break before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7467)|
| 2:04:35| I already had this in my mind before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| that we take a break before discussion, before our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| with the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| that board members will not discuss Mr. Watson's motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| during the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| Okay. So, now, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| Okay. So do we have anybody that would like to second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| Okay. So we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| So any discussion on taking a break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| with no discussion during the break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| Okay. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| So if you're needing to speak, please come forward now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| and I will take further names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| So we will, we will meet back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Let's try to meet back at 7.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| So that's literally a six-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| Okay. 7.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| Okay. We're going to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| with a few more public forum folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| Since we are doing this as an addition, we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| to do a limitation of three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| for all speakers just to let people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| But we are happy to hear from everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| I'm going to start with Tina Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| And if you'll state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| Hello. My name is Tina Shields, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| My daughter was the one who spoke earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| I wanted to actually talk to you about contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| I have an 18-year-old special needs student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| with Down syndrome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| First semester last year, he was contact traced three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| And halls shut down for a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| and then the whole school shut down for a week at Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| So he missed eight weeks out of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| The weeks that he was home, he did nothing, literally nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| His PE class met and they did a little bit of stretching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| And other than that, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| He had three classes that opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| He had work sent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| He doesn't know how to use a mouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| He doesn't know how to find on a screen where he's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| to click to make something work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| He doesn't know how to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| So if it didn't have a recording that he couldn't find how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| to click on anyway, he's just sitting there staring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| at a screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| He had paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| But we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7625)|
| 2:07:05| I wasn't able to work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| So he got to the point that he literally, if he had to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| by the office, he was hugging the wall and looking away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| from the office because he was afraid to go near it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| because they were going to contact trace him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| Now, he has, he's a special needs student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| He has legal rights to his education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| and those were not met last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| I don't like to go down those kind of routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| But if I was to choose to, I mean, that is a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| I just want my child to be educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| I want him to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| He is living his best life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| And I see a lot of my friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| with special needs children asking, please get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| Please wear your mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| But what they don't understand is that by giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| up their freedoms and asking us to give up our freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| the more freedom we give, the less control we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| And at some point, we have no choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| And at that point, my child becomes disposable basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| They won't, he has no value to a society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| that doesn't value freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| He's not worthy of labor camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| And I'm sorry, that's where we're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| They're trying to take our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| And my child will be meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| So when we give up our freedom by making people wear masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7706)|
| 2:08:32| by making people get vaccinated, at some point, the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| that you're trying to protect, it won't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| because they're going to do what they want to with them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| Contact tracing needs to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| The kids that went home, they sat there and stared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| at the walls for two weeks and then went back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| Very, very few of them ever got sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| And that we know the tests are faulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| Let our kids go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| Let them see each other smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| Let them just socialize and be kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| They're resilient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| And I'm a special needs parent, and I want my kid unmasked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7749)|
| 2:09:09| Elizabeth Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7749)|
| 2:09:21| Please state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Elizabeth Wagner, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| I was not planning on speaking tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| because last year we were told over and over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7769)|
| 2:09:33| that the board did not want to discuss this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| I'm right there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| I don't want to discuss this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| I was honoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| I've sent very, very few emails because I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| that your time is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| Again, I was honoring your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| I've stated my case before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| However, it seems that we are once again discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| because we didn't have the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| that some people may have desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| Just to be clear, the students in my children's middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| and elementary school, I have four students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| They are stating that there are very few students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| that are masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| We spent last year in a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| My four children went with a mask, all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| We complied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| They hated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Daily we had headaches, stomachaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| tears about not wanting to go to school, issues making friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| in an environment where they can't see each other's faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| I picked up my students more times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| than I'm even comfortable with simply because they struggled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| so hard with wearing a medical device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| that restricts their airflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| Uniforms, they aren't medical devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| Medical devices should be a decision for parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| and their healthcare providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Your children might need insulin to stay alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| Mine doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| I'm going to decline any medical intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| that would harm my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| My child needs air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| She came home more times than not last year in tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| I'm talking about my eighth grader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| Mental issues are real in this pandemic and if you don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| that as an adult, I question if you're paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| One issue does not trump another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| I'm trying to protect my child from having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| to wear a medical device and you're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| to protect your child by wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| The difference is I'm not fighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| to take away your right to protect your child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| I don't want to take away your parental rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| to do what's best for your child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| Please respect my right to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| I would like to also add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| I don't believe this board has actually has the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| to instate a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Somebody brought up the governor but last time I checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| he's not an interpreter of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| We have an interpreter of the law that told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| that this board does not have the legal right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| to issue a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| I implore the board to move on from this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| I ask you to let us focus on educating our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| I ask you to continue to focus on the declining test scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| that our superintendent emailed about this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| I would like to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| on helping our smallest students learn how to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| I would like to see those students be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| to see the lips and facial expressions of their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| I would like to talk about how we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| to ease our children's anxiety from the fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| that we've instilled in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| I would like to focus on letting our children play instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| I would like to focus on the arts again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| I would like to let them be able to experience the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| that bring joy and life to their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| Please continue to let masks be a choice for our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7933)|
| 2:12:18| and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7939)|

| 2:12:39| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| I also wasn't prepared to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| So I'm here as the nurse practitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7962)|

| 2:12:48| COVID has significantly increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| I think yesterday alone, I did six cases of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| out of about 17, 18 patients for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| COVID is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| A year ago, when someone had COVID, we pretty much could tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| if you lost your sense of taste or smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Now people are coming in with what look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| like regular sinus infections with no loss of smell or taste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| And I'm testing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7992)|
| 2:13:12| They're coming up positive for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| We know that the tests are not 100% accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| But anytime we get a positive test, we must assume that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| and treat the person as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| The big thing is quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Stay home for those full 10 days or until you're feeling better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| Don't go out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| Don't do what so many people are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| and thinking a mask can protect you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| or a mask can protect your neighbor and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| out with active COVID into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| And that is but one of the problems with this masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| When it comes to children in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| my children are all graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| There is no way I would be sending my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| to school in a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| It is, it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| And I know that there are people that have been here that swear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| up and down it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| And they have the right to put on their face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| and constrict their child's breathing to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| that they feel is appropriate until we can prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| that they are causing child abuse to their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| But for those people who feel so adamant to force their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| to wear a mask, you have that right as that child's authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| And I respect that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| But I will tell you to please consider the profound mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| health conditions that you are potentially instilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| in your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8064)|
| 2:14:24| It is not healthy for a child to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| that they are a disease vector going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| around killing their grandparents and their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| It instills a very negative self-esteem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| It can set them up for lifelong fears of germs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| that cannot be undone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| without significant lifelong intensive therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| and medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| And I'm going to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| with something that's extremely unpopular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| It is okay for kids to get sick sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| It is okay for children to catch colds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| It is okay for children to go out and roll in the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| It is okay for children to make mud pies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| It is okay for children to build a healthy flora.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| We do know that antibiotics and over treating them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| with medications that they don't truly need can cause them bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| health problems than what they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| So for goodness sakes, let's treat COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| We've heard Dr. Child speak and state that up until now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| the majority of children who have had severe COVID are obese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| Okay, those of us in masks and those of us without masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| what are we doing to decrease the obesity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| I've had lifelong obesity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| I'm working on a diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| I'm never going to be thin, but I'm going to try and be thinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| But work on what helps get to a healthy weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8142)|
| 2:15:42| Sarah Wilson, please state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8142)|
| 2:15:50| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| Sarah Wilson, I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| As many of the others, I was not planning to speak to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| and I do much better when I like write down what I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| because I get flustered with public speaking, but I will attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| to try to get my point across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| A friend of mine is an elementary school teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| and she's watching, trying to watch the board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| She texted me as soon as she saw I was going to be able to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| and she said, if you speak, please speak on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| You can tell them I couldn't be there tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| because of Parent Info Night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| I cannot do my job in a mask, nor can a student learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| to produce sounds and words in a mask, much less pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| up on social cues, et cetera, which is so imperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| in the elementary school age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| So that is from one of your teachers in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| who is basically begging for you not to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| Also, I sent you guys an email a couple of days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8202)|
| 2:16:49| I'm just going to read some of that, and more so for our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| than for our board members because I'm hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| that you all do read your emails, and I know some of you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| So at the board meeting last week, one of the members went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| and forth with our law director asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| was it that he found that the board did not have authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| or did he not find anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| to support the board having authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| The school board receives its authority directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| from the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| The only authority the school board has is what the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| has expressly given them, nothing outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| The board does not have any authority unless it is given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| Your authority starts and ends with education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| The legislature has not given the board any authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| over health decisions for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| That choice lies with parents and them alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| Our law director, and I know Governor Lee came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| and said what he said as far as school boards having authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| but Governor Lee is not a law interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| We have a law interpreter, and he sat here last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| and I believe, I could be mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| but I believe there was another time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| where we've also had a lawyer come to you and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| this is not a route you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| It is not a legal route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| But Mr. Duke, or sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| our law director also last week referenced Dillon's rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| Dillon's rule is if there is a reasonable doubt whether a power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| has been conferred to a local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| then that power has not been conferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| If the government, if the legislature has not expressly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| given you that power, that power has not been conferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| So the problem with public officials that ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| like that is it comes across as if they're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| for power and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| And I have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| As a freedom-loving American, I have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| It is not your place in government to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| to control people and tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| It is your place as the board to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| that our kids get a quality education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| And I know for my kids, that did not happen last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| So I hope that we have a different outcome this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| Oh, also, as we were sitting here, the Tennessee House has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| called for a special session concerning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| So just thought you'd be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| Debra Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8339)|
| 2:19:10| Debra Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| Is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8352)|
| 2:19:12| Yes. Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| I also was not going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| I wasn't even going to be able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| But when I heard that things had been brought back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| I felt like it was my responsibility to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| and speak again, even if it's just to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| which way I wish y'all would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| So thank you for hearing from all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| including the ones after, because I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| that's an additional time that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| you didn't have to give, necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| It is good to air this all out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| although I know I think we all wish it would just be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| I forgot to say last week, I think some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| of y'all probably know I'm a mom of some Knox County students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| but I forgot to say that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| One of mine graduated this year, so she's going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| off to college, but I have another one who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| in high school, and this morning, because I happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| to be off today getting my daughter ready to go to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| I was able to take him to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| And it was so refreshing and wonderful to see all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| of those high school students interacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| like high school students should interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| The little ones need their interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| The high schoolers need their interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| I mean, my son is a sophomore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| For heaven's sake, his whole freshman year, he was in a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| He didn't know if some girl was smiling at him or not, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| I mean, that's not education, but that's part of them growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| up and learning how to interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| You know, I'm also a PA in the area, and the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| that people have been talking about today, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| someone came up and did say the PCR tests are faulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| They're going to stop using them in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| I don't know why they're going to continue until then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| but if you have a faulty test, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| the cycle threshold's too high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| all the false positives and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| In fact, you know, the crown prince of all of the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| that we have, Dr. Fauci, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| flip-flopped on masks multiple times on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| so how people don't see that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| You know that physical health consists of healthy habits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| healthy food, plenty of water, lots of rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| but the mental health, they need the interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| They need to be with other human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| They need to hug their friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| They need the facial cues so they can know how to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| and really know what someone is thinking or saying to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| You know, we've got to think about the whole kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| not just masks and one virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| So, please keep normalcy for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| They are so excited to be able to interact, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| like they should be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| We can't have them come to believe that being apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| from their friends, six feet, you know, distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| isolation, quarantining when you're not even sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| and masks are normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| That's not sustainable and it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| Alistair Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8516)|
| 2:22:03| Please state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| Alistair Elliott from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| Same as everybody else, threw this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| One thing I heard earlier tonight is talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| about the kids who are dying from COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| having underlying issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| Since when is the school district just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| for healthy kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| We have lots of sick kids in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| with underlying conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8547)|
| 2:22:28| Do we not care about them at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| What about their family members of the kids who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| like the healthy kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| Because they probably have aunts, uncles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| grandparents who have health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| We don't care about any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| My brother at 14 was diagnosed with a heart condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8562)|
| 2:22:46| Nobody knew he had it until he got pneumonia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| and ended up in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| He lived, but COVID is worse than pneumonia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| How many kids are in the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| that may have a health condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| that the parents don't even know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| and they think they're healthy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| Somebody else mentioned car accidents and how they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| like more of a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| Well, yeah, well, we have laws requiring seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| We have laws requiring that we have lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| that work on our cars so that, because it's regarding safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| We have regulations on the auto industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| to make sure the safest cars are on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| and that we're not putting unsafe cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| to put people at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| We have laws all over the place to help keep us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| This, we're not even talking about a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| We're just talking about the school district putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| in a mandate for masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| The doctor who talked earlier is functional medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| That's pseudoscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| He introduced himself as doctor because he, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| I guess he'd make people think he was an expert on the topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| but as a previous speaker said, like percussionist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| acupuncture, whatever he does, is not viral medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| He does not know about viral medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| if he's doing functional medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| It's, they're two completely different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| He's not an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| All of this other stuff we're hearing, it's melodrama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| And personally, I'm cool with theatrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| Like, I have fun with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| You guys have seen me up here as a satanic minister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| There's a time and a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| And when it comes to the safety of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| it's not the time or the place for melodrama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| Like, kids need air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Come on. We've been walking around with masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| for a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| And, I mean, me and my friends, we're still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| How many kids in the school district died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| because they didn't have oxygen last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| Anybody? One single kid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| Because all our kids were wearing masks in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| they all survived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| They're all doing just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| They all got their air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| Like, lifelong fear of illnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| Come on. We've had illnesses all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| We take precautions against different kind of illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| It's not going to create a lifelong fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| It's melodrama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Like, end result here, if one single child dies this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| because they contracted COVID in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| it's on your hands if you don't put a mask mandate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| That's probably why you don't want contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| so you can have, like, a guilt-free conscience there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8711)|
| 2:25:23| Please state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| There are actual studies that prove masking works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| I would love to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| I have seen data that proves masking does not prevent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| spread of any virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| There's 40 years of studies that have proven that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| Please provide that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| We even heard tonight from a data analyst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| who provided zero data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| As a nurse, I know how to prevent the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| of contaminants from patient to patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| When you wear a mask in a healthcare setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| you put your mask on, you do what needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| with that patient, then you remove it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| put it in a biohazard containment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| and then wash your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| Then you don another mask to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| of your next patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| And then it's been proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| that hand washing prevents the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| of contaminants such as COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| If you're wearing a mask and you touch it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| you've contaminated yourself, possibly with COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| you need to wash your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| But children and teachers have been wearing the same masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| for hours, touching it, touching surfaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| spreading viruses everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| So if you can provide me with a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| that proves beyond a doubt, then please get it to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| because after 18 months of searching, I have yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| to find one that is not opinion-based or supposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| And I must remind you that masks are not articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8802)|
| 2:26:44| of clothing as has been stated before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| when they were talking about uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| Per the FDA, they are medical devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| I'm going to end with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| I just received information and I think one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| of the other ladies just touched on it a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| I'm going to repeat what Speaker Cameron Sexton said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| Parents should make and be in charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| of their children's healthcare decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| Unelected bureaucrats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| and local entities taking away parental choice destroys their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| freedom and liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| We need to stand with our parents and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| I'll be calling a special session in the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| to discuss parents' rights to make healthcare decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| for their children versus the government's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| to mandate them, preserving our freedoms and liberties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| stopping unelected bureaucrats and unelected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| from making health decisions involving children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| and businesses, protecting Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| from COVID-related discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| ensuring educators are appropriately compensated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| for COVID leave, and additional COVID-related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| Okay. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8873)|
| 2:27:54| I can't read the first name of this, but it's Miss Harley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| or Harley is the last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| Sorry. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8878)|
| 2:28:04| If you can just say your first and last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| It's Wendy Harley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| Wendy. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| That was a tricky one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| I'm not laughing about your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| I just could not read it, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8895)|
| 2:28:15| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| So I bought into the mainstream news, hook, line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8896)|
| 2:28:22| and seeker from the Italy stories, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| let my anxiety get built up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| I'm a registered nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| I thought, oh, I need to be paying attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| to what mainstream media is showing me and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| Well, obviously, I forgot all logic and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| that I've learned in my nursing career, and part of that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| because I was mourning a brother that I was losing to cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| who didn't get his last treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| Now, that doesn't have a lot to do with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| and our children and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| but everybody's being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| Now, what's interesting is I listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| to doctors who have been censored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| You've got to ask yourselves, why are they being censored?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| Maybe they have something good to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| Maybe they're speaking truth, and the majority doesn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| to hear it presently, and another good rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| is if you look at what the science, what CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| and all this was saying before the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| it was that masks don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| These viruses are super tiny, and if you look around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| oh, my gosh, she took it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| A virus just went in that mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| Another one went up her nostril.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| When they go into the restaurant, did you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| that the COVID particles hover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| They don't go down when you're sitting, and let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| There's just all kinds of ridiculous things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8978)|
| 2:29:42| but once I started searching for the truth, I was able to find it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| and the thing is, I'm high risk, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| These children's that are special needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| yes, they're high risk, but guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| There are safe, proven over 65 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=8994)|
| 2:30:00| of treatments that are cheap, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| It doesn't include a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| It's called hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| if you have long hauler symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| If you're lucky enough to deal with that, then you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| to find a doctor that will prescribe you that, and you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| to find an independent pharmacy that's not controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| by big tech, and I would say, you know, it's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| that we're putting a lot of stock barrel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| into our school board, but guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Our U.S. civil rights are protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| and I have a religious belief that I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| to breathe through my mouth, and so for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| I will never put on a mask, and I will be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| by federal law 28 CFR 36.202, which prohibits anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9039)|
| 2:30:47| from allowing me to enter based on their mandate because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9047)|
| 2:30:54| I lost my train of thought, because they believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9054)|
| 2:31:00| that I need to be wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| If they're that afraid, they need to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| Thank you, Erin McNeil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9066)|
| 2:31:20| State your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Erin McNeil, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| So, I am also a nurse practitioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| and I had a grandmother that died from COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| but I just, I wasn't prepared to talk tonight, and I jotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9095)|
| 2:31:43| down some things that I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| There's a peer-reviewed journal article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| that I found this week called Imperfect Vaccination Can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| There's also a study in Israel that studied natural immunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| and found that natural immunity is far superior to vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| Other thought I was having is this, COVID's never going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| to go away because there is an animal reservoir for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| Even if everybody is, there's herd immunity, there's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| going to be an animal reservoir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9141)|
| 2:32:22| so it'll be passed on just like the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| The other thing is PCR tests don't differentiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| between the Delta variant and a regular COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| I wasn't sure about that myself, so I called several places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| to see if they could check, just to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| if I had the Delta variant, and they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| Another thing is that the CDC, they're not reflecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| in their numbers people that have COVID that were vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| Those numbers aren't available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| And then there's a lot of information on the VAERS reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| and CDC about the COVID vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| And another thing is vaccines are not FDA approved yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| so they're essentially experimental treatments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| And with experimental treatments, you need informed consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| and they should never be done on vulnerable populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| I mean, it has no long-term studies yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| So I would, you know, be really concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| about vaccinating children until you research yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| I would look at the VAERS reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9207)|
| 2:33:28| There's been cases of myocarditis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| The former Pfizer chief recently stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| that children are 50 times more likely to die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9213)|
| 2:33:36| from the vaccine than COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| I would pay attention to your confirmation bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| We have a history in this country of practicing science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| things that's not the name of science, based on experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| like mandatory sterilization, electroconvulsive therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| chemical restraints on people with mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| And so that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| That's all I could think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9241)|

| 2:34:07| Sorry if I mispronounced your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9247)|
| 2:34:14| And please state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| Hi, I'm Jennifer Stambaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| First of all, I wanted to clarify I'm publisher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| of Hard Knocks Wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| You've seen me running around taking pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| and doing stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| I am not here as publisher of Hard Knocks Wire right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| Name badge is going off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| I am here as a educator with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| and as a parent of a student in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| First of all, anyone talking about learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| that's not an educational term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| That is a political propaganda term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Educators did not create learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| That is a political term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| I teach at Ridgedale with special education students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| My kids learned last year despite pandemic precautions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| despite wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| My nonverbal special needs students learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| and if anything, made more progress last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| than any other year because we did research on what needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| to be done, and we implemented new technology and made changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9317)|
| 2:35:22| and did what was right for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| They learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Secondly, lives are more important than learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9325)|
| 2:35:31| If we kill off all of our kids, education doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| We can't teach to a classroom of dead kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| I've been to student funerals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| People talk about the trauma of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| and the emotional toll of all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| There is nothing more traumatizing than going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| to a funeral of a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| Nothing. My kid caught COVID last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9355)|
| 2:36:01| She is a long hauler now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| I'm taking her to Vanderbilt Hospital next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| Anyone who doesn't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| that kids don't suffer long-term consequences from this is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| than welcome to pick up my medical bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| or hold my crying child at night and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| over my responsibilities on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| Please, I'd love to have that burden lifted off of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| and I don't appreciate people who negate that as a myth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9383)|
| 2:36:29| The science is clear when you look at real science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9389)|
| 2:36:34| Real science is published in peer-reviewed publications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9394)|
| 2:36:39| It is not published on YouTube or Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| When you look at the real science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| vaccines have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| Masks have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| They're not 100%, but they do significantly improve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| outcomes of this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| Our hospitals are filling up right now, including children's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| and that was before our kids came back this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| With kids coming back in the classrooms, we need to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| in precautions to keep our children safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| and not have any more kids have the long-term consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| of COVID that my daughter is currently suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| Tanya Camby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9446)|
| 2:37:49| Is it Tanya Camby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| If you'll just state your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9470)|
| 2:38:01| speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| My name is Tanya Campery, I'm Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| I am saying before you guys tonight, I am not a doctor, I am not a nurse, I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| to claim to know any of the medical things that have been shared tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| I'm here to share my truth with you guys and my experience, and I'm asking that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9497)|
| 2:38:24| guys respectfully consider it as you vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| Some of you guys may know me, I've served on various boards over the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9510)|
| 2:38:36| on local, on county, and on state levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| I am going to make it very clear right now, I am not here representing any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| I am a Knox County school sub, I subbed the majority of last school year, nearly every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| month I maxed out on my sub days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| I'm not here as a Knox County school sub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| I am here as a parent of three children in Knox County schools, and I think unless I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| missed it tonight, I'm also here as the only one that I'm aware of as someone who is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9542)|
| 2:39:11| fighting something called PASC, it's commonly known as Long COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9551)|
| 2:39:19| I had COVID pneumonia in April, I subbed up until I got sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9559)|
| 2:39:25| Once I got sick, I was out for the rest of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| I was in a hospital twice, I've been diagnosed with multiple, and many of you in here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9568)|
| 2:39:34| know me and know my journey, multiple life-threatening illnesses as a consequence of COVID, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9574)|
| 2:39:44| several heart conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| So what I'm going to say to you guys tonight, I am not taking it lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9586)|
| 2:39:52| I've gone as far as researching medical documents outside of the United States because I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| so over the political stuff that has come with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9598)|
| 2:40:07| I am not asking you guys to put masks on our babies in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9607)|
| 2:40:13| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9613)|
| 2:40:14| I'm going to tell you why, as I mentioned, I subbed mostly in elementary school over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9614)|
| 2:40:22| the past years, and while we could debate until tomorrow the effectiveness of the mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9622)|
| 2:40:30| I'm going to tell you guys something that I learned that the kids thought that the masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| were great for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| They chewed on them, they shared them with each other, because Buzz Lightyear is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| cool, but so is Mickey Mouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| And so they would share them, they'd use them as slingshots, put paper balls in there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| sling them across the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| I don't think they're as effective as we hope that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| I can share with you what my doctors say, it's split down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| As many tell me to wear a mask, the others don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| So I'm just asking you guys, like I said, to consider what I've told you as you vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9668)|

| 2:41:23| I have three children in Knox County schools, all too young to be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| We did virtual last year, which was not a bad experience, and the kids have been so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| excited to be back in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| They have loved their three days of school, they've happily worn masks to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| One of them is high risk, so we try to do what we can to keep the germs away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9700)|
| 2:41:46| They've not had any problems going through their routine with masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| I think we can all agree tonight that what we want is to keep schools open, and to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| those kids in school, and to keep them healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| At this point, COVID is not a regular virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| It is harmful and new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| Hopefully we won't have to deal with this forever, because it will mutate to be less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| dangerous, but we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| We are all tired of this, but it is our responsibility to protect our children as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9729)|
| 2:42:14| The experts say to do this, we need universal masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| That means everybody needs to be wearing a mask in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| It's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| The kids touch things, they pull their mask down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| It doesn't always work, but that is what has helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| And your kid wearing a mask helps protect my kid wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9748)|
| 2:42:33| Even if there's a minor chance that wearing a mask can help our children, why would we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| not do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| Why would we not encourage it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| I've seen friends suffer from this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| I want to do my part to decrease the suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| Sitting here and doing nothing is harmful and a bad example to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9764)|
| 2:42:49| We elect officials to govern us when we cannot agree on a solution to a problem, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9769)|
| 2:42:54| we can see tonight that we can agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| COVID is a problem that's getting worse, and what we're doing now is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| It's not slowing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| We need to put these mandates back in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| I hope you'll listen to the experts and follow their advice and their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| All over the world, people are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| It's not just our country and our politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| It's our responsibility to have compassion for our community and to show our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| that we care for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9802)|

| 2:43:30| Please state your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| My name is Hannah Kirby, and I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Thank you to Ms. Henderson for making the motion to allow everybody who feels so strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| about this issue to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| Rather than get into the beliefs on masking that I hold, I do want to say that I respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9825)|
| 2:43:52| each and every one of you for the service that you do for our county as elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9832)|
| 2:43:58| You all know that I have great respect for elected office, and that I want to see you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9838)|
| 2:44:04| all live up to the full potential of a board of education, and that is why I want to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| here tonight with a very clear understanding of the future direction of Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9850)|
| 2:44:16| when it comes to COVID-19 protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9856)|
| 2:44:19| I think that in April, at that last, I think it was the 14th meeting, everybody left with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9859)|
| 2:44:25| an idea of what would happen if the CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9865)|
| 2:44:31| their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| When that happened, I think that a few people, more than a few, were surprised that Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9872)|
| 2:44:37| County schools was not changing direction with them, and that's at the crux of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| If tonight you all decide that you no longer want to follow through with that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| from April, then that's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| I don't think that any of you are going to have your minds changed on masks or social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9890)|
| 2:44:54| distancing tonight, because you've been listening to a lot of us and our opinions for months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9894)|
| 2:45:00| and months, and you have your sources and your experts that you hold in the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9905)|
| 2:45:06| But I do think that consistency and following through on your word is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9906)|
| 2:45:13| and if you do change your minds, then it needs to be a vote, and it needs to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9913)|
| 2:45:19| Everybody, lots of people on both sides have asked for that clear communication going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| and if you do decide to change your minds, then clear communication to the families who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| would have made a different decision regarding virtual versus in person is also important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9928)|
| 2:45:35| I know that you all have spent a lot of time listening to us speak, reading emails and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9935)|
| 2:45:45| doing your own research, and I commend you for the hours that you've put into it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| I just hope that going forward, you all do uphold the integrity of the Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| of Education, vote on something, and then follow through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| Thank you, Ms. Hennessey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9969)|
| 2:46:10| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| Was Mr. Watson's light on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| Go ahead, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9972)|
| 2:46:13| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to all the speakers that came out and shared with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9973)|
| 2:46:22| us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| First, I want to acknowledge that even with all the incredible energy this week with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| coming back in full force, including we know that there's at least one family in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| with a very heavy heart this week with the senseless death of their son, John John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| I can't imagine the pain that they're feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| I don't want to detract from that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| My intention is not to also detract from the start of the new school year, but it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10002)|
| 2:46:46| given the meeting last week and the changing landscape as it relates to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| Again, thank you all to our public forum speakers that shared tonight and who have been sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| with us via email and many times in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| As you all know, you know that I've stated many times throughout the last nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| this is not a conversation that I wanted to keep having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| And I know that I brought it up this time, but I fundamentally brought it up because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| the understanding that I had in April evidently was not what the board approved, according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| Over the last year, all of us have heard a wide range of concerns that relates to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| We have heard from families who have lost loved ones due to COVID, folks who have experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| social and emotional trauma due to the impacts of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| Families have been upended economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10048)|
| 2:47:30| Many students have experienced an ever-widening gap in learning and so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10050)|
| 2:47:34| In fact, I would be shocked if not all of us in this room has experienced some loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10054)|
| 2:47:40| to some degree due to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| Pandemics are extremely effective at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| They are destructive and they're painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10065)|
| 2:47:48| For the 2021 school year, KCS, under Superintendent Thomas's leadership and the board, consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10068)|
| 2:47:55| said we will follow the recommendations of our public health leaders, including CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| the Tennessee Department of Health, and the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| At no point during the last school year did any outside entity, not the governor, mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10082)|
| 2:48:06| Tennessee Department of Health, CDC, president, et cetera, mandate that Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| follow COVID protocols, including masks, with the exception of masks wearing on buses as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| mandated by the federal government at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| Everything KCS did in response to COVID was due to Superintendent Thomas's and the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10103)|
| 2:48:24| We have made our own local decisions and last year we consistently followed the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10104)|
| 2:48:29| of public health leaders, which was the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| This allowed us to have those kids who opted for in-person instruction in school for 93%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| of the school days last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| Superintendent Thomas has stated that many times and I completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| KCS has been able to accomplish something that many districts in our state were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| Over the last two weeks, there have been a lot of talk about the impact of COVID on students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| and the impact it had on learning in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| Everyone agrees that students should be in in-person instruction as it provides the greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| opportunity for students to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| I also agree, but my concern is the more we become lax regarding COVID, especially now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10144)|
| 2:49:10| the more we are going to see students out of school at best and at worst very sick and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| We also need to remember that students do not live in bubbles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| Dr. Lisa Piercy, the head of the Tennessee Department of Health, said in Tennessee, children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| are about 10% of all cases right now, whereas it was only about 2% at this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10163)|
| 2:49:29| With all due respect to Mr. Dupler and our law department, although the votes in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10169)|

| 2:49:48| The board was actively working to accomplish one thing, but it took two votes to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| The board was working to entrust the ongoing COVID response back to the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10193)|
| 2:49:57| to become more nimble in response to the COVID pandemic as the situation has and continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10197)|
| 2:50:02| to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10202)|
| 2:50:03| In order to do that, we had to sunset the policy regarding masks because the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| was not nimble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10207)|

| 2:50:19| the Tennessee Department of Health guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| During the April meeting, the board went to great lengths to ensure the wording of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| plan matched the guidelines at the time, including language around masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| In the plan, there was also language to ensure that the public, that KCS would pivot as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10228)|
| 2:50:33| guidance changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| This put the ongoing response back into the hands of the superintendent with the guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10234)|

| 2:50:39| It was clear that the plan was to be implemented after the mask policy sunset, regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10239)|
| 2:50:45| whether or not it sunset in August or the subsequent May date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10245)|

| 2:51:11| as outlined in the approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| Dr. Lisa Peercy also stated that the Tennessee Department of Health will not be issuing new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10274)|

| 2:51:44| I talked to him at great length last week and then I noticed he was also on the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10304)|
| 2:51:49| from East Tennessee Children's Hospital said he also thinks we, speaking of Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10309)|
| 2:51:53| in general, let our guard down and students should opt to wear a mask in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10313)|
| 2:51:59| I've stated many times I do not think we should make decisions regarding COVID-19 and KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| based on public opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| That being said, I've continued to track public opinion through emails I've received on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| Each time I've tracked it, the strong majority is in favor of implementing COVID protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| and KCS that align with the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| That includes the 395 emails I've received over the past week, 68% of which said to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10338)|
| 2:52:24| the guidelines and 32% said not to, or to leave it up to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| And I'm getting toward the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| Also, there are several petitions on change.org if you're interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| There's two current petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| One as of this morning had 1,839 signatures asking for KCS to follow COVID protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10356)|
| 2:52:43| And then there was another petition asking KCS to make masks optional, which had 1,114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10363)|
| 2:52:49| And then there were two older petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| There was one from April that had 155 signatures in the mask mandate and give a little shout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10370)|
| 2:52:56| out to Raymond Jen over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| He took initiative and he had a petition out in April last year in support of masks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10380)|
| 2:53:07| garnered over 2,000 signatures at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| He has since removed it because that was not the current issue, which I totally respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10390)|
| 2:53:14| that he did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10394)|
| 2:53:15| Finally, since the board began discussing this issue in October of last year, I consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| stated that I believe the board needs to choose whose guidance it is going to rely on regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10400)|
| 2:53:24| COVID-19 mitigation strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| And to empower the superintendent to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| That is what I and the majority of the board voted for back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| I know I voted this way because I knew the circumstances, and I believe others did, related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| to COVID would continue to fluctuate as it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| And the board didn't need to be discussing our response at every board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10420)|
| 2:53:45| With the sunset of the policy of C240, which I voted for again, I have not thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10425)|
| 2:53:49| the right way to continue to navigate COVID in the coming weeks and months is through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10429)|
| 2:53:53| policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| I still believe we need to empower the superintendent and his team to adjust expectations, protocol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| and requirements as the pandemic shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| That being said, it seems that under the guidance from the law department, that only the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10441)|
| 2:54:06| of Education can empower the superintendent to implement a layered response to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10446)|
| 2:54:11| including face coverings, which is why I offered the motion that I did tonight to authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10451)|
| 2:54:18| the director of schools to implement layered prevention strategies regarding COVID-19 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| align with the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control Prevention, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10462)|
| 2:54:26| but not limited to contact tracing, quarantine, physical distancing, adding additional cleaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10466)|
| 2:54:31| and universal masking for all students, teachers, staff and visitors while indoors, that guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| may change in several ways as the year progresses based on the community transmission rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10476)|

| 2:55:02| I think it's been said a picture is worth a thousand words or signatures or emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10502)|
| 2:55:13| and we've had all of those probably this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| For those of you that can't read it, this says the CDC currently recommends that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10516)|

| 2:55:51| The next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10551)|

| 2:56:05| Our family alone had seven people in attendance, in addition to the athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| Just conservatively, if you said every child had one parent there plus the 2,000 athletes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10570)|
| 2:56:18| that would be 3,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10578)|

| 2:57:12| Now why is this important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| Everyone could read the sign on the front when they went in that said the CDC currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10634)|
| 2:57:19| recommends that all people wear masks indoors regardless of vaccine status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10639)|
| 2:57:25| Because I believe these people are representative of the people of Knox County that want freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10645)|
| 2:57:32| of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| And is there one last one, Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10655)|
| 2:57:36| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10656)|
| 2:57:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10657)|
| 2:57:38| So I share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| Last year I shared a lot of examples of baseball fields, soccer fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10661)|
| 2:57:46| But as I sat there that day, 11 days out from starting school, actually just the next, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10666)|
| 2:57:53| was on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| Until Monday, school started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| And I looked at all these people and I thought, three masks, hmm, that's an interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| And the thing is, is we can mask at the schools, but we can't mandate masks for the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10683)|
| 2:58:12| 24-hour day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| And after school, this is what kids do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| They are in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| And the parents that want that freedom for their child to run on the soccer field and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| not have to breathe in and be able to breathe while they're running are choosing not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| So I would like to finish up because I had the privilege today of going to visit schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10712)|
| 2:58:38| with Superintendent Thomas and visited two schools in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10718)|
| 2:58:43| And I could count on my hand how many students were in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| Maybe two hands, no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| How many teachers and staff were in masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| I could count on one hand, maybe two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| So people are choosing, and you, the board, the public, we cannot make people give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10740)|
| 2:59:08| their freedom and mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| And it's not helping, in my opinion, to mask kids in school if they're going to the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10750)|
| 2:59:17| fields and the swim meets and living life outside of school unmasked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10757)|
| 2:59:22| So that's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| And as I said, the board has received thousands, probably, of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10766)|
| 2:59:31| That may be an over-exaggeration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| And we've seen the surveys and the thousands of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10774)|
| 2:59:39| And we've had a thousand words probably spoken over the course since April on masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10779)|
| 2:59:45| And yet, I think that all of this to say that people want their freedom and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10785)|
| 2:59:55| not in the business as an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| It was my position that we need to educate our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| So it comes down to two things for me, freedom and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10804)|
| 3:00:08| And I'm not a health expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| I have read all the emails and all the studies on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| And I can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| Thank you, Ms. Founts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10817)|
| 3:00:18| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10818)|
| 3:00:19| And I'll keep my comments short as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10819)|
| 3:00:26| And I agree with Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10826)|
| 3:00:27| I mean, and I look at those pictures and I guess what bothers me the most about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| is I keep thinking about the Halls golf team, you know, that couldn't play last year when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10832)|
| 3:00:41| really if we knew then what we know now, they could have played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10841)|
| 3:00:48| And a lot of things like that happened last year that I regret seeing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10848)|
| 3:00:54| And you know, and I think people on both sides agree because we hear from both sides that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| they are in the schools and no one's wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10860)|
| 3:01:06| Both sides have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| And I think that speaks volumes to what the parents want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| Parents want to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| And I've had many parents tell me that their kids aren't going to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| So then it comes down to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| How do you, are we going to expel 30,000 kids when they show up without a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10881)|
| 3:01:26| I mean, I just don't know that this is going to work when Dr. Buchanan herself said she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10886)|
| 3:01:34| can't issue a mask mandate because she knows the community is not going to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10894)|
| 3:01:40| You know, and if the community doesn't follow it, what makes us think that parents are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10900)|
| 3:01:44| to, you know, put the masks on their kids in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10904)|
| 3:01:51| And I don't have the answer to that, but I do think that, you know, the parents have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| made it clear that that's not something they're going to do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10914)|
| 3:02:01| I would like to see some, maybe clarity that concerns about people asking if students have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10921)|
| 3:02:11| been vaccinated, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| That bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10934)|
| 3:02:15| And I would like for us to address that as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| And the other thing is maybe, I know we have to report numbers to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10940)|
| 3:02:27| I do think we need to at least give parents something so they can do their own risk assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10947)|
| 3:02:32| You know, that they need to know if there's problems in their school or if there are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10952)|
| 3:02:40| lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10960)|
| 3:02:41| I mean, I would like to see us do some kind of reporting or go back to a dashboard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| some kind so that parents could at least see what's going on in their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10966)|
| 3:02:51| And I don't know if that's possible, but I do think we need to have something there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10971)|
| 3:02:57| help parents, you know, to assess their risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10977)|
| 3:03:01| And, you know, some might want to wear masks some days and not on others, depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| what they're seeing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| Mr. Chen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10992)|
| 3:03:13| So, I guess before I begin, I'd like to say two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| One, if I start stumbling over myself, my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| I don't have anything formally written down, so I'm just going off my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| Second thing is I have a feeling that regardless of what I say, the decision that this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11003)|
| 3:03:29| will make and however much time we will make that vote is more or less set in stone, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11009)|
| 3:03:36| I will still speak my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| So as a student representative, I would, of course, first like to give the student thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11022)|
| 3:03:43| Yes, there are a few students, there are very few students who are wearing masks in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11023)|
| 3:03:50| Obviously, it depends from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11030)|
| 3:03:51| My school, Berger High School, maybe 10%, maybe less, maybe a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11031)|
| 3:03:57| My little sister, she is in sixth grade, she goes to Berger Middle School, maybe less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11037)|
| 3:04:02| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11042)|
| 3:04:03| However, I also do know a lot of students who, although they may not be currently wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11043)|
| 3:04:08| a mask, they would gladly do so if a mandate were to be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| Additionally, I think, as with the public, the issue of mask mandates, no mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11052)|
| 3:04:19| I do actually think that the student opinion might be split closer to half and half and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| not as close to what we might see with the number of people actually wearing masks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| not wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| So that's how I think that's kind of the student perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| So either way, whatever the board decides today, you know, there will be a chunk of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| students who agree, there will be a chunk of students who do not agree, which the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| did the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| So I guess kind of moving into my own opinions on this topic, obviously the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| is concerned about the education students in this county, and that is what we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| ensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| We want to ensure that our students receive the education they need to fulfill their full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11092)|
| 3:04:57| potential in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| Now the issue with COVID-19 and masks is that, yes, I understand possibilities of especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11099)|
| 3:05:06| younger students, if you put a mask on them, they may not be able to learn as well because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| they can't see their teachers, can't see their words, their teachers don't know, can't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| them and not see their words, things like that might affect their learning, perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| mental health issues, stress, anxiety, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11118)|
| 3:05:21| I completely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| However, I'd also like to say that if students are getting sick, even if they do not die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11123)|
| 3:05:29| even if they do not have to go to the ICU or be hospitalized, that is still taking away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11129)|
| 3:05:36| from the opportunity to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11136)|
| 3:05:39| A lot of students are getting sick and we know that with this new Delta variant, COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| transmission rates are higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11143)|
| 3:05:44| We have the case data these past few days, 80, 70, 60, 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11144)|
| 3:05:50| We see the data that came out today, hospitalization rates are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11150)|
| 3:05:56| If more students are getting sick, even if they don't die or anything like that, I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11156)|
| 3:06:00| they don't, they will have a hard time learning because they will be missing school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11160)|
| 3:06:06| If we can influence safety precautions that ensure that our students can receive the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11166)|
| 3:06:10| that they need, then I think that would be in the best interest of those students, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| if they do not wish to wear a mask even if it is uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| As for mental health issues, I do sincerely hope that we have the resources necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11178)|
| 3:06:24| to help students through mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| I was completely virtual last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11187)|
| 3:06:28| I know many virtual students last year, at least, did have many mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11188)|
| 3:06:34| and had a very hard time learning online and it was just a very difficult time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11194)|
| 3:06:40| to be frank, some of them didn't have the resources they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| And I hope if, you know, if this board does vote to issue a mask mandate, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| that students will have some issues with that, stress, anxiety, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11208)|
| 3:06:52| I do hope that we have the resources in place for them to feel comfortable, for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11212)|
| 3:06:57| feel that they can learn to their highest potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11217)|
| 3:07:01| And so I guess kind of closing, I sincerely hope that this board seriously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11221)|
| 3:07:07| thinks about issuing a mask mandate for students to ensure that students can receive the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11227)|
| 3:07:11| they need, even if it might be uncomfortable, even if I know a lot of people will talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11231)|
| 3:07:17| freedom of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11237)|
| 3:07:18| Yes, obviously we have freedom, but the issue here is, is that your choice to mask your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11238)|
| 3:07:22| kid or not to mask your kid doesn't just affect your kid, it also affects other people's kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11242)|
| 3:07:27| And I think we can agree that we shouldn't have the ability to choose what happens to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| other people's kids, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| So, you know, I just want to say, you know, I sincerely hope the board seriously considers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| issuing a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11255)|
| 3:07:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11256)|
| 3:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11259)|
| 3:07:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11260)|
| 3:07:41| Just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11261)|
| 3:07:42| I was just sitting here thinking that I agree with Ms. Bounds and Ms. Christie over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11262)|
| 3:07:56| as to what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| But I also thought, went through my mind that a couple of weeks, we'll have high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11279)|
| 3:08:05| football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| And if you want to see people not masking and sitting close together in groups, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11287)|
| 3:08:16| know, I'm relatively sure that that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11296)|
| 3:08:22| So, you know, maybe it will, I don't know whether any benefit will come from it, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11302)|
| 3:08:30| know, or not as far as like immunity, but I'm relatively sure that it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11310)|
| 3:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11321)|
| 3:08:42| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| Thank you, Ms. Christie, for bringing up the point around data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11325)|
| 3:08:50| Mr. Thomas, can you speak to what we learned from the Department of Education this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11330)|
| 3:08:55| related to what we need to be reporting in terms of data with COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11335)|
| 3:09:00| As I understand, there will be a reporting requirement for the district to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11340)|
| 3:09:05| So I'm not seeing that template yet, but I know we're working on information to collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11345)|
| 3:09:10| the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| Do we know yet if that will be required to be reported at a district level or school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11351)|
| 3:09:14| level or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| If it's like last year, I believe it's district level and not school level, but I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11356)|
| 3:09:22| what, you know, what the requirement is going to be this year yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| So we should find out fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| So in order for us to report it at a district level, we'll probably have to receive it at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| a school level and then we'll roll it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11373)|
| 3:09:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11374)|
| 3:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11376)|
| 3:09:37| And I believe the Department of Ed also said that that would live on at least a state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11377)|
| 3:09:40| dashboard where parents can see that, but I, I do appreciate Ms. Christie's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11380)|
| 3:09:46| And I think there is some, some, some credence to making the decision, maybe locally for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11386)|
| 3:09:52| parents to be able to access that at a school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11392)|
| 3:09:55| So so they can see what's going on in their school and they can make decisions accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11395)|
| 3:10:01| Also I wanted to, I want to point out that this motion is not a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11401)|
| 3:10:07| It's important to note that we have fairly limited tools in terms of COVID mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11407)|
| 3:10:13| One of the tools that we had last year that we no longer have because of the State Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| of Education's rule was rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| You know, last year when we had kids that were either quarantined or we went on red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11420)|
| 3:10:24| or something like that, we can move kids to virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11424)|
| 3:10:27| My understanding right now is that if kids do end up quarantining, that we can count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11427)|
| 3:10:31| that as a excused absence and they will have access to potentially asynchronous materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11431)|
| 3:10:37| on online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11437)|
| 3:10:40| But I think if we're concerned about learning loss, there are going to be kids who are out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| for long periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| And so what I'm trying to do in this motion is to not upend the ability for the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11446)|
| 3:10:52| of schools for Superintendent Thomas to have access to all the strategies recommended for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11452)|
| 3:10:58| COVID mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| From my understanding from the law department's memo is that the superintendent still has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11460)|
| 3:11:05| the opportunity to implement every COVID protocol except for masking and because the board rescinded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11465)|
| 3:11:14| or rescinded policy C240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| So this is an attempt to give that authority back to the superintendent to be able to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11477)|
| 3:11:23| at discretion based on what's happening in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11487)|
| 3:11:28| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| I just, I'll keep my comments short as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11490)|
| 3:11:31| I just wanted to say that I completely agree with Ms. Bowns and Ms. Christie and just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11491)|
| 3:11:39| to stress, I also had the data part of Ms. Christie's comments written down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11499)|
| 3:11:46| I think that it should be a personal choice in families, but I think that families do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11506)|
| 3:11:52| need that data to make the most informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| I think that freedom is best with full information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| That way they can make this decision that best suits their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11522)|
| 3:12:03| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11523)|
| 3:12:04| Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| And I was really trying not to say something, but I have a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11525)|
| 3:12:12| I'm really, really torn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| Ms. McMillan's laughing at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| I'm really torn on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11536)|
| 3:12:18| I mean, this is not a, to me, a black and white issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11538)|
| 3:12:21| I've talked to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| I finally have just stopped replying to emails because I honestly just could not keep up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| but it's still, I know what the messaging out is there and I'm very torn about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11548)|
| 3:12:32| And I did propose another motion than Mr. McMillan's, I mean, than Mr. Watson's tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11552)|
| 3:12:38| that I thought had a little bit more of a stop date to it because where I'm really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| where I'm hearing parents that I really have feel for is it is the elementary school parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| that have not had the option to vaccinate their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11567)|
| 3:12:52| And I do think them have, I don't know that every parent or even a lot of parents are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11572)|
| 3:12:57| going to get vaccinated, vaccinate their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| But I think for those that are really fearful and really care about this, that that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11579)|
| 3:13:04| sort of seem like a relief to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11584)|
| 3:13:07| So that is where I see some importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11587)|
| 3:13:08| And I do see a difference between what's going on in high schools and what's going on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11588)|
| 3:13:12| the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11592)|
| 3:13:13| And I know it even goes up to like sixth grade, depending on age of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11593)|
| 3:13:18| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11598)|
| 3:13:19| I think the writing on the wall in our board is that this will not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11599)|
| 3:13:27| But what is interesting to me is we have in our community places like UT and Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11607)|
| 3:13:32| that are calling for mask mandates in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11612)|
| 3:13:36| And I have a lot of friends sending their kids to UT and a lot of them have very strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11616)|
| 3:13:41| anti-masking feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| Not one of them is not sending their kids to UT next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11623)|
| 3:13:46| I mean, they're doing what UT is telling them to do and the leadership at UT has told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11626)|
| 3:13:50| them they want the masks in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| And you know, I think there are even some people here who have kids going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11632)|
| 3:13:57| And I don't know that those kids are not going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| So you know, I think that a lot of times people do follow the rules when they're out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11639)|
| 3:14:04| even if they don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11644)|
| 3:14:05| And so I just want to put that out there that I just do kind of go with all of this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11645)|
| 3:14:12| a heavy heart because I do see both sides to it and I really do hear what everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11655)|
| 3:14:16| And what I do want to appreciate is last week and this week, all of our public forum speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11656)|
| 3:14:23| on either side really spoke from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| And I do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11665)|
| 3:14:26| I mean, I know each and every one of you is speaking because you think what you're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| to do is the right thing for your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| And I really do appreciate y'all coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| I mean, I know it takes a lot of time to come down here and sit through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11679)|
| 3:14:40| Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11680)|
| 3:14:41| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11681)|
| 3:14:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11682)|
| 3:14:50| I'd like to address several different things that have been brought up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| And so this may not be very, very organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11694)|
| 3:14:58| The first thing I want to think about is that people don't tend to make good choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11698)|
| 3:15:04| We don't make the choices that are in our best interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11704)|
| 3:15:09| And we often don't make the best choices in other people's interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11709)|
| 3:15:16| If we think about the choices that we make every day, we are not always making the healthiest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11716)|
| 3:15:24| choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11724)|
| 3:15:25| I'll also tell you that there's a s'mores donut at Krispy Kreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11725)|
| 3:15:30| It's not a good choice, but it's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11730)|
| 3:15:37| To the question of whether we have the authority, under 49.2203 in TCA, it says that one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11737)|
| 3:15:47| our duties and powers is to manage and control all public schools established or that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11747)|
| 3:15:53| be established under our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11753)|
| 3:15:57| That's pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| Governor Lee has said that we have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| So that authority shouldn't be something that we are still questioning when it is in law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11762)|
| 3:16:07| and when our governor has said that that is what we have unless someone wants to rescind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11767)|
| 3:16:13| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| The idea that PCR tests are not valid, that has come from a Canadian article that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11775)|
| 3:16:23| misrepresented and misquoted the World Health Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11783)|
| 3:16:29| So that is not accurate information that we're being given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11789)|
| 3:16:37| We were asked to supply studies that showed anything about masks being a valid mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11797)|
| 3:16:49| One of those is from the Mayo Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| This is in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| The Mayo Clinic has done a study on combined effects, so this is not just masking, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11814)|
| 3:17:01| the combined effects of masking and distance on aerosol exposure potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11821)|
| 3:17:09| The conclusion is that the results support the principle of layered protection to mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11829)|
| 3:17:19| transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11839)|
| 3:17:27| emphasize the importance of controlling the spread of aerosol at its source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11847)|
| 3:17:33| The source is our mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11853)|
| 3:17:37| The combination of masking and distancing reduced the exposure to exhaled particulates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11857)|
| 3:17:44| more than any individual measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11864)|
| 3:17:47| Combined measures remain the most effective way to combat the spread of respiratory infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11867)|
| 3:17:53| And that is exactly what Mr. Watson's motion does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11873)|
| 3:17:59| It gives the authority for combined measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11879)|
| 3:18:03| There's no one thing that we are going to do that's going to work 100% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11883)|
| 3:18:09| And I think we've all heard it described as a Swiss cheese kind of model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11889)|
| 3:18:14| You layer, you have a piece of Swiss cheese, there are lots of holes in it, but you layer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| one on top of the other on top of the other, and eventually there are no more holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11898)|
| 3:18:23| And that's what these mitigation strategies are supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11903)|
| 3:18:26| The more of them that we use, the better chance our kids have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11906)|
| 3:18:34| Our responsibility as board members is not to only consider the healthy kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11914)|
| 3:18:41| We're required to ensure that all of our students have access to in-person learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11921)|
| 3:18:47| Not to do that increases disparities, which is directly against our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11927)|
| 3:18:55| We don't have to look to just the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11935)|
| 3:18:58| We have state and local health departments that make the exact same recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11938)|
| 3:19:04| We have the American Academy of Pediatrics representing 67,000 pediatricians and giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11944)|
| 3:19:12| these same recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11952)|
| 3:19:16| To choose what public opinion may be over the recommendation of 67,000 pediatricians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11956)|
| 3:19:29| is irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| And I realize that's not the singular opinion, but that's a representative group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11970)|
| 3:19:43| To not ensure the safety of our students in our schools, when we know that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11983)|
| 3:19:50| an issue that impacts the safety of children in our schools, is criminally negligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=11990)|
| 3:20:01| For conduct to constitute criminal negligence, the accused must know or should know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12001)|
| 3:20:08| his or her conduct or the result of that conduct will imperil the life of another, given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12008)|
| 3:20:14| circumstances that exist when the conduct takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12014)|
| 3:20:19| We know that we are in a situation where instances of infection are rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12019)|
| 3:20:28| We know that they are significantly more for students right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12028)|
| 3:20:32| We know these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12032)|
| 3:20:35| We know that our students are at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| We know that no students under age 12 can be vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12038)|
| 3:20:43| We know these things, or we should know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12043)|
| 3:20:48| And for us to not consider those is extremely concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12048)|
| 3:20:57| We have a student rep who has asked us very clearly to listen to him as the representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12057)|
| 3:21:04| voice of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12064)|
| 3:21:08| This is something that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12068)|
| 3:21:12| We need to listen to that student voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12072)|
| 3:21:15| He is here for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12075)|
| 3:21:22| When personal choice impacts me, that's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| But when my personal choice negatively impacts other people, it's no longer personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12088)|
| 3:21:35| That's something that is very much a problem that I have put on other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12095)|
| 3:21:48| We talk about data a lot, and we talk about all this data that we have, and I have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| charts that show that community spread is right where it was at this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12112)|
| 3:21:58| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| But if we go and look at these charts of childhood infection, they're not where we were in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12120)|
| 3:22:07| They're where we were in late November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12127)|
| 3:22:11| But data that we don't have, data that I have asked for, and there's some conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12131)|
| 3:22:21| over whether we can have it, data we don't have involves data of our staff who have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12141)|
| 3:22:36| This board has not been told about staff who have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12156)|
| 3:22:43| And I think we need to seriously question why we are not given this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12163)|
| 3:22:51| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12171)|
| 3:22:55| It's important for us to know if we have staff who have died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12175)|
| 3:23:05| It's also important for us to know data that we had last year that we do not have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12185)|
| 3:23:12| We need to know if we have staff right now who have COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12192)|
| 3:23:20| And we don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12200)|
| 3:23:23| We need this information to make good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12203)|
| 3:23:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| Can we have quiet in the audience so we can hear the speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12210)|
| 3:23:40| The bottom line, I think, is that this isn't really about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12220)|
| 3:23:46| And it also doesn't change the vote that we took before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12226)|
| 3:23:51| So whether we do this or not, our superintendent should still be following the guidelines of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12231)|
| 3:24:02| the CDC and our state health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12242)|
| 3:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12247)|
| 3:24:08| Thank you, Ms. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12248)|
| 3:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12249)|
| 3:24:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12250)|
| 3:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12251)|
| 3:24:12| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12252)|
| 3:24:13| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12253)|
| 3:24:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12254)|
| 3:24:15| Mr. Chair and board, I'd like to ask a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12255)|
| 3:24:28| In reading Mr. Watson's motion here, just some clarification about align with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12268)|
| 3:24:37| We've had a lot of conversation about recommend and require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| And I think there's been some misunderstanding about what recommend means and what requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12281)|
| 3:24:47| means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12287)|
| 3:24:48| So I don't want to, if you approve this, I don't want to enter into this not really understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12288)|
| 3:24:55| the definition of align with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12295)|
| 3:24:59| Does that, can I substitute, I mean, I'm not making the motion, but just me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12299)|
| 3:25:05| can I substitute that this mandates following the guidance from the Center for Disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12305)|
| 3:25:12| and Control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12312)|
| 3:25:13| I mean, that's the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12313)|
| 3:25:16| Align with, synonyms mean coincide, correspond, standardize, blend, combine, correlate, fuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12316)|
| 3:25:23| join, match, merge, pair, unite, equal, and match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| So tell me exactly what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| And if you approve it, then you're telling me that I have, you're assigning me the sole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12331)|
| 3:25:37| authority to mandate masks and then enforce all disciplinary measures associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12337)|
| 3:25:44| folks who don't comply with that mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12344)|
| 3:25:47| So that's, if the board would just give me that, if you approve this, make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12347)|
| 3:25:52| we all understand that's what this is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| So, I mean, Mr. Dupler, you, well, you know, you please weigh in, too, if I'm saying something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12355)|
| 3:26:03| that's not exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| No, I, I mean, I agree with what you're saying, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| I mean, you know, if this, if the board's going to authorize you to, to pass down what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12372)|
| 3:26:20| the, I mean, what the board has the power to do, which is to mandate a mask, then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12380)|
| 3:26:25| need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12385)|
| 3:26:26| I think Mr. Watson said that it, that it does not mandate, but, but, but I think you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12386)|
| 3:26:31| to know one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12393)|
| 3:26:34| I just don't want this to pass and may not understand because it's already been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12394)|
| 3:26:40| clear that I'm not following the board's vote from last time you voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12400)|
| 3:26:45| So I don't want to not follow, pardon, double negatives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12405)|
| 3:26:50| There's another vote that the board takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12410)|
| 3:26:51| So, so, you know, just, just be sure that I'm understanding that I have the sole authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12411)|
| 3:26:57| to mandate masks in this school district, if this is approved, and then, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12417)|
| 3:27:03| to take disciplinary measures against those who don't comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12423)|
| 3:27:09| Mr. Watson, would you like to respond to your, your light is on, to your intention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12429)|
| 3:27:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12435)|
| 3:27:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12436)|
| 3:27:17| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12437)|
| 3:27:18| I appreciate that question and that point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12438)|
| 3:27:22| So from my understanding, since we've been entering into this conversation, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| for Knox County schools, but globally around guidance of public health, health, proficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12447)|
| 3:27:34| professionals, sorry, is it doesn't become mandated until the group with the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12454)|
| 3:27:41| mandates the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| The, that's the way it worked last year is all the guidance that we followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12463)|
| 3:27:49| It wasn't required until we required it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12469)|
| 3:27:52| I don't think the CDC is the, the group that's going to make the requirement or not make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12472)|
| 3:27:57| the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12477)|
| 3:27:58| And so what I, what I'm saying in this is that the expectation of the board, if approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12478)|
| 3:28:04| would be that you would work with your team and the Knox County Health Department, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12484)|
| 3:28:09| I know Jason is still meeting with Mr. Myers and the Tennessee Department of Health to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12489)|
| 3:28:16| make those decisions as things shift with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| And at some point, if you feel like based upon community transmission or which is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12499)|
| 3:28:25| I state here, that it's time to mandate master in that period, this would give you the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12505)|
| 3:28:30| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12510)|
| 3:28:31| If at some point with the guidance of the Knox County Health Department and the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12511)|
| 3:28:35| Department of Health and all those others that you get advice with that says we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12515)|
| 3:28:40| lift that, then I would expect you would be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12520)|
| 3:28:44| The, my intent in this is not to say, cause Ms. Babb brought this up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| There's no time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12529)|
| 3:28:50| There's no date end on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12530)|
| 3:28:52| My intent is not to say the moment this passes, Mr. Thomas is going to go mandate, mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12532)|
| 3:28:59| mask and it will never be lifted until the board votes on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| That's not my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12541)|
| 3:29:02| My intent is to give you the full authority to require masks, contact tracing, distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12542)|
| 3:29:09| additional cleaning, whatever you see fit based on public health officials guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12549)|
| 3:29:16| That's my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12556)|
| 3:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12557)|
| 3:29:18| So, so again, I guess I just want to be clear if the health department recommends it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12558)|
| 3:29:24| I don't mandate it and I don't do that, then what, what, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12564)|
| 3:29:30| Does that mean I'm going to be questioned by board members that want me to mandate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12570)|
| 3:29:34| and I'm going to be questioned by board members that don't want me to mandate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12574)|
| 3:29:38| You wouldn't be questioned by me whether or not, I can't speak for every board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12578)|
| 3:29:43| My understanding from the law department's memo is that we somehow stripped authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12583)|
| 3:29:49| from you related to mask when the policy sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12589)|
| 3:29:53| And what I'm trying to do is say, we need to give you that authority back to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12593)|
| 3:30:00| to implement that as needed and as required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12600)|
| 3:30:02| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12602)|
| 3:30:03| I'm not disagreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12603)|
| 3:30:04| I just heard to know what, when, when the health department or CDC or whoever recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12604)|
| 3:30:09| is the expectation from you as a board that I adhere to that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12609)|
| 3:30:16| I can only speak, I mean, so my, again, my intent with this is not for the board tap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12616)|
| 3:30:22| the way into this with you all the time and tell you what you should or should not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12622)|
| 3:30:27| I mean, personally, as a board member, I think we should follow the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12627)|
| 3:30:31| of the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| That's what I've continued to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12632)|
| 3:30:33| And that's what I've continued to try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| But I can't speak for the board as whole as a whole about what their intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12637)|
| 3:30:41| That is not my intent in this to require you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12641)|
| 3:30:45| The reality is right now, you could not do everything that the CDC recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12645)|
| 3:30:50| There's recommendations that the CDC provides right now to schools that we technically could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12650)|
| 3:30:55| not do in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12655)|
| 3:30:58| So to say we recommend, you know, if we say we're going to recommend CDC guidance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12658)|
| 3:31:02| we have to do everything, well, that's functionally not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12662)|
| 3:31:06| Their whole intent as an organization is to have layered strategies that local communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12666)|
| 3:31:11| decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12671)|
| 3:31:12| And that's what I'm asking for here is that we take that guidance of the CDC and we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12672)|
| 3:31:17| local decisions and that we empower you to do that as the manager of our schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12677)|
| 3:31:22| not have the board weigh in on that every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12682)|
| 3:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12686)|
| 3:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12690)|
| 3:31:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12691)|
| 3:31:32| Mr. Watson, I'm just, since you mentioned it, I'm going to talk just a moment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12692)|
| 3:31:42| the CDC and I know other members and I'm not picking on you, but you mentioned the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12702)|
| 3:31:52| I, for one, do not have any confidence in the CDC right now because they keep changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12712)|
| 3:32:03| things and I'm just wondering if how many people really know much about what the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12723)|
| 3:32:16| is right now since this lady, this last lady, took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12736)|
| 3:32:22| I think it's a totally different organization than it has been in the past and I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12742)|
| 3:32:31| that is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12751)|
| 3:32:34| I also don't think that based on what we talked about last week that, and what the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12754)|
| 3:32:43| told us and what we talked about, that the superintendent has the authority to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12763)|
| 3:32:53| on masks or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| I think it's this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12777)|
| 3:33:02| That's why if we're going to vote on something, I'm not voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12782)|
| 3:33:08| I just wanted everybody to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12788)|
| 3:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12793)|
| 3:33:14| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12794)|
| 3:33:16| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12796)|
| 3:33:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12798)|
| 3:33:20| I'd like to try to answer part of Mr. Thomas' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12800)|
| 3:33:26| I believe that this and our previous motion were to allow the superintendent to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12806)|
| 3:33:36| as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12816)|
| 3:33:38| And the piece that I have had the most issue with is a piece that came out that said we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12818)|
| 3:33:48| would not do something all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12828)|
| 3:33:52| Well, that immediately took away the ability to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12832)|
| 3:33:58| That got rid of the ability, I mean, I guess you could have changed again, but when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12838)|
| 3:34:04| put out a statement that says, no, we're not going to make any changes, when we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12844)|
| 3:34:10| know what might happen, that's where I found it problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12850)|
| 3:34:16| Because we're trying to give you the ability to make those changes as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12856)|
| 3:34:22| So we want it to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12862)|
| 3:34:24| We want it to be something, I'm saying we, I, let me say I, something that you can adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12864)|
| 3:34:32| as you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| We have no idea what could happen tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| And if we think about even as recently as when we took our TVA tower tours, we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12876)|
| 3:34:42| that on Monday, when you took a tour, you didn't need masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12882)|
| 3:34:46| On Wednesday, when we took a tour, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12886)|
| 3:34:50| Things change that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12890)|
| 3:34:52| And our board can't meet that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12892)|
| 3:34:54| So we need you to have the power to make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12894)|
| 3:34:58| And we need it to be flexible, and we need you to be empowered to do it without anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12898)|
| 3:35:06| saying, here's how it's going to be all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12906)|
| 3:35:10| I think that's where people have a problem, because when we say, we're not doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12910)|
| 3:35:16| all year, and then the situation changes, we have backed ourselves into a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12916)|
| 3:35:22| And that is why I want to have language that allows you to work with everyone you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12922)|
| 3:35:30| to work with to make sure that we are making good choices for all of our students based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12930)|
| 3:35:38| on whatever information we have at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12938)|
| 3:35:42| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12942)|
| 3:35:44| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12944)|
| 3:35:46| If I can just throw in real quick before we go to Ms. Bounds, if I'm not mistaken, back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12946)|
| 3:35:50| in April, the CDC was on that document, and the board took it out, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12950)|
| 3:35:58| So I may be wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| But I think it was on there initially, and then we asked that it be taken out before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12960)|
| 3:36:04| it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| So I'm wondering why the CDC is here instead of Tennessee Department of Health or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12966)|
| 3:36:14| other organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12974)|
| 3:36:16| And then my other comment would be, I would be also a little concerned about this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12976)|
| 3:36:28| asking the superintendent to make this kind of choice when we are the ones who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12988)|
| 3:36:34| elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12994)|
| 3:36:36| And I think that we're here to uphold the freedom and liberty of people, and so I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=12996)|
| 3:36:44| think people can make good choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13004)|
| 3:36:46| And I think right now, people can make whichever choice they want to in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13006)|
| 3:36:50| So those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13014)|
| 3:36:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13016)|
| 3:36:58| So we have a motion to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13018)|
| 3:37:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13021)|
| 3:37:02| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13022)|
| 3:37:04| Is there discussion on calling for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13024)|
| 3:37:08| I would like to respond to your direct question, Jimmy, if that's okay, before we call for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13028)|
| 3:37:12| the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13032)|
| 3:37:13| So we're voting now on calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13033)|
| 3:37:16| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13036)|
| 3:37:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13037)|
| 3:37:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13038)|
| 3:37:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13039)|
| 3:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13040)|
| 3:37:21| Ms. Coatney, do you want to reread the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13041)|
| 3:37:26| Mr. Watson's motion is to authorize the director of schools to implement layered prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210811?start=13046)|
