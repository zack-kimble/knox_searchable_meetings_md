| 3:52:06| The applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13926)|
| 3:52:08| initially offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13928)|
| 3:52:10| to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13930)|
| 3:52:12| allowing pedestrians to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| to use the pathway down Sequoia Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| That's a quote, right? And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13936)|
| 3:52:18| he offered a gentleman's agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13938)|
| 3:52:20| to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13940)|
| 3:52:22| that access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13942)|
| 3:52:24| and only after some resistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13944)|
| 3:52:26| offered an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13946)|
| 3:52:28| He refused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13948)|
| 3:52:30| to consider a public right-of-way in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13950)|
| 3:52:32| it sounds like, from the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13952)|
| 3:52:34| We've talked a lot about this, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13954)|
| 3:52:36| I think you know what I'm going to say, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13956)|
| 3:52:38| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13958)|
| 3:52:40| and still an easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| he insisted will have an indemnification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13962)|
| 3:52:44| clause that shields him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13964)|
| 3:52:46| from liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| So easements are problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13968)|
| 3:52:50| They're a little bit more easy to neglect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| than sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| public right-of-way. They're hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| to find. You've got to find them in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13976)|
| 3:52:58| subdivision plot. They're not labeled on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13978)|
| 3:53:00| KGIS map like this very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13980)|
| 3:53:02| And while I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| to trust the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13984)|
| 3:53:06| applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13986)|
| 3:53:08| I find myself doubting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13988)|
| 3:53:10| For example, as mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13990)|
| 3:53:12| quote, the right-of-way is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13992)|
| 3:53:14| only utilized by two property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13994)|
| 3:53:16| owners that lie to the east and west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13996)|
| 3:53:18| of their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13998)|
| 3:53:20| for access to their private residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14000)|
| 3:53:22| That was in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14002)|
| 3:53:24| Yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14004)|
| 3:53:26| there was email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14006)|
| 3:53:28| conversations between the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14008)|
| 3:53:30| and us. I'm representing myself, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14010)|
| 3:53:32| not the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14012)|
| 3:53:34| Before this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14014)|
| 3:53:36| was submitted about pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14016)|
| 3:53:38| access, July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14018)|
| 3:53:40| there was discussions about pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14022)|
| 3:53:44| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| it's not true. It's deceptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14026)|
| 3:53:48| in my mind, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14028)|
| 3:53:50| when you enter a relationship with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14030)|
| 3:53:52| someone from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14032)|
| 3:53:54| point of deception, then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14034)|
| 3:53:56| find it hard to trust that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14036)|
| 3:53:58| Similarly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14038)|
| 3:54:00| this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14040)|
| 3:54:02| you can get the gist, that map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14042)|
| 3:54:04| is about 150 houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14044)|
| 3:54:06| that will have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14046)|
| 3:54:08| walk access extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14048)|
| 3:54:10| by this closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14050)|
| 3:54:12| if it is a closure, if it's practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14052)|
| 3:54:14| or effectively a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14054)|
| 3:54:16| closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14056)|
| 3:54:18| I have 10 kids that live on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14058)|
| 3:54:20| block, most of them toddlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14060)|
| 3:54:22| It's about four extra football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14062)|
| 3:54:24| fields of walking to go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14064)|
| 3:54:26| to the other access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14066)|
| 3:54:28| When you're dragging a toddler, four extra football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14068)|
| 3:54:30| fields actually is kind of a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14070)|
| 3:54:34| That's sort of my main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14074)|
| 3:54:36| point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| There's a lot of reasons that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| applicant has, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| suggested, manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| for this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| Things like reckless driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14086)|
| 3:54:48| on this little tiny stretch of roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14088)|
| 3:54:50| was one of the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| reasons for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14092)|
| 3:54:54| Nobody's ever observed that, people that have lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14094)|
| 3:54:56| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14096)|
| 3:54:58| The owner of this property just bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14098)|
| 3:55:00| this parcel, was inquiring about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14100)|
| 3:55:02| buying this, closing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14102)|
| 3:55:04| right-of-way before he bought the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14104)|
| 3:55:06| He's never lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| and so a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14108)|
| 3:55:10| issues that he's raised seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14110)|
| 3:55:12| contrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14112)|
| 3:55:14| This access has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14114)|
| 3:55:16| been there since at least 1935.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14116)|
| 3:55:18| KGIS historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14118)|
| 3:55:20| aerial map shows this access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14120)|
| 3:55:22| point and all the access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14122)|
| 3:55:24| are still in the public right-of-way, every one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14124)|
| 3:55:26| them, that has existed since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14126)|
| 3:55:28| the 1935 map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14128)|
| 3:55:30| This would be the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14130)|
| 3:55:32| so this is a generational issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| first time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14134)|
| 3:55:36| any access way along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14136)|
| 3:55:38| this map has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14138)|
| 3:55:40| I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14140)|
| 3:55:42| really important to understand that this is not just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14142)|
| 3:55:44| me or my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14144)|
| 3:55:46| This is about hundreds of houses now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14146)|
| 3:55:48| in the past and in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14148)|
| 3:55:50| that will have potential access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14150)|
| 3:55:52| to this way closed, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14152)|
| 3:55:54| for what purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14154)|
| 3:55:56| To satisfy two people who really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| have all the access they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| Their concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14160)|
| 3:56:02| still going to be concerns, whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| this access, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14164)|
| 3:56:06| this line is moved from one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14166)|
| 3:56:08| to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| With that, I urge you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14170)|
| 3:56:12| maintain access in the public domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14172)|
| 3:56:14| in the public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14174)|
| 3:56:16| not an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14176)|
| 3:56:18| Southgate has a 20-foot public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14178)|
| 3:56:20| down the street, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14180)|
| 3:56:22| and not put it under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| the control of adjoining property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14184)|
| 3:56:26| owners. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14186)|
| 3:56:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14188)|
| 3:56:30| Chair will recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14192)|
| 3:56:34| Thank you. This is a question for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14194)|
| 3:56:36| just for my own clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14196)|
| 3:56:38| Reading the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14198)|
| 3:56:40| it says there would be public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14200)|
| 3:56:42| access as an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14202)|
| 3:56:44| That's part of the condition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14204)|
| 3:56:46| is being recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14206)|
| 3:56:48| for the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14208)|
| 3:56:50| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14210)|
| 3:56:52| can a human walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14212)|
| 3:56:54| through there to access the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14214)|
| 3:56:56| That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14216)|
| 3:56:58| is being allowed with this 15-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14218)|
| 3:57:00| access, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14220)|
| 3:57:04| And if someone tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14224)|

| 3:57:08| what recourse would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14230)|
| 3:57:18| What recourse would they have if they were turned away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14238)|
| 3:57:20| Yes, if someone was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14240)|
| 3:57:22| walking there, they're used to using this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14242)|
| 3:57:24| and someone said, you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14244)|
| 3:57:26| go through there, what recourse would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14246)|
| 3:57:28| they have? Call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14248)|
| 3:57:32| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14252)|
| 3:57:34| Yeah, I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14254)|
| 3:57:36| point out that we did get a letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14256)|
| 3:57:38| City Engineering on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14258)|
| 3:57:40| and we rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14260)|
| 3:57:42| City Engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14262)|
| 3:57:44| KUB to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14264)|
| 3:57:46| us whether or not these old paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14266)|
| 3:57:48| access points are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14268)|
| 3:57:50| still viable or any benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14270)|
| 3:57:52| going forward, and we did get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14272)|
| 3:57:54| letter, which we typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14274)|
| 3:57:56| don't get, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14276)|
| 3:57:58| when we ask about these things being closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14278)|
| 3:58:00| Very rarely do I remember City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14280)|
| 3:58:02| or KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14282)|
| 3:58:04| saying that, yeah, go ahead and close them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14284)|
| 3:58:06| This particular letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14286)|
| 3:58:08| that we got from, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14288)|
| 3:58:10| Curtis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14290)|
| 3:58:12| says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14292)|
| 3:58:14| that an easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14294)|
| 3:58:16| would be required centered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14296)|
| 3:58:18| 7.5 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14298)|
| 3:58:20| either side of that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14300)|
| 3:58:22| and I'm assuming that the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14302)|
| 3:58:24| location would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14304)|
| 3:58:26| worked out with City Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14306)|
| 3:58:28| as to the best part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14308)|
| 3:58:30| or it would be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14310)|
| 3:58:32| center of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14312)|
| 3:58:34| the flag is now, Curtis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14314)|
| 3:58:36| Yes, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14316)|
| 3:58:38| correct. The intent was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14318)|
| 3:58:40| provide the easement down the center of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14320)|
| 3:58:42| the existing right-of-way that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| Typically, when right-of-ways are closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| they're closed to the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14326)|
| 3:58:48| And then typically, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14328)|
| 3:58:50| city, when you do some sort of easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14330)|
| 3:58:52| that gives public benefit, is there not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14332)|
| 3:58:54| maintenance requirements and things that go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14334)|
| 3:58:56| with those easements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14336)|
| 3:59:00| Probably would depend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| on whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14342)|
| 3:59:04| there was an improved facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14344)|
| 3:59:06| in there or not. I think the city wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14346)|
| 3:59:08| maintain the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14348)|
| 3:59:10| provide a facility someday if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14350)|
| 3:59:12| chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14352)|
| 3:59:16| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14356)|
| 3:59:18| Do you recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14358)|
| 3:59:20| this commercial graph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14360)|
| 3:59:22| Yeah, first off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14362)|
| 3:59:24| I've looked at this three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14364)|
| 3:59:26| I've pulled down in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14366)|
| 3:59:28| into the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14368)|
| 3:59:30| that is being worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14370)|
| 3:59:32| on. I always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14372)|
| 3:59:34| thought that this was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14374)|
| 3:59:36| driveway. It didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14376)|
| 3:59:38| look like a street to me. It looked like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14378)|
| 3:59:40| driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14380)|
| 3:59:44| I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14384)|
| 3:59:46| anybody got from the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14386)|
| 3:59:48| of that driveway or the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14388)|
| 3:59:50| to the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| without a machete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14392)|
| 3:59:54| I'm telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14394)|
| 3:59:56| the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14396)|
| 3:59:58| That is not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14398)|
| 4:00:00| a walkable trail through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| there. You'd have to beat your way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| through and cut your way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14404)|
| 4:00:06| That's the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14406)|
| 4:00:08| The second part was when I tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| to back out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14410)|
| 4:00:12| this place where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14412)|
| 4:00:14| working, the house they're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14414)|
| 4:00:18| you can't hardly do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14418)|
| 4:00:20| without...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14420)|
| 4:00:22| If they divide this street in two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14422)|
| 4:00:24| and give half of it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14424)|
| 4:00:26| each side, how can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14426)|
| 4:00:28| you do it without getting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| other person's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14430)|
| 4:00:32| I don't think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14432)|
| 4:00:34| can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| That needs to be a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14436)|
| 4:00:38| street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14438)|
| 4:00:40| We can change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14440)|
| 4:00:42| to right-of-ways and this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14442)|
| 4:00:44| but what are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14444)|
| 4:00:46| It's still a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14446)|
| 4:00:48| access, and nobody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14448)|
| 4:00:50| going to use it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14450)|
| 4:00:52| the two people driving in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14452)|
| 4:00:54| of their houses on each side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14454)|
| 4:00:56| why do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14456)|
| 4:00:58| Why not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14458)|
| 4:01:00| leave it the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14460)|
| 4:01:02| It's a public street or it's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14462)|
| 4:01:04| public right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| What are the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14466)|
| 4:01:08| Can I address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14468)|
| 4:01:10| homeowners' concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| Can I present those to Mr. Graff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14472)|
| 4:01:14| Right now, this is a discussion between commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14474)|
| 4:01:16| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14476)|
| 4:01:18| We didn't give the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14478)|
| 4:01:20| an opportunity to speak yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| at all, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14482)|
| 4:01:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14484)|
| 4:01:26| I may be wrong, but I don't think we've given the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14486)|
| 4:01:28| an opportunity to speak yet, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14488)|
| 4:01:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| One minute of my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14492)|
| 4:01:34| I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14494)|
| 4:01:36| there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14496)|
| 4:01:38| more to it, but I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14498)|
| 4:01:40| ask the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14500)|
| 4:01:42| about the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| question, why would the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14504)|
| 4:01:46| homeowner want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14506)|
| 4:01:48| do this and how does that affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14508)|
| 4:01:50| the next-door neighbor if this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14510)|
| 4:01:52| to be closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14512)|
| 4:01:56| The new property owner that initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14516)|
| 4:01:58| all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14518)|
| 4:02:00| is going to place his elderly mother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14520)|
| 4:02:02| in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14522)|
| 4:02:04| With that being a public street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14524)|
| 4:02:06| the public can pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14526)|
| 4:02:08| back in there, just as Mr. Graff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14528)|
| 4:02:10| relayed that he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14530)|
| 4:02:12| in a car, and they could pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14532)|
| 4:02:14| basically right up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14534)|
| 4:02:16| the garage door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14536)|

| 4:02:26| law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14546)|
| 4:02:28| in because she's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14548)|
| 4:02:30| Law enforcement has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14550)|
| 4:02:32| mechanism to ask them to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14552)|
| 4:02:34| So that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14554)|
| 4:02:36| obviously the concern of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14556)|
| 4:02:38| my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14558)|
| 4:02:40| It was represented that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14560)|
| 4:02:42| I stated as the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14562)|
| 4:02:44| that fast traffic had been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14564)|
| 4:02:46| That is not true. I never made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14566)|
| 4:02:48| statement. The homebuyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14568)|
| 4:02:50| did. I'm not going to deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14570)|
| 4:02:54| But that's his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14574)|
| 4:02:56| concern. That's why he wants to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14576)|
| 4:02:58| He is 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14578)|
| 4:03:00| both parties, to answer your other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14580)|
| 4:03:02| question, are in agreement with staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14582)|
| 4:03:04| recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14584)|
| 4:03:06| and condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14586)|
| 4:03:08| that a 15-foot-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14588)|
| 4:03:10| pedestrian access easement be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14590)|
| 4:03:12| put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14592)|
| 4:03:14| If this body and City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14594)|
| 4:03:16| rules in favor of closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14596)|
| 4:03:18| we will then be putting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14598)|
| 4:03:20| plat of record to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14600)|
| 4:03:24| opposition's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14604)|
| 4:03:26| We will put a plat of record that clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14606)|
| 4:03:28| defines that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14608)|
| 4:03:30| That it is there and it is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14610)|
| 4:03:32| public use. And I'll be happy to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14612)|
| 4:03:34| any other questions, and I hope I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14614)|
| 4:03:36| answered yours, Mr. Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14616)|
| 4:03:40| I pulled in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14620)|
| 4:03:42| I always thought that was a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14622)|
| 4:03:44| Yes, sir. I agree. It looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14624)|
| 4:03:46| a driveway, and it is a driveway. I would never have pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14626)|
| 4:03:48| in there unless I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14628)|
| 4:03:50| looking at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14630)|
| 4:03:52| agenda for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14632)|
| 4:03:54| I thought, hey, this is a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14634)|
| 4:03:56| So I pulled down to see what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14636)|
| 4:03:58| And you had every right to, sir. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14638)|
| 4:04:00| But so does anybody else at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14640)|
| 4:04:02| All right. Let's move on. The Chair will recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14642)|
| 4:04:04| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14644)|
| 4:04:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I'm just going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14646)|
| 4:04:08| and say I think staff got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14648)|
| 4:04:10| City Engineering submitted something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14650)|
| 4:04:12| asking for this. KUB has submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14652)|
| 4:04:14| So with that, I would move that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14654)|
| 4:04:16| approve item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14656)|
| 4:04:18| number nine per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14658)|
| 4:04:20| Item number seven per staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14660)|
| 4:04:22| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14662)|
| 4:04:24| Before we go to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14664)|
| 4:04:26| recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14666)|
| 4:04:28| I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14668)|
| 4:04:30| staff recommendation solves two problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14670)|
| 4:04:32| One, it does not limit access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14672)|
| 4:04:34| to the public, and whether it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14674)|
| 4:04:36| right-of-way or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14676)|
| 4:04:38| an easement, there's a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14678)|
| 4:04:40| of the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14680)|
| 4:04:42| saying, don't come through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14682)|
| 4:04:44| But that's an unlawful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14684)|
| 4:04:46| act, and that can be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14686)|
| 4:04:48| by calling KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14688)|
| 4:04:50| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14690)|
| 4:04:52| I would be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14692)|
| 4:04:54| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14694)|
| 4:04:56| So the only thing I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14696)|
| 4:04:58| when I was driving down there is that there's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14698)|
| 4:05:00| easement, or excuse me, another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14700)|
| 4:05:02| right-of-way just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14702)|
| 4:05:04| further down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14704)|
| 4:05:06| down Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14706)|
| 4:05:08| You know, it's funny that we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14708)|
| 4:05:10| really addressed these in all these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14710)|
| 4:05:12| but just two months ago we had one at West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14712)|
| 4:05:14| Hill, same thing, and we denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14714)|
| 4:05:16| Now we're faced with another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14716)|
| 4:05:18| one, and then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14718)|
| 4:05:20| another right-of-way just like a block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14720)|
| 4:05:22| down the street for that same park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14722)|
| 4:05:24| Are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14724)|
| 4:05:26| going to be dealing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14726)|
| 4:05:28| again? And now we're putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14728)|
| 4:05:30| in a situation where if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14730)|
| 4:05:32| they want to close their right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14732)|
| 4:05:34| they're not going to be able to because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14734)|
| 4:05:36| we don't have, I mean, I'm sure Parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14736)|
| 4:05:38| Rec needs access at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14738)|
| 4:05:40| for many of these spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14740)|
| 4:05:42| I guess my feeling is that it's a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14742)|
| 4:05:44| right-of-way. It's worked for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14744)|
| 4:05:46| I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14746)|
| 4:05:48| needs to stay with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14748)|
| 4:05:50| and not let it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14750)|
| 4:05:52| a problem for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14752)|
| 4:05:54| down the road with the other public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14754)|
| 4:05:56| that's just one block down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14756)|
| 4:05:58| City Engineering did give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14758)|
| 4:06:00| a letter on that other one that you're speaking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14760)|
| 4:06:02| saying that they did not recommend the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14762)|
| 4:06:04| So they said no. That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14764)|
| 4:06:08| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14768)|
| 4:06:10| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14770)|
| 4:06:12| This is such a crazy deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14772)|
| 4:06:14| We have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14774)|
| 4:06:16| big beautiful park, and two people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14776)|
| 4:06:18| benefiting out of this. The two people that live on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14778)|
| 4:06:20| either side are getting the only free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14780)|
| 4:06:22| property on Cherish Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14782)|
| 4:06:24| I mean, it's a 60-foot piece of ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14784)|
| 4:06:26| utilities weren't in it. It's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14786)|
| 4:06:28| a couple hundred thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14788)|
| 4:06:30| Personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14790)|
| 4:06:32| I kind of think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14792)|
| 4:06:34| it ought to stay the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14794)|
| 4:06:36| for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14796)|
| 4:06:38| But if we are going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14798)|
| 4:06:40| just dividing these easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14800)|
| 4:06:42| and giving them to whoever lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14802)|
| 4:06:44| adjacent to them for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14804)|
| 4:06:46| maybe we ought to consider a donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14806)|
| 4:06:48| to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14808)|
| 4:06:50| That property is 60,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14810)|
| 4:06:52| via bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14812)|
| 4:06:54| We do this in homeowners associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14814)|
| 4:06:56| If we have a common area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14816)|
| 4:06:58| joins somebody and there's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14818)|
| 4:07:00| they pay the HOA for this little strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14820)|
| 4:07:02| and we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14822)|
| 4:07:04| I'm not trying to be unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14824)|
| 4:07:06| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14826)|
| 4:07:08| It's a beautiful park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14828)|
| 4:07:10| and how can you have too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14830)|
| 4:07:12| access to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14832)|
| 4:07:14| Does the city...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14834)|
| 4:07:16| I know they don't oppose it going, but is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14836)|
| 4:07:18| beneficial for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14838)|
| 4:07:20| not to have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14840)|
| 4:07:22| I can't imagine there's that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14842)|
| 4:07:24| maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14844)|
| 4:07:26| Anyway, those are my thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14846)|
| 4:07:28| You know, the way I look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14848)|

| 4:07:32| to close it, and I'm not hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14852)|
| 4:07:34| it from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14854)|
| 4:07:36| because they're worried that somebody may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14856)|
| 4:07:38| pull down there and may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14858)|
| 4:07:40| scare somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14860)|
| 4:07:44| just by hyper-verbally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14864)|
| 4:07:46| There's no reason to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14866)|
| 4:07:48| start closing a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14868)|
| 4:07:50| road in the event that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14870)|
| 4:07:52| somebody could come down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14872)|
| 4:07:54| and upset somebody else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14874)|
| 4:07:56| life. And it backs up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14876)|
| 4:07:58| to a park. I mean, it's been there for 80 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14878)|
| 4:08:00| been maintained to some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14880)|
| 4:08:04| I can't see where the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14884)|
| 4:08:06| owner is getting injured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14886)|
| 4:08:08| by this right-of-way being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14888)|
| 4:08:10| Personally, I'm going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14890)|
| 4:08:12| opposing closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14892)|
| 4:08:14| I'd say leave it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14894)|
| 4:08:16| Commissioner Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14896)|
| 4:08:18| You know, we also don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14898)|
| 4:08:20| know what the city may want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14900)|
| 4:08:22| to do. The city may need access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14902)|
| 4:08:24| in the future to that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14904)|
| 4:08:26| They may want to put a small parking lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14906)|
| 4:08:28| They may want to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14908)|
| 4:08:30| It's not really hurting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14910)|
| 4:08:32| either property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14912)|
| 4:08:34| owner to have that street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14914)|
| 4:08:36| there, but it could limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14916)|
| 4:08:38| what the possibility is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14918)|
| 4:08:40| forward if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14920)|
| 4:08:42| approve closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14922)|
| 4:08:48| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14928)|
| 4:08:50| I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14930)|
| 4:08:52| say I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14932)|
| 4:08:54| appreciate what Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14934)|
| 4:08:56| shared about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14936)|
| 4:08:58| compensation for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14938)|
| 4:09:00| If it was to be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14940)|
| 4:09:02| we're just giving property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14942)|
| 4:09:04| away, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14944)|
| 4:09:06| that's a huge deal. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14946)|
| 4:09:08| thanks for raising that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14948)|
| 4:09:10| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14950)|
| 4:09:12| McGrath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14952)|
| 4:09:14| I'm going to make a motion that we deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14954)|
| 4:09:16| that parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14956)|
| 4:09:18| There's a motion already on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14958)|
| 4:09:20| by Commissioners Eddie Smith and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14960)|
| 4:09:22| a second by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14962)|
| 4:09:24| to approve the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14964)|
| 4:09:26| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14966)|
| 4:09:28| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14968)|
| 4:09:30| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14970)|
| 4:09:32| To Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14972)|
| 4:09:34| the question brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14974)|
| 4:09:36| we're not giving anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14976)|
| 4:09:38| They are taking it over. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14978)|
| 4:09:40| that will also go against what they have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14980)|
| 4:09:42| in property taxes. So they're going to be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14982)|
| 4:09:44| on that property that is now put on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14984)|
| 4:09:46| their property. So they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14986)|
| 4:09:48| paying over time. When you think about what's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14988)|
| 4:09:50| that area, they're going to be paying towards it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14990)|
| 4:09:52| The city now no longer has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14992)|
| 4:09:54| responsibility to keep it maintained, mowed and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| That now falls on the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14996)|
| 4:09:58| And again, we have a letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=14998)|
| 4:10:00| city engineering saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15000)|
| 4:10:02| we recommend closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15002)|
| 4:10:04| this with the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15004)|
| 4:10:06| into the park. The pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15006)|
| 4:10:08| right of way will still maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15008)|
| 4:10:10| but a tiny road that no one even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15010)|
| 4:10:12| thought was a road will now not be a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15012)|
| 4:10:14| It's just a foot traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15014)|
| 4:10:16| entrance into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15016)|
| 4:10:18| I think the letter said we don't oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15018)|
| 4:10:20| I thought that's what the city's letter said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15020)|
| 4:10:22| Let's recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15022)|
| 4:10:24| Curtis, do you want to weigh in on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15024)|
| 4:10:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15026)|
| 4:10:28| Thank you for the opportunity to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15028)|
| 4:10:30| I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15030)|
| 4:10:32| point out we have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15032)|
| 4:10:34| right of ways that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15034)|
| 4:10:36| in the city that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15036)|
| 4:10:38| maybe underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15038)|
| 4:10:40| or undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15040)|
| 4:10:42| completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15042)|
| 4:10:44| for whatever reason. Over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15044)|
| 4:10:46| a lot of flats have been recorded. There's flats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15046)|
| 4:10:48| that go back well over 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15048)|
| 4:10:50| Not all of the right of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15050)|
| 4:10:52| ways were improved at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15052)|
| 4:10:54| time. So, in some instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15054)|
| 4:10:56| it would be difficult to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15056)|
| 4:10:58| a roadway or a facility in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15058)|
| 4:11:00| right of ways to modern standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15060)|
| 4:11:02| In some instances, it would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15062)|
| 4:11:04| nearly impossible to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15064)|
| 4:11:06| based on current standards for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15066)|
| 4:11:08| day. So, in some instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15068)|
| 4:11:10| there are a lot of existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15070)|
| 4:11:12| right of ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15072)|
| 4:11:14| won't be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15074)|
| 4:11:16| for that use. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15076)|
| 4:11:18| closure a lot of times is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15078)|
| 4:11:20| a good way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15080)|
| 4:11:22| address those right of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15082)|
| 4:11:24| With regards to this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15084)|
| 4:11:26| I'm not sure. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15086)|
| 4:11:28| if the city is maintaining this as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15088)|
| 4:11:30| roadway or if it's just being maintained by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15090)|
| 4:11:32| private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15092)|
| 4:11:34| owners as a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15094)|
| 4:11:36| I know in some instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15096)|
| 4:11:38| I'm not sure with this one, but in some instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15098)|
| 4:11:40| folks have built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15100)|
| 4:11:42| driveways in right of way over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15102)|
| 4:11:44| May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15104)|
| 4:11:46| have been approved or not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15106)|
| 4:11:48| Most of the time they're usually not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15108)|
| 4:11:50| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15110)|
| 4:11:52| in those instances, we're not maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15112)|
| 4:11:54| those driveways that are in right of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15114)|
| 4:11:56| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15116)|
| 4:11:58| I just point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15118)|
| 4:12:00| all that out to say sometimes it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15120)|
| 4:12:02| make sense to do a closure just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15122)|
| 4:12:04| to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15124)|
| 4:12:06| to utilize the facility for what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15126)|
| 4:12:08| for would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15128)|
| 4:12:10| less practical than it would be today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15130)|
| 4:12:12| if we were planning something brand new from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15132)|
| 4:12:14| scratch. For instance, if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| a roadway like this, if we're going to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| roadway in a right of way like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15138)|
| 4:12:20| normally we don't want to have a dead end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15140)|
| 4:12:22| right of way that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15142)|
| 4:12:24| have a turnaround on. In this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15144)|
| 4:12:26| instance, folks would essentially have to back all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15146)|
| 4:12:28| way back out to Cherokee Boulevard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15148)|
| 4:12:30| turn around, especially if there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15150)|
| 4:12:32| fire truck or an ambulance or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15152)|

| 4:12:36| or something like that on the street that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15156)|
| 4:12:38| dead ended. So, a lot of times now when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15158)|
| 4:12:40| you look at concept plans and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15160)|
| 4:12:42| like that, we have cul-de-sacs, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15162)|
| 4:12:44| hammerhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15164)|
| 4:12:46| type turnarounds that meet certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15166)|
| 4:12:48| vehicle designs, like for fire trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15168)|
| 4:12:50| and things like that. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15170)|
| 4:12:52| those are some of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15172)|
| 4:12:54| why, at least from an engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15174)|
| 4:12:56| standpoint, it does make sense to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15176)|
| 4:12:58| look at closures on certain right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15178)|
| 4:13:00| of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15180)|
| 4:13:02| With regards to properties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15182)|
| 4:13:04| values of that, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15184)|
| 4:13:06| in some instances there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15186)|
| 4:13:08| between fee-owned property, and Benny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15188)|
| 4:13:10| can probably explain this better than I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15190)|
| 4:13:12| because I'm not a surveyor, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15192)|
| 4:13:14| there's a difference between fee-owned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15194)|
| 4:13:16| which may be something that the city owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15196)|
| 4:13:18| like a city park, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15198)|
| 4:13:20| having a right of way somewhere. A lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15200)|
| 4:13:22| the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15202)|
| 4:13:24| owners actually own the fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15204)|
| 4:13:26| title to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15206)|
| 4:13:28| under that right of way, so the city has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15208)|
| 4:13:30| right of way over that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15210)|
| 4:13:32| but those folks actually have rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15212)|
| 4:13:34| to it if the city abandons the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15214)|
| 4:13:36| of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15216)|
| 4:13:38| Commissioner Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| Smith. Okay, in the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15220)|
| 4:13:42| we're going to vote on this, if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15222)|
| 4:13:44| passes, is the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15224)|
| 4:13:46| for access specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15226)|
| 4:13:48| like drawn in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15228)|
| 4:13:50| specific location, or is it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15230)|
| 4:13:52| somewhere there's a right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15232)|
| 4:13:54| It will be drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15234)|
| 4:13:56| in. The city has specified that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15236)|
| 4:13:58| will be seven and a half foot on each side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15238)|
| 4:14:00| of the common boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15240)|
| 4:14:02| I would, to add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15242)|
| 4:14:04| what Curtis said about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15244)|
| 4:14:06| the feasibility of this ever being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15246)|
| 4:14:08| street, from the terminus of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15248)|
| 4:14:10| driveway as it drops down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15250)|
| 4:14:12| into the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15252)|
| 4:14:14| I checked it, it's 21%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15254)|
| 4:14:16| grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15256)|
| 4:14:18| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15258)|
| 4:14:20| if you were to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15260)|
| 4:14:22| establish an extension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15262)|
| 4:14:24| that road into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15264)|
| 4:14:26| what is the park, owned by TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15266)|
| 4:14:28| you would have to build retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15268)|
| 4:14:30| walls along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15270)|
| 4:14:32| two limits of the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| Considerably high retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15274)|
| 4:14:36| Would you not agree, Curtis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15276)|
| 4:14:38| But you will have a called out easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15278)|
| 4:14:40| Yes. People will know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15280)|
| 4:14:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15282)|
| 4:14:44| Let's bring this to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15284)|
| 4:14:46| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15286)|
| 4:14:48| So we have a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15288)|
| 4:14:50| Commissioner Eddie Smith, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15290)|
| 4:14:52| Commissioner Roth to approve the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15292)|
| 4:14:54| of the right of way per staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15294)|
| 4:14:56| recommendation. All in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15296)|
| 4:14:58| the motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15298)|
| 4:15:00| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15300)|
| 4:15:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15306)|
| 4:15:08| So anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15308)|
| 4:15:10| I was going to say you don't get two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15310)|
| 4:15:12| Raise your hand if you voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15312)|
| 4:15:14| One, two, three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15314)|
| 4:15:16| Motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15316)|
| 4:15:18| carries nine to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15318)|
| 4:15:20| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15320)|
| 4:15:22| It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15322)|
| 4:15:24| Perez, Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15324)|
| 4:15:26| Scott Smith, myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15326)|
| 4:15:28| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15328)|
| 4:15:30| Jim Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15330)|
| 4:15:34| I'd like to point out that Mr. Graff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15334)|
| 4:15:36| got beat again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15336)|
| 4:15:40| All right. Seeing no other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15340)|
| 4:15:42| for the commission, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15342)|
| 4:15:44| deem the meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15344)|
| 4:15:52| adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=15352)|
