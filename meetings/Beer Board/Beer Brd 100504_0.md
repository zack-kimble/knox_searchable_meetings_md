| 0:00:38| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| It's one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| The grill at Highlands Row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=44)|
| 0:00:48| If you'll come to the podium, please, and give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| My name is Chad Barger, and the address of the business is 4705 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=55)|
| 0:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| Officer Friels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=63)|
| 0:01:05| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| A copy of the sales tax registration, health department approval, fire prevention approval, and building inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=68)|
| 0:01:17| I move we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| Why don't you tell us a little bit about your restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Well, it's going to be a steak and seafood house in a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| It was originally a restaurant opened in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| And our goal is to try and make this a very local restaurant and make it Knoxville's restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| And one of the, I guess, the catchphrases is it's going to be a steak and seafood house with southern flair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| We've been fortunate to preserve a lot of the original structure, their original hardwood floors, original pine siding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| some of the original brick in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| And it's just, I mean, a beautiful, beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| And very excited to get open and serve as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| So when will you be opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| We are shooting for the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Can't help but ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| What happens to a seafood side of your business with the Louisiana coast disappearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| I'm telling you, it's scary right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| We don't know really what's going to happen with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| One of our goals with seafood is to try and take a more kind of a regional approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| Catfish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Yeah, it could be catfish and tilapia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I mean, I think I heard 30 percent of all the seafood that is available is from that region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| So it could really be a hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Yeah, it's going to really drive the price up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| And we'll be looking at Pacific and Hawaiian options, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| And good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Is there any other business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| If not, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd100504?start=189)|
