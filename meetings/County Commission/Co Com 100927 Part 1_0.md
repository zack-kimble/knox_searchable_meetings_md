| 0:00:05| First thing we'd like to do is have the Pledge to the Flag, and Commissioner Andrews, if you'd lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| Will stand. Salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=10)|
| 0:00:20| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=20)|
| 0:00:31| You have the minutes from the last beer board meeting. Do I hear a motion that we approve those minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| Motion to approve. Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=36)|
| 0:00:40| They are approved. Before we get into the swearing in, oh, pardon me, we need to get a roll call of our folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| This is one of several mistakes I'll be making today. So, clerk, if you would call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| Commissioner McKenzie? Here. Commissioner Boyles? Here. Commissioner Norman? Here. Commissioner Owenby? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=51)|
| 0:00:59| Commissioner Briggs? Here. Commissioner Anders? Here. Commissioner Smith? Here. Commissioner Wright? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| Commissioner Brown? Here. Commissioner Hammond? Here. Commissioner Shouse? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=65)|
| 0:01:13| Before we swear in the individuals who are going to testify today, we have a representative from the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| Are you here? Yes. If you would like to come forward and explain to us what you have for any individuals who might want your materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| I'd like to give you the opportunity to do that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=84)|
| 0:01:38| Good afternoon, everyone. I'm here from the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| And we have partnered with Top Shelf Responsible Beverage Service to provide DVD training tool kits for all businesses in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=101)|
| 0:01:50| who serve alcohol. And these we are providing free of charge for anyone who requests them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| And here's the kit right here. And we'll be sitting in the back corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| So if anyone would like one on their way out, they can stop by and pick one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| Kim Pouncey from Top Shelf is here today. And I'll let her explain a little bit more about these tool kits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| The tool kits themselves are kind of a complete training system for a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| They come with an instructor manual for the manager or whoever will be doing the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| The DVD. A workbook for the employee to fill in the blanks while they're looking over the DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| An exam for each employee as well as a policy sheet that they must sign an initial saying that they have completed this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| They understand what company policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| And they also understand what all of the state and local regulations are that govern them as far as carding and checking IDs and selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| It also includes all the tools. We have ID coders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| We have the ID checking guide that has all of the licenses in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| There's a poster to post in the back that reminds them exactly what it is they're supposed to check for the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| So it's not only a complete training kit, but it's also all of the tools they need in which to implement carding intelligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:15| And this is free of charge for anyone that wants it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Yes, through the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Great. Thank you. Could I have your name and address for the record, please, both of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| I'm Kim Pouncey. Our business is at 1545 Western Avenue and that's in Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:35| I'm Heather Sutton with the Metropolitan Drug Commission. Our business address is 4930 Lyons View Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:45| Thank you. Mr. Law Director, if you would swear in any individuals who plan to testify today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Will everyone present who intends to give testimony before this committee, either because you're here on a violation or you're here to apply for a beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=231)|
| 0:04:00| please stand, raise your right hand and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| We solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you'll give here today will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| Thank you. Mr. Chairman, those present have been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| Clerk, item 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| Consideration of suspension revocation for the beer permit for the following establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Jesse's Market and Deli, 3403 Miller Road, Jerry Swearingen, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| I'm Alan Wolfie May, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| I own 72110, conducted an underage beer sting at Jesse's Market and Deli, 3403 Miller Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=282)|
| 0:04:52| And my underage person bought a six pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| Is the owner or representative here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| Please state your name and business address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Jerry Swearingen, 3403 Miller Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| Did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Do you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| I wasn't present, so I don't know, but I have to take his word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| You don't have any counter testimony or anything else to tell this commission regarding the matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| I don't think the Sheriff's Department has a reason to lie about it, so we'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| All right, commissioners, I'm going to defer to the commission as to penalty, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| Commissioners, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| You seem to have kind of a nonchalant attitude about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Did you not investigate what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I'm annoyed to the fact that we sold to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| To be honest with you, the whole situation really annoys me because I debated on whether to put beer in in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| The fact that we sold to a minor makes me wonder or not whether I have the right people in place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| So I'm reevaluating the ability to sell beer or not, whether or not I even want to deal with it, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| So it's not nonchalant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| I'm just really considering just taking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Was this a new employee or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| Well, we were open less than two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| I had just, as an owner, I put her through the beer class the week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| I tried to take all the steps that I could to prevent this from happening, and it still happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| And, you know, I went through the beer class myself, sent her before she started her first day through the beer class as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| And other than personally being there, I took every step I could to prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| So that being said, this seems to be a hot spot for this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| And I'm not so sure that I want to continue to have this kind of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| I'd like to make a motion for a $500 penalty or a 30-day suspension at the discretion of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| That will be your choice, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| You can either pay a fine of $500 or have your license suspended for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| If it's okay with the board, I'll take the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| That will give me 30 days without beer sales to evaluate and see how it impacts my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| And if it doesn't, then I can probably take that out at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| That's kind of where I'm leaning to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| That will start today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Obviously, no one is going to follow you to your business, but you want to see sales today for the next 30 calendar days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| Well, in anticipation, I haven't had a beer truck leave me product in over a week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| So I kind of anticipated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| So that's kind of where I'm at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| I'm in total agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| The kit that the Metropolitan Drug Commission has, you might want to pick one of those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| It might help you make a decision which way you want to go, if it's something you think you can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| There's something else that is available that's a little expensive that might help keep that from happening, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| We're going to hear about it a little later on today, I hope, if it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| But those kits might help you make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| Yes, and coming before you now, I've kind of gave this some thought over the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| I have a senior in high school myself, and I wouldn't be very happy with any establishment that sold him alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| So I'm just making that hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| I appreciate the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Well, you know, we're pretty, in my opinion, in the two years that I've been on, we've been pretty stern with folks who are violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=534)|
| 0:09:04| But I actually like your attitude toward this, and I commend you for looking at your process and doing a clear evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| This is the first time I've, one, I've heard someone take the 30 days, and I like the reason that you're taking the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| It's not that you're being cheap or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| I think you're going to go back and take an honest look at your particular setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| So thank you for being that conscientious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| Clerk, item 5B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| 5B, Midway IGA, 7345 Tazewell Pike, Dale Allen Longmire, owner, third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| Would you please state for the record the dates of the previous offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| Mr. Longmire appeared before the beer board in March 2009 and November 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=589)|
| 0:09:59| Wolfie, please address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| On August 25, 2010, we conducted an underage beer sting at Midway IGA, 3345 Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:13| and my underage bought six pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:21| Is there a representative here from the organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Sir, please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| Longmire, 7345 Tazewell Pike, Corrington, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| You heard the testimony of the officer, did you not, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Do you admit the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=638)|

| 0:10:41| and you wanted to address the commission as to any remedial steps you're taking or attempting to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| Yes, I know we've had several offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| We've tried different things over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| First of all, our gentleman that did sell this beer did attend the Top Shelf Program just about two or three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=653)|
| 0:11:02| We do have a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| And not all of our cashiers are authorized to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| When the beer sales come up, one of the authorized cashiers is there to make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| We have purchase registers where you type in the birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| But if you don't type in the right birthday, it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| And we've actually sent in some young people ourselves to try them out, which has worked in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| but it didn't work this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| And our latest thing that we have purchased is our ID, driver's license readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:41| We just got these in just two or three days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| So they're fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| We're hoping that this does solve our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| We want to do anything we can to correct this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| You insert the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| It reads that the gentleman or whoever purchased names comes up, tells their age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| And at the bottom, there's two lights, one where you get green or red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| This also does for tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| If they're under 18, a little red X will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| If they're under 21, there will be a green X for tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| And under alcohol sales, there will be a red X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| So this is our latest attempt to correct this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| I know we've had problems in the past, but we've always tried to do whatever we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| First, I need to make a little bit of disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| This location is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| I have occasionally shopped for groceries at this IGA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I have talked to a co-owner of the establishment, Mr. Joe Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| I have not spoken to Dale about this offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| And in light of the actions that they're taking trying to rectify underage beer sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| I'd move that they be suspended or fined according to the third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=787)|
| 0:13:15| based on whatever our current schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| That would be how much, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| That would be a 90-day suspension or a $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Now, again, you know, the commission has discretion in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| So this scale that you have, of course, is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| I'd like the stipulation that if he comes back, he doesn't get a barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| If he comes back, it's no more fines, it's suspensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| If we can specify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| I guess that's taken away from future commissions, but I won't vote for another suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I'll vote for another fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| I'll vote for your suspension or revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Just a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Mr. Longmire, do you know, are these units in use anywhere else in Knox County right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| Where we saw the unit was on a TV on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| There was a bar on Cumberland Avenue that has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| The gentleman behind you is raising his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Is that the one you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| Evidently, since you're up here, you've not been successful with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| I'll take that one back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| This is a lot of money for those machines, and, you know, you've got a discount for buying it online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| but it's a $1,295 machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Not everybody can afford to do that, but I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| We want to try anything we can to avoid this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| And based on that, you know, I would have a tendency to say, okay, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| we'll go with the fine and not, because we could do this, you know, take away the license this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| but I think the suspension or the fine right now would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| You know, I've read your e-mail and I guess I commend all of the administrative measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=915)|
| 0:15:25| that you put in to try to ensure that this doesn't happen, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| and I'm not trying to talk down to you or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| but there is a difference between, you know, errors, mistakes, and willful acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| I think you have a lot of measures, and this is the latest in the line of a lot of measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| You know, the state has measures that they put in and orientation and bars and things on the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| You know, I think you're dealing with some willful acts here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and I'm not suggesting that you take any, you know, drastic measures and go firing folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| but I do think you're going to have to get, you know, to that root as to why this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| Three, since March of 2009, it's excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| But I do balance that with what you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| and that's why I'm going to support Commissioner Wright's recommendation or motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| However, I'm with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| If we see you again in a long time, I'm voting for revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| All the employees that did sell were terminated on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| So that's, they know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| All employees know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| I was wondering, it seems like we don't get a lot of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| And by the way, I either got your phone call or someone's phone call about this, you know, also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| and I've read your e-mail and, you know, I appreciate receiving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| I know you're making every effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| But I was wondering, what do some of the larger stores do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| You know, the Kroger's and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| It seems like we just don't see them come in with a lot of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| They have measures in place that negatively impact the manager financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| and also they have self-checks where they send people in on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| And so that's why you don't see a whole lot of pilot and waggles and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| I mean, they're going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| But Kroger, I know for a fact, hires teenagers to come in and try to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| and fires their employees when they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| So they know there's implications for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| Yeah, I was wondering why we just don't see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I guess this device that you've bought, it would actually take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| it really would take a willful act for them to be selling alcohol to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| If the red light shows up, then there's no question I misread the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| the nine for an eight or eight for a nine or something on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| Not putting, not entering in the wrong birthday in the register itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| So this is, it seems to me it's a foolproof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Well, I'm going to support Wright's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| I know it's hard as a business owner to try to get people to do what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| But likewise, you know, we just have a low tolerance if we happen to have a fourth one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| in a very short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| So we'll see how this device works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Motion on the floor is a 90-day suspension or a $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Commissioner, it's up to you as to which one you would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| We'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I'd also like to thank Mr. Minor for his trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| He's worked with us quite a bit on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| So I also want to thank him for all his time and trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| Clerk, item 5C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Mr. Longmire, the young lady over in the corner, Heather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| and would you get with them before you leave so that they can take a look at your machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Item 5C, town, country, 8418 Rutledge Pike, Calvin Green owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:14| On 8-25-2010, sent my underage into town and country, 8418 Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| and they bought a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| I believe the first offense on this was March 09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Please state your name for the record, your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Calvin Green, 8418 Rutledge Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| Sir, did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Do you admit the facts as stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| The employee that sold it, she had worked there about a year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| and I terminated her on the spot whenever it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Commissioners, questions, or do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| I move that they be fined or suspended their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| For a 60-day offense, or rather for a second offense, that would be a 60-day suspension or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1219)|

| 0:20:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| You have a 60-day suspension or $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| What's your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I'll do the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| That will be within seven days paid to the county clerk, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| Item 5D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1236)|

| 0:21:01| Please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| It's Kareem Bogani, 8920 Maynardville Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Sir, did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| And do you agree with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| I know you were speaking from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| We couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Actually, when he asked about that machine, that if anyone else had seen it, you know, I have one of those, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| Like, I purchased one from my location after this underage sale happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| So, you know, that's why I was letting him know that, yeah, I have one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| And just for the record, you know, I've got a couple letters here that we've been tried before on the underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| and we passed all the time, you know, but this time we got unlucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| We'll make sure it don't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| When you do a sting and the owner or the clerk does what they're supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| do you come back in and let them know that they've passed a sting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Yeah, we actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| No, not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Not you, but I was talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| That's the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| You all get a letter that they did things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| This is the previous letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| On all of the underage sales, of course, I get a citation if they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| If they comply with the law, they get a letter from the sheriff thanking them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| and we also put in there who the employee was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| We get their name, that checked ID and did not sell so that the owners would know who we checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| What are the dates of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Are they dated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| What are the dates of those two letters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| August 26, 2009, November 6, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Does the commission wish to see those letters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| My first question was would you buy this machine before or after, but you answered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| This employee that sold this time, was this employee one of those that had been tested before in one of the letters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Actually, we had hired him like two, three weeks ago, and he was scheduled for the training, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| So he has attended the TRIPS training that they do at the county, but that was after he was busted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:42| After he sold the beer to the underage, we got the machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| He's already been to the training, and he actually got citation for 1129 probation or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:57| So he's learned his lesson loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I'm pretty sure he won't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| So you're going to trust him and keep him on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Honestly, in this day and age, I don't want to fire him and make him lose his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| He won't get a job anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| I can find people to work for me, but it would be kind of hard for him to find another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| And I believe everyone makes mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| All men make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Only fools repeat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Hopefully he's not a fool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| But I didn't fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| No, I did not fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| He's still working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I make a motion for a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Sir, you have a $500 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| What's your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| A $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Muhammad A. Sadiq, raceway number 6759, 9002 Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| off-premises, formerly raceway number 6759.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Sir, please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Muhammad A. Sadiq, 9002 Oak Ridge Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| Sir, I'm going to ask you questions about your beer application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| You'll have to answer out loud for each question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| I'm not, but I don't know about my employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| Who's going to be selling beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| My employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Myself and my employee, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| So you have an employee, but you don't know whether or not they've had any criminal past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| We never check the background of the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| We just get the reference, and I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| Could I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Wolfie, would you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| What assistance, if any, is provided to these individuals relative to the background checks of prospective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| or current employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| If they're listed on the application, their name and date of birth, enough where we can run them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| then we run all of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| Do we know if the do you have a copy of his application here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Let's pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| There's no one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Sir, at this point, the only name on your application is your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| That means you'd be the only one who can sell beer until we know who these other people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| and a background check can be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| I'll give them all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| We could either defer this for 30 days, or in the alternative, you can issue the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| with the understanding that only this individual is the one that can legally sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| Mr. Director, would he have to come back or just provide UK with background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| Well, yeah, I mean, law enforcement would have to be afforded the opportunity to conduct them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| so they would probably go to Mr. Mays to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| So anybody that's, he could get the beer permit today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| and then anybody else that has business beer transactions would have to be approved by the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Do you have something, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| If he will give us a list of the employees, we can do the background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| and then if you want to approve it with an amendment pending that we get the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| and everything checks out okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| That's certainly within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Well, we can move on through the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| I have a couple of employees that have all the beer from the top shelf and from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| Okay, sir, well, we're going to need to know who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1704)|

| 0:30:25| We just had one, and I think the owner came in and asked you all not to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| It's been on our agenda three or four times in the last six or eight months about doing some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1835)|

| 0:32:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=1940)|

| 0:35:04| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| A business license to have a registration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| So has beer been served here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| And this is going to be for on-premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Essentially a bar and grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| A restaurant, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| And does anybody else have an interest in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| And who would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Harold J. Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Are you familiar with the beer laws of Knox County in Tennessee, and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| When do you intend to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| I guess after the meeting we plan on lining somebody up to come by and train the whole restaurant in a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Again, the Sheriff's Department can assist you in that endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| And the Fire Marshal isn't present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| So essentially we're in a situation where we don't have any trained service as of yet that I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| James, you're the current owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I own half of it, and so does Mr. Patrick owns the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| And is Joe still going to stay there with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Make a motion to approve pending server training course and Fire Marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| We have two discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Discuss what action the commission deems appropriate regarding dormant beer applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| What you have, Commissioners, is that some entities will apply for a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| and then either for some reason construction is delayed and then a period of not merely months but years goes by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| and the clerk has showed some concern about these pending permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| So the issue is whether or not the commission wants to put essentially an expiration date for entities of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:09| You know, someone comes in and applies, five years goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| We don't, you know, in terms of binding future boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| but just in terms of the character and change, things can happen during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| For instance, you can have an encroachment of an agricultural zone or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| So we were wondering whether or not you wanted to put a time restraint that, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| just arbitrarily, you know, a permit will be valid for one year from application or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| We could amend the ordinance to reflect that, but we'll defer to the commission's wisdom in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| I'm concerned about this also in that at the application for a beer permit, there's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Is there an annual fee to continue the renewal of a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| And I think I remember sometime in the last two and a half years there being an issue raised over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| and it was, as I heard it at that time, the continued renewal of the beer permit would be paid $100 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| whether it's active or still pending construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Okay, then that needs to be spread across the board to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| In my opinion, whether or not there's an encroachment of agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| or something else changes in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I don't know that there would be something that would drive a beer permit away from an existing establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| So once we approve the beer permit and they keep the permit valid with a $100 a year payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| then I would look forward to it being a valid permit whether they're serving any or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| We are in hard or difficult financial times, and the construction of some places may be on hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| but the issue of the beer permit for that particular location has been settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| So that's my thought on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Now, if we need a motion to say that everyone pays a, and I believe there's a list of inactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:20| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| What's that say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| It says pending beer permits, but this list is not of pending beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| It's a list of valid permits that are not serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| No, these haven't been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Those are places that have been approved pending construction that we have on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:46| but they do not pay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| We need to turn that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| They need to be paying their $100 a year just like anyone that's serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| or else they need to surrender their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| But you see what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| I'm just talking in the generic term of if they've been here, they've applied, we've approved them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| they need to be paying the $100 a year deal to keep the thing valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| If they don't want to pay the $100 a year, then it needs not to be a pending or an approved permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| My question is along the same line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I just wanted to be sure that they're not paying that $100 until the final approval of that permit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:34| So I would agree with Commissioner Wright here to my right that once it's past this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:49| we have paperwork and time involved in keeping these things in the system until they do get taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| and be looked after and so forth, that once it's passed and gets to this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| they need to be paying that $100 just like anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| because basically they were approved based on waiting for construction to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:16| or a fire department survey or whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Madam Clerk, does everybody pay $100 a year for a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| They do pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Everyone that has a valid beer permit does pay $100 per year privilege tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| but those are only people that have an active permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| There's not a provision for someone that has a pending permit from a year or two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| or whatever time frame we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| I would like to ask the law director to research the legality of charging on a pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| and if he can report back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Is that agreeable with the commission to have him look at it and bring it back to us next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Different subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Well, yes, I have a question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I'd also like to get an understanding before we act on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| what are the costs associated with having this action that we took that wasn't acted on by the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:25| what the annual cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I don't want to charge people things just for charging them something just because they didn't act on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| if it's not going to cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| If there are costs associated with it, then I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| You know, just to, I don't want to be punitive just to be punitive, if you know what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| So the law director will research this and come back to us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Item 7B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Discuss what action the commission deems appropriate regarding beer permittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| who extend their property into an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| As you were, commissioners, your code reads that generally you can't get a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| if you're within 500 feet of an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| It's my understanding that there are some entities that when they receive the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| they're certainly within the parameters of the 500-foot rule, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| But then ultimately they start expanding the business to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| where they're actually encroaching into the 500-foot zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Now generally what would occur then is they have really two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| One, stop the construction, or in the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| attempt to get a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| And apparently there has been some complaints about businesses doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| It's a simple remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| They're put on notice that they have to go before the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| and attempt to get a variance, or in the alternative, they have to cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| Do we need any action or any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Well, I mean, I believe you're certainly empowered just to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| once this is brought to our attention and we verify the facts, we send them a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| And if they do not comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| then you can summon them before the beer board to give cause why their license should not be suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| or revoked for failing to comply with established precedent and law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| But the problem comes up in some of these cases where the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| the actual building itself may be 500 feet from agricultural property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| but if they come along and fence in the backyard and put picnic tables and karaoke machines and all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| suddenly it's not 500 feet anymore, it's 400 feet or 380 or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Well, I gave you a memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Interestingly, the Tennessee Code doesn't actually get into that kind of finite dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| What it does read, however, that all decks, patios and other serving areas that are contiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| in other words, attached to or part of the exterior of the building which the business is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| beer permit already covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| So ostensibly, if someone has a backyard and they have a horseshoe pit and they decide to extend a deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| the issue is going to be whether or not that does comport with the Tennessee Code and your own code that does permit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| Whether or not, you know, extending it to the agricultural zone is a preexisting license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| I don't know if this is an endemic problem as such that it's, again, injurious to the health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| welfare and safety of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| We'd have to look them at a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| But, you know, you essentially have enough enforcement powers at this point not to try to amend your code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| to accommodate for these oddities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| We are adjourned for the beer board session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| We will come back into session at 2 o'clock for our monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2746)|

| 0:46:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Commissioner Strauss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Our devotional will be by Commissioner Dave Wright, and then immediately after the devotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| we will have the Pledge of Allegiance from Commissioner Jeff Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| Commissioner Broyles, you know it's important when I stand down here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2812)|
| 0:47:02| This is of importance to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| And first, I would like to say that I address the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| I was going to say the mayor, but he may not be with us, or if he is, he's not down where I can see him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| and my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| I'm very excited to stand here before you today on this first day of new commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:28| I was reminded just yesterday by the news media of why we're here, and that's to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:37| My two-and-a-half years on commission seem both short and long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| Short in that we have acted on some important issues, and long in that we have sat through a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:53| Earlier this month, we stood right here, and as individuals swore on a book that we would uphold the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2873)|
| 0:48:08| Today, I open that same book and turn to the fourth chapter of Acts of the Apostles, to verse 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:20| Now, the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and one soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:30| And I do that to point out on this first day of our new commission, we are here to share our knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| our skills, and our abilities to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| I invoke the blessing of our Heavenly Father, and pray we be filled with grace. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you. Commissioner Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| Everyone stand, face the flag and salute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| Let me say to those who are present and to those who may be watching on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| that this is the first meeting where we have the reduced number from 19 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| We have not had our intergovernmental and finance meetings. We've had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| So as we go through this agenda, this is going to be new for us. It will be new for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| We will be making some mistakes as we go along, and I just ask that you bear with me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| But I believe that we've done some really good work in our workshop, and you will see that reflected in our agenda here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| Let me also say that in looking at our agenda, we have reports of officials and reports of county agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| Now since I've been on commission, we've never had these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| And so a couple of the officeholders called and said, do I need to be prepared to give you a report today, a quarterly report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| And I said, no. And they said, well, it's on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| I'm going to be working with our law director and at our workshop next month be providing you with some suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| on how we can revise this agenda to make it more accurately reflect what we do here in our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| as well as some ideas on how we might be able to improve the flow of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| So I will be presenting that to you in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Let's go now to amendments to the agenda. Do we have any amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Yes, Ms. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Dr. Buchanan, Director of Health Department 140 Damron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| I've been asked by Cherokee Health for a 30-day deferral on the pediatric contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| so that they may appropriately address the concerns of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| So to defer the contract for pediatrics for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| So it would be to defer for 30 days. Any objections to that, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| What is the number on that one? The resolution number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| I apologize, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Resolution 601, we're asking that be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| Question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Yes, Commissioner Norman, I recognize him first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| I just have some removals from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Okay, anything on this item? Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Yes, Dr. Buchanan, thank you for coming and bringing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| I would enjoy talking with you out there just real quickly and some of the ideas that you came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| So I'd be anxious to hear. I'd like to meet with him if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| And they're happy to meet with any one of the commissioners who would like to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Suggest that they come to the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| They were here at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Yes, we will defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| We have some people from Habitat here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| It's item 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Okay, and then one other for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| We had Mr. Ammons, I believe, that was to speak about billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| And so I was just wondering if we would go ahead and remove that item from consent 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| And he could speak to that if he's here at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| Is that all right with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| We will do that, remove that from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Also, you're asking that 102 be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| And I'd like to ask that 101 be removed from consent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| If not, do I hear a motion that everything needs to be added, added, and deleted, deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| I make the Craig Leuthold amendment that everything be added, everything be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| everything be everythinged, and I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| We have the education consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| So, clerk, if you would read the education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3170)|

| 1:04:07| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Resolution 111 was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| We'll go to Resolution 112, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| confirming the appointment of, as the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| a violation associated with ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| Commissioners, I believe that the mayor's office has not yet been afforded the opportunity to actually appoint someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| They would ask to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| If in the interim we do have an emergency, we can certainly temporarily appoint an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| But we haven't had any need for one in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| I would so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| It is deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| I'd like to go back to the two honorariums, if I could, before we get into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| If we could go to item number 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:06| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| honoring Vicki Carter for earning the Catastrophic Mapping Specialist Designation Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| Do I hear a motion that we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| I'd like to wait for her to come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| And I believe Keith, I saw you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| And Dick Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| What we want to do today is that Vicki Carter here has achieved a significant honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:51| A lot of people don't know really what goes on in the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| They have their ideals, but there's a lot of things that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| And what Vicki has accomplished by getting her CMS, and as you can read here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| that's Cadastral Mapping Specialist, that's taken a long time and a course of hard study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| Also with that, they presented her with her Tennessee Master Assessors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| down at the property assessor's main meeting here just a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| and that's signed by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| And she is really special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| One thing that our department does, and I believe Keith agreed with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| we do the first two layers of the KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| And there are just so many things that evolves out of this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| And we have offered from you all from time to time special mapping things in districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| You know, we can do fire district, school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| We can do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| We've done something for Dave Wright today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Some others have asked many things of us, which we're always glad to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| But the lady behind the scenes on that is Miss Vicki Carter here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| and we'd like to present her to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| And this is also the highest level that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| That's a member of the IAAO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| There's very few internationally that has received this prestigious award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:23| So we're presenting it to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| Do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| I do want to thank Knox County for allowing me to have this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| And thank you for achieving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| I also understand, Mr. Ballard, that you have achieved something I'm hearing through the grapevine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| Would you share that with us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| Well, you know, I look at one of my jobs, one of my roles is with Turn Limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| to turn over the most trained staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| And this is going to happen every four years, eight years, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| And we were sort of left with the educational void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| But I've not asked them to do anything that I've not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| And I have received my first level of certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| And I've asked a few of the others to come in here because, you know, that was a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| That was a big issue for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| And it didn't go unnoticed by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| And you would take somewhere like Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| They have eight master assessors and six certified assessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| Shelby County has 15 and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| But to give you a little idea of what we've started, there's two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| You've got your realty side and you've got your comptroller side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| And if you'll just let me introduce, I've asked them to come down here today so that you all can be proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| and know that we're headed in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| And this is not to say ones that are not certified at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Again, their experience, their backbone, their history, and we've really got a good group to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| But on the real estate side, we have Stuart Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| Just go ahead and stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Stuart Blackstock, Doug Russell, Heather Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| She's going to be a mother in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| She couldn't be with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Linda Turner has hers, but it's in retirement because she retired from the banking, First Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| And then something that we have pretty special in that we have Jim Weaver sitting back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:32| and that the state only has seven of the highest levels, CAE level five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| and the whole state working for county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| We have two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| But then they're even a little bit more independent than the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| Jim also has achieved his AAS, which is the inside operations level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:55| And I can't say that it's more prestigious than the CAE, but it makes him very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| He is the only one in county government that has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| Dean Lewis, if Dean will stand up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| He's sort of a master of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| He's received his level five highest level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| But then what makes him just a little bit unusual, on the real estate side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| he is certified general, which is the highest that you can receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| He's qualified in 19 counties as an expert witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| He handled the state appeals for 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| And he's our key guy on the computer conversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| which will pay dividends for Knox County not too long down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| Along with me on the level one certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| Mr. Theresa Dalton, Roger Owenby, Scott McFetridge, Jordan Taylor, if Jordan's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:51| Andy Keeler, if he's here, has received his level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| Of course, Vicky again, that's the highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| If we get the top level in personal property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| we'll have everybody's covered with the highest level of certification that you can have in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| We were left with a void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| We have right now, currently, in Knox County history, more certified, more on the real estate side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:18| and more CAEs and all the rest of this field that goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| We've taken this serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| We've got an education plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| And these people I give to you, we've got eight people in the mapping class next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:34| If you dislike me as these people that's taken one, that's 90 state hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| And then you've got to take a comprehensive test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| This is not continuing education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| It's real hard stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| And it's going to make us a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| And I thank you all a lot prouder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Thank you, Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| Clerk, item 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring the Knoxville Habitat of Humanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| upon the occasion of its 25th anniversary and declaring October 1st as Knoxville Habitat for Humanity Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| I probably shouldn't be the one down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| I think Mike Brown would probably be more appropriate with his experience with Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| I've never built a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| I'm pretty good at tearing stuff down, but I'm not too good at building it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| But anyway, I hope this is certainly a great asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| Most everybody knows about Knoxville Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| I wasn't aware of the 400 houses, the total 1,400 individuals that they've helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| I can't imagine the positive effect on families that this organization has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| So it is my honor and our honor to honor this fine community-oriented organization, and I hope you'll do so also with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| This is Archie Ellis and Greg McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Some of you all know Archie from KTSC, and I think that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| We know each other from West High School and all kinds of other dubious activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| So that's the reason why you asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:36| Tony, that's the reason I missed the workshop last week during my 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:46| And thank you, Commissioner Brown, for your interest in Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| On public forum, Commissioners, what I'd like to do is Mr. Ammons, I believe, is going to speak at the billboard moratorium resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:57| Mr. Nichols is standing by to talk about the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| I'd like to address that immediately after Brian Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| If Mr. Testament is here and would like to address us now on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| And those are the ones that we have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:18| Mr. Testament, if you could give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| My name is Brian Testament, 8601 Dunair Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| What I'd like to discuss with you all today is planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| an amendment I would like to recommend that we've had trouble with for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| I've been developing and building in Knoxville for about 46 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| And it involves swimming pools only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| It's a very small portion of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| For 25 years, every time there's been a pool built in a peripheral setback zone, we've had to get a waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4493)|
| 1:15:03| And it's never been a problem at all for the past 25 years up until the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| where the new board and county attorney has decided that you can't build a pool within this peripheral setback zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:22| But there's nothing in the ordinance that says you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| Never has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| And that's by all the past administrations, all the zoning appeal boards, the building inspector's office, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:39| And what it does, it denies these people any use of their property at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| They can't use their backyard for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| This day and age, all your houses are basically the lots are 125 foot deep on 95% or more of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:54| And your houses are basically 59 foot deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| That's what from the front porch to the rear end screen porch, it's 59 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| You can't set the house back to the very minimum, which you can't set every house 20 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| That puts you 80 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| And then 35 foot puts you at 115 foot, so you have less than 10 foot of backyard that you can even use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:18| So they've always allowed waivers on these pools so people would have the right to use their backyard for a small residential pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:28| And the neighborhood behind me, which is zoned RA, they don't even have to have but a 25 foot backyard, no setback at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| Just a 25 foot backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| And they can build the swimming pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| They can put unattached garages with apartments in them 10 foot from the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:51| They can use a utility building and put it within five foot of the line with no problem right back behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| And that's an RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| And it's gotten impossible for these people, for us to sell these houses to these people where they can't use this backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| And the only thing it says in the zoning ordinance at all about it is it mentions structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:19| Well, it doesn't ever give the definition of what the structure is, but in everything it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| it says at one point that the zoning setback can be adjusted according to the height of the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| Well, there's no height to a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| It's underground, so it can't be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| It certainly can't be that situation as far as being able to fix that to a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:47| But they've always allowed these pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| And nowadays, we've sold these houses to these people and they can't get a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| And, of course, they're upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| And, you know, it's possibly our fault, too, as the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| But, I mean, surely they have a right to use more than 10 foot of their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| And I think this needs to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| It has been needed for 25 years, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| Everybody just went up there and got the zoning appeals board to give them a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| And there was no problem ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| I don't know of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| I talked to Campbell Pools, Coya Pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| They never had one turned down in 25 years either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| And all at once they just arbitrarily started turning them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| And there's nothing that I can read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| I'd like to read one thing to you that they're basing it says on variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| The purpose of a variance is to modify the strict application of specific requirements of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, or shallow or steep lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| or other exceptional physical conditions whereby such strict application would result in a practical difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4735)|
| 1:19:05| or unnecessary hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| Well, I mean, you know, when you deprive a man of the use of his backyard, that's unreasonable, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| And the homeowners all think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| And they're upset and not being able to use their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| And the R.A. is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| They can do anything they want to, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| And we're not asking for anything but the pool to be allowed, you know, people to be allowed to build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| because the other lots in development, they all can have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| There's no problem about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| And then you've got a third that can't and two-thirds that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| And that makes it a tremendous hardship selling these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| And in this market, it's hard enough without some sort of hardship like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| And I would really appreciate you all putting that under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| Mr. Law Director, is this something that you could take a look at and report back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Or work with the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Certainly, we can take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| I do know that this gentleman did come before the MPC and rather the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| and I believe that was denied and he does have a right to appeal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| But in future use, we can certainly take a look at this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Can you do it in 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| We will have it at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| I'd like to move now to item number 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:43| On page 11, resolution 904,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| requesting that the Knox County Criminal Justice Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| in conjunction with the Helen Rosman Knapp Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| exhaustively study all available potential funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| public-private partnerships, and intergovernmental partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| between the county, city, state, and federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| for the purpose of creating a public safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| and report their findings accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| General Nichols, you had signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| but I'd like to give you the opportunity to speak now if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:21| Randall E. Nichols, 8601 Delmere, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| I don't want to get too far in front, Mr. Chairman, on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| and to put my views before views of members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| that will be called on to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| So I would defer my time now if you think it would be better suited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| if you needed to hear from me a little bit later on in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| I would be pleased to defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| Sure. Thank you, sir. We'll do that. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| I wanted to make some comments about this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| and eventually I'll make a motion for it to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| because at our workshop we had a consultant that felt that the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| the CDBG loan that we would be making an application to would be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| because you cannot use those funds as a jail diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| Now, where I disagree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| and of course the ultimate arbitrator of this will be HUD itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| but this is not a jail diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| What this is, this is developing and establishing a center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| where people that have diseases can be taken for treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| And I'd like to remind everyone that the American Psychiatric Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| publishes a book every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| It's called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| And in that handbook that they issue every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| alcoholism, drug addiction, and mental illnesses are described as illnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| that need to be treated just like we treat diabetes, strokes, and heart disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| Diseases are not crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| And the purpose of the safety center is to take people who have recognized diseases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| and illnesses to a place where they can receive treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| It's no more a jail diversion program than the 10-year plan to end homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| is a jail diversion program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| or people that pass out due to an unintentional overdose of insulin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| or someone that has a stroke that's driving an automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| is taken to a hospital rather than jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| They're taken to the appropriate place to receive their illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| There are secondary benefits to having a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| First of all, the patients, because they're taken to the appropriate place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| to treat their illness, they don't lose their TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| If you're arrested and taken to jail, you lose your TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| Secondly, they are offered the opportunity to receive treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| that will address the problems of their illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| and potentially allow them to return to productive lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| It's also a manner to keep people who don't need to be in our emergency rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| to be taken to the safety center for much more appropriate treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| than can be even given in the emergency rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| And then finally, finally, as a secondary benefit of the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| it helps to relieve jail overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| And we know what those expenses are if we don't address those problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| is that at some point we're going to have to build a new pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| It's probably going to be sooner rather than later if we don't address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Last year we looked at, and that's probably in these days and times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| it's going to cost about $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| The other potential solution to the problem is to have an intake center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| that we looked at last year that we thought was going to cost about $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| We know we have these expenses where we have transportation officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| in the sheriff's department that have to take these prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| I believe there's 12 officers all together that are just involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| in transporting patients back and forth between Maloneyville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| and the judicial system downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| There's maintenance costs to their automobiles, the expenses of gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| And these are some of the reasons that we really need to approve the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| not as a jail diversion program, but as a method of treating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| in our community, people that have illnesses that are well described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| Our resolution, as it was just read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| states that we are to exhaustively study all available slash potential funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| public-private partnerships, intergovernmental partnerships between the city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| federal, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| What this resolution does gives us just another opportunity to exhaustively study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| potential sources of revenue to finance the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| This application, if we go ahead and vote today to have them to submit the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| we'll let HUD be the ultimate arbitrator as to whether there's validity to the application or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| This is not going to be a rapid overnight process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| This is going to take several months for HUD to review this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| And I want to remind everyone that even if HUD does accept the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| we are not obligated to take those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| In the meantime, we can continue our exhaustive study to look at other sources of financing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| And if we find a better solution, and even the consultant said that he thought that this was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| in quotation marks, a brilliant idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| If we can find a better way to finance it, let's use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| But if we are going to exhaustively look at all the potential sources of financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5223)|
| 1:27:10| we do need to go ahead and pass this resolution today and submit the application to HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| and let them be the arbitrator as to whether the funds should be available to us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| This is actually a loan from CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| It also gives us time because some of those funds were going to be taken from other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| We can look to see if we have any other opportunities there to help some of the people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| that may need to get their roofs repaired or their furnaces fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| So I would strongly encourage the commission today to go ahead and pass the resolution as written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| to submit the application to HUD for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| And again, I'll remind everyone, even if the whole thing goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| we are not obligated to take the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| We can turn it down at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| And I'd like to make a motion to accept the resolution as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| Ms. Boyles was in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| I know her light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| You want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| I'm very much in favor of the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I've been on the task force that's been working to develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| And I think it's high time we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| And I think that our consultant was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| It is a brilliant idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I'm not particularly in favor of using 108 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| But, yeah, let's go ahead and send the application in and see what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| But I'm not going to be a bit surprised if they turn it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| because it is indeed, in fact, a jail diversion program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| and that's why it was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| So I don't think we need to start playing semantics games about that to try to get funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| I think that it is a jail diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| It's a brilliant jail diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| And hopefully we will be setting a new standard that other communities will follow in their areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:17| If the 108 loan doesn't come through, if it comes through, we can argue about it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| about whether to use it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| If it doesn't come through, and I doubt that it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| I think we need to start now looking at other ways to get this funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| It needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| We need to get behind it, and we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| And we need to exhaustively look at other means, because I think we're going to need them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| and I don't want to put it off for another minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| Let's get going on this and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| That's my belly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| My opinion is an extension of both what Dr. Briggs and Amy just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| and that is that it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| This is obviously a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| It's going to be beneficial to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| There's a couple of points that I'd like as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| The question, everything's about time and money, and for us to go forward with this as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:24| I'm wondering about the time, the staffing investment that's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| Does it have an effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Where is the effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Does it affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| I'm assuming there's no effect on Barbara Kelly and CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| We're going to be okay with that until this is all approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I mean, until we work the finances out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| The other issue, and this is the main one, is that this is all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| for those of us that have been involved on the issue in a tangential way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| and not on the committee, not on the Justice Committee, this is all very vaporous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| That is, we don't have any documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| I don't have anything in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| I've got a lot of words and discussion and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| And so I hope the study is comprehensive in a couple of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:22| One, that it does some comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| It shows comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| It goes to other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| I know it's a novel program, but there are other people that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| every metropolitan area in the United States struggles with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| So there are other models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| There are other things that possibly the study would document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| and address to give those of us that are not on the inside of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| a little comfort level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| And then the other side of that, which is also a part of the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| would possibly be something like a pilot program where we could really study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| and also investigate the funding mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| And so I think there's opportunities without building anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| in the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| We're talking about 12 beds, 12 Barker loungers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| There's some spaces where we can do some small versions of what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| And I think that would serve us also in the documentation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| So I hope that in the study aspect of it is truly a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| and we've got some things, some hard and fast things that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| I might address commission for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| I am in favor of this and will be voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| And I remember when this committee was appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and they became members of the already existent committee, the Justice Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| So this has been studied for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| This is not something that's just come about in the last 30 days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I got on the phone with Sheriff Jones, Ms. Rogers, Mr. Bivens on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| because I was interested in some figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| And a couple of interesting things came out of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| The first one was when we toured the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| we were told that there were 110 people that were in the mental health facility pod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| I believe Mr. Black and his staff at Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| identified out of that 110, 75, up to 75, would be eligible for a possible diversion for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| As Mr. Nichols said during our workshop session, we're paying for this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| Whether we do anything or not, we're still paying for 110 people in the pod at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| If 75 of these people could be potentially diverted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| and I'd hate to use the word diverted, but taken from that pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| you're looking at $190 a day, $150, $190 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| You just do the math. That's one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| The other thing is, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| the University of Tennessee pulled out a miraculous two-over-time victory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| and I'm sure that there were some people who celebrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| And for those folks who celebrated, they would be taken to the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| Under this plan, they would not be taken there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| They would be taken to the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| And they could be taken care of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| The other thing is the TennCare aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| Once they are taken to the detention facility, they lose TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Now there would be an opportunity to have those benefits possibly kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| The transportation costs, I was interested in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| and we've had the figure of $750,000 to a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| You can't realistically say that all million dollars would go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| because you're still going to have to take some folks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| But there would be savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| It's hard to quantify and put it to the penny, because you can't really do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| but as we've been told, we know there are going to be savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| It's just a matter of getting into it and figuring it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| The last thing is, after I talked with the Sheriff and Ms. Rogers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| in the back of my mind, I remembered meeting a very impressive woman in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| and I believe Mr. McKenzie and Ms. Brolls were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| when they did the presentation on the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Her name was Stephanie Baucus, and I thought, I've got her card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| And sure enough, I found it over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| She is from Athens, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| and she is the Associate Director of the Office of Intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| and Public Liaison for the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| I think that she might be a good contact for us to talk with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| to see about Department of Justice, other federal funding ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| because she said that since she's from here, she's very familiar with Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| would love to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| So I just put this in as another resource that we might be able to contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| as we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| So I wanted to bring out those remarks, and Commissioner Shouse, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| I don't think we have any option but to move forward with this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| If you're putting it on a balance sheet or income statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| or whatever accounting phrase we want to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| it doesn't necessarily compute as a tremendous savings for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| but I agree with General Nichols and the Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| there's got to be some savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| I mean, we're going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| The city is going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| The TennCare Factor is saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| And looking at the bottom line option, it looks like it's another pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| a $20 million pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| I looked at the numbers, and I think Dr. Briggs threw out $2.7 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| which is the debt service on a $20 million pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| I'm for reducing our debt and not running up our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| We talked about it briefly next door earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| So that pod has probably got to come about sooner or later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| but I'd much rather it be later, and I think this is a movement that can delay that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| I really don't want to beat this, and I'm going to take 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I know that we're looking at this as a jail diversion program, but what we really are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| I'm going to disagree, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| It's not just a jail diversion program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| It's treating people with recognized illnesses in an appropriate place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| and the jail is not the place to treat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| Our motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| The opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100927part1?start=5826)|
