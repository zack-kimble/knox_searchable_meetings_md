| 0:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Now it's time for my Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| Obviously, the topic of the last week or so has been this storm and wintry weather we've all been dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| So I'd like to start by thanking everyone who's pulled together in so many ways to help Knoxville get through this unprecedented weather event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| This was, I'm sure you've read, this was the longest lasting deep snow in Knoxville since recorded weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| You know, more than 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| So it was really unprecedented in modern times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And this was a huge amount of snow for our city, followed by many consecutive days of frigid temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| And it's so rare in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| And this led to many frustrations and many challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| But so many community members and city workers stepped up to meet the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| And I want to give shout outs to a few people that really roasted the challenge in a big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| First, our outreach workers from many different organizations and city folks who went into homeless camps in the days leading up to this cold spell and snowstorm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=256)|
| 0:04:27| and let our unhoused neighbors know about the warming centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| And speaking of warming centers, I want to give a huge shout out to Aaron Reid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| who through the new Joint Office of Housing Stability started organizing the warming centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| not the day before the storm, not the week before the storm, but starting back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| And those centers, which were not flawless and they had some challenges themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| but had they not been coordinated in advance and gotten stood up in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| who knows how much more challenging it would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| So those centers undoubtedly saved lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| And on the first night, they helped shelter about 120 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| And then after the first night, it was between 200 and 300 people each night after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| So this was the first time the joint office has existed in order to help coordinate an effort like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| So it's the first time a coordinated effort like this has happened in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| And we are so grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| I had the opportunity to visit each of the warming centers and volunteer at the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| And I know several council members had the opportunity to volunteer and help out in many ways as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| So I know that when you were there, just like when I was there speaking to the guests, you know, the hot meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| clean clothes, a warm place to spend the night, and just the warmth of the many volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| the restaurants and other people who were bringing food and clothing, that was very much appreciated by the guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| And I'm really grateful for Aaron Reid and everybody else for help making that possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Of course, I'm so proud of the city employees who helped the city get through this extreme weather situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=363)|
| 0:06:12| First, our public service crews were amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Our first responders, our 311 and 211 operators, our fleet crews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| all those vehicles that had to keep going to distribute salt and plowing and rescuing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| and dealing with all kinds of emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| The fleet department kept all those vehicles running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| And then the many, many partner agencies that coordinated through the Emergency Operations Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| These city employees and partners worked around the clock in sometimes quite dangerous conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| and going above and beyond the call of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| So I heard some stories, and maybe you've heard some of these too, but I know Public Service Director Chad Weth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| I'm not sure if he's here, he might be sleeping after working many long hours all last week along with his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| bringing water to stranded motorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Our new COO, Grant Rosenberg, I think he earned his operations stripes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| He got out there when we opened the warming center at South Knox Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| By the time that was starting to happen, there was no one available to plow the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| and he personally got out and helped shovel that parking lot so people could get in and out safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| So good job, COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| Our police and firefighters, not only did they fight fires and fight crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| they also helped transport dialysis patients, delivered donated food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| and just assisted people across the city, whether their vehicles were stranded or so many other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| So a big shout out to our police and firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| And there were just countless instances of people bringing space heaters to neighbors whose heat went out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=470)|

| 0:08:07| The people of Knoxville, individuals, churches, faith groups, businesses, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| everybody was really stepping up and exemplifying the volunteer spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=493)|

| 0:08:28| and access to medical facilities open throughout this difficult time, and that is our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| That is by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| We focus things on making sure people can be helped during times of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| And not one emergency call went unanswered in our city because of road conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| We used more than 3,000 tons of salt, logged more than 18,000 miles in our snow removal trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| So I'm really pleased and proud of the efforts we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| However, just like we do after every major event, we will assess what aspects of our emergency plans worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| and what areas might be that we could improve going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| So I want to thank Council for all the information sharing you got out to people in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| and connecting people to city services and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| And I want to thank the people of Knoxville for their patience and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| as we all dealt with some unprecedented weather situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| I also want to take a moment to let you all know that tomorrow, January 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| we will be celebrating the outstanding career of KPD Assistant Chief Mark Fortner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| I don't believe he's here this evening, but he has served the people of Knoxville for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| And, you know, I am so grateful for his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| He's done pretty much every job possibly that you can do with the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| including stepping up and acting as the chief of police during an interim period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| And I am really grateful for his leadership and his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| His retirement party will be at the Civic Coliseum Ballroom tomorrow at 4 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| and you are invited to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| And last, a quick reminder about our rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Those who wish to speak, either to a specific agenda item or during public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| should sign up with Mr. Johnson, the city recorder, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Council rules state that up to three people each may speak for or against an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| Right now, Item 12B, the mental housing agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| has more than the allowed number of speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| so I encourage those who have signed up to work together to elect spokespeople| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=628)|
| 0:10:37| in case council wants to stick to the rules and not suspend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| The people who signed up for that, the first three are Hanson Sale, Zoe Scott, Dustin Durham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| and the ones beyond the three that council rules allow are Aaron Jernigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| Jew Harper, Parker Bartholomew, Jared Worsham, Logan Higgins, and Tony Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| And the people speaking in opposition to Item 12B, there's only three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| so there's no surplus of people on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| So just wanted to remind everybody of council's rules on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Also, our rules of decorum require people to please avoid using profanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| and when speaking to specific agenda items, please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| Those who fail to adhere to those rules may be ruled out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| For those who are listening, please note you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I appreciate and advance everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| And that concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Council members, are there any reports from committees or council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| There were a lot of heroes last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| I just want to mention one first district resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Lakeisha Johnson lives in south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| and spent more than six nights in one of the warming centers just volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| And so everybody pulled their weight in some way, shape, or form to help others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| but she went above and beyond and basically lived there with hundreds of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| helping them with every human need imaginable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| So I'm grateful for people like Ms. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| I had one announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=732)|

| 0:12:25| substance abuse, and homelessness, and the public is open to attend that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=750)|

| 0:15:45| Additionally, Dr. and Mrs. Larry Summers own 5720 Lionsview Pike, and then Dr. and Mrs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=945)|
| 0:15:55| Overholt are also members of the Homeowners Association at 5802 Lionsview Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| Our request in this appeal is simply that you require Mr. Boer to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| The specific question before you is whether he is entitled to a variance from the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| front setback, and he is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| The variance is not justified because Mr. Boer will not suffer any hardship if the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Our position is supported by the law and facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| In 2015, Mr. Boer created the Villa Estates subdivision by dividing a little bit over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| four and a half acres into four smaller lots in one common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| In 2018, Mr. Boer lost the Villa Estates subdivision to a bank foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| In 2020, this body adopted Recode Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| At that time, Lot 3 became nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| After adoption of Recode, Mr. Boer, for his company, SB Southeast Development LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| reacquired the property from the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| At that time, it was after Recode, the lot was already nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| The property is currently undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| Under the current zoning ordinance, nonconforming lots are governed by Article 17.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| Nonconforming lots must comply with all but the lot width and area requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| Your nonconforming lot provisions do not provide an exception for the front setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1038)|
| 0:17:27| As members of city council, you're also probably aware of the Vested Property Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| That Property Rights Act strikes a balance between a developer's right to develop a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| and city council's authority to change zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| In order to maintain vested rights under the 2015 Act, Mr. Boer was required to obtain necessary permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| commence development, and pursue that development diligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Mr. Boer has no vested rights because he didn't do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| The property is currently undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Therefore, city plans review correctly determined that Mr. Boer must comply with Recode-Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| or obtain a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| But Mr. Boer is not entitled to a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| We've provided council with a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| He's not entitled to a variance because he created the condition which he's now complaining about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| He created the condition first when he subdivided Villa Estates in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| He made the lots an odd shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| They don't conform to the current regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| Second, he created his own condition when he failed to take those actions necessary to maintain vested rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| under the property rights statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| When he didn't take those actions to maintain his vested rights, he created this sort of nonconforming situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| Third, he created a nonconforming situation when he reacquired the property from the bank in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1131)|
| 0:19:00| knowing at that time that the lots were nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| I don't want city council to get bogged down in legal theory too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| Ultimately, denying Mr. Boer a variance will not cause him a hardship because he can go back through the subdivision process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| the same subdivision process he went through to create the Villa Estates subdivision to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| He can reconfigure the lots in the Villa Estates subdivision in a way that allows him to meet the required front setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| and develop his property without the need for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| And that is why denying a variance in this case is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| It will not cause a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| And we request that council approve this appeal and deny the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Now, I've got Mr. Gary Clark with me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| He is a registered land surveyor with over 40 years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| He's going to address the configuration and the ability to go back through the subdivision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| I will note that it appears that Villa Estates has 292 feet of frontage on Alliance View Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1199)|
| 0:20:08| The minimum lot width in recode is 75 feet in the R1 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| That would indicate to me at least that he would get at least three lots with sufficient frontage on Alliance View Pike and almost four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1214)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Next person signed up to speak on behalf of the appellant is Gary Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| If you, for the sake of everybody being here, you can either lift up the podium, there's a button to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| or maybe move the mic up a little closer to your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| Yeah, it's a pretty cool podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Okay, Mr. Clark, if you could just state your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Yes, it's Gary Clark, 6013 Centerwood Drive in Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| Most of what I can say is really Mr. Sanders has already gone over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| and I have been a professional land surveyor for about 45 years now with working in multiple jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| with various residential and commercial subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| The Oak Knoll Homeowners Association hired me through Lyle Jaeger and Brown to review the appeal documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1280)|
| 0:21:29| and their documents for the property at 5660 Alliance View Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| It's currently under record by a subdivision prepared by Michael S. Funderlick recorded in December of 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| and divided 4.59 acres into four lots and one common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| The Southeast Development Company, LLC, acquired all four of the lots by a single deed in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| which just described the property by referring to the Villas Estate's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| and this was after the adoption of Recode Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| When I visited the property a couple of weeks ago, there were no structures on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| or any evidence that any structures had been started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| As I said, as you're aware, subdivisions are governed by various rules by the state law and local subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| and in my experience, these change over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| and sometimes older subdivisions don't meet the current requirements or zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| In this case, the flag-shaped lots of Lot 3 may have met the requirements in 2015 when the plan was recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1355)|
| 0:22:45| but based on the city plans review and the building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| they'd have to go for the appeal because Lot 3 doesn't conform with the requirements of the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1369)|
| 0:22:58| I think it's important to note that since the one owner owns all the 4.59 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1378)|
| 0:23:07| that he has the option of going back through the subdivision process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| and re-dividing the property in a way that would conform to the current requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| And to be clear, I think the Villa Estates can be reconfigured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| so that the resulting lots would meet the current regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Now, on behalf of the respondent, Benjamin Mullins, you state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the original applicant, SB Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| Mr. Sanders, both in his January—550 West Main Street, Suite 500, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| Mr. Sanders, in his January 9 letter, and again tonight, set up a couple of strawman arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| specifically whether or not it meets a nonconforming exemption under Article 17.3 of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| and whether or not we are entitled to invested rights or did anything to acquire vested rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| I don't think those need to be addressed specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| I think we need to talk about the heart of the issue and whether or not a variance is justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| and whether or not that variance was a self-created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| But I'd be glad to answer questions on those specific legal doctrines if they come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| if you would give me an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| First off, what was a variance required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| As Mr. Sanders and Mr. Clark have acknowledged, in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| when the property originally subdivided into four lots, no variances were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| It was a legal subdivision at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| In fact, there was an existing house set back pretty much 213 feet from Lions View at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| on the property that has since been demolished, but that house was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| because it complied with the existing subdivision setback requirements for the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| and that is a minimum of 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| In 2015, there was no maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| You could put it wherever you wanted to as long as you were at least 25 feet away from Lions View Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| and that opinion has been confirmed by Mr. Ahrens, Director of Plans, Review, and Inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| in a January 5 email that was attached to my letter and is in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| The only reason for the variance is because when the 2020, now 2024, when Mr. S.B. Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1516)|
| 0:25:25| which is owned by Mr. Boroff, when he moved forward to put a house on a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| that he could have put in 2015 without any variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| RECODE had changed the setback to where the setbacks now have a plus or minus 10 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| of the average block face, but no less than 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| and the way that's been interpreted by Plans, Review, and Inspections is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| you take the average block face of the other homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| and you have to build it within 10 feet of that average block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| Here, that was 84.9 feet, but because of the preexisting lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| because of the flagpole lots, which were legally existing and are legally existing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| It is impossible to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| and the Board of Zoning Appeals summed that up very succinctly in the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| and this is on page 121 of your packet, where Ms. Cheryl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| a Board of Zoning Appeals member and an architect, says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I mean, this one is rather straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| I'm not sure there's a reasonable way it could have been done differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| because you can't move the house forward, backward, left, or right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| It's there, and Mr. Salisbury, who's an attorney, says, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| it's pretty much not going anywhere, and they approved the variance unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| This is in compliance with the rules that are in existence for determining what a hardship is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| Under 16.3, a hardship can be granted based upon exceptional narrowness, topography, or sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| and here there's no doubt where the front setback has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| It's an exceptionally narrow lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| 13.7203 or, I'm sorry, 207.3 says specifically that hardships are justified by reason of exceptional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1612)|
| 0:27:01| narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| and this is the most important part, at the time of the enactment of the zoning regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| When the zoning regulation was enacted in 2020, what we're talking about, recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| it was impossible to meet the setbacks at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| That lot was already too narrow to be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| This is the only place that it can be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Neither Mr. Clark nor Mr. Sanders have cited any statute, any law, any ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| any authority whatsoever that says you cannot get a variance if you could resubdivide the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| you could combine property, you have to acquire more property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| That's nowhere in your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| It's nowhere in state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| You're looking at the piece of property that was legal when it was created that is now only illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| cannot meet the setbacks because of the change of the ordinance, because of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Quite frankly, that is not a self-created hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| That is, what created the hardship, the need for the variance, is a change in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| which is exactly what 13-7-207 says you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| the shape of the property at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| Thirty-two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Two quick issues I want to preserve for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| One, I raised it standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Mr. Sanders created an HOA one day after the appeal period ran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| but filed the appeal period on behalf of a legal entity that did not exist at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| I don't think he has standing to move forward with the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Second, and I don't know if this is in the record or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| but I have an email here dated 11-21-2023 from Ms. Overholt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| where the neighbors expressly said they don't have a problem with the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| They're only concerned about potential access issues along the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| So for the record, I would also raise the defense they expressly disclaimed their objections to the setback at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Mr. Sanders, you have the opportunity for a two-minute rebuttal, if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1732)|
| 0:29:05| The specific piece of property that we're talking about is the entire Oak Knoll Home, not Oak Knoll Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| those are my clients, the specific piece of property we're talking about here is the entire Villa Estates subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| Granted, if property had been conveyed, a piece of property is going to be sterilized by a change in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1759)|
| 0:29:30| absolutely that would be a case to grant a zoning variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| You don't want to sterilize a piece of property because a change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| This is not the case with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| In this case, you adopted recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| It was your prerogative to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| At the time, SB Southeast Development did not own this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| They acquired it after recode, knowing the lot was nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Your nonconforming lot provisions only govern lot width and lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| There is not a provision in there for the required front setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| This is not an appropriate case to grant a variance because the piece of property that you're talking about is just not lot three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| It's lot one, two, three, and four, and then a common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Those lots can be reconfigured to meet the required front setback, and no hardship is going to result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| except maybe the hardship that Mr. Boroff won't be able to sell four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| He might be able to develop three or two or one, but that's not considered a hardship under your ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| because that's a financial burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| It's not a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| On the standing issue, this is a very technical objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| I can tell you the Homeowner's Association was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| It was authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| All the documents were signed before it was formed prior to filing the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| but for an e-mail address not being attached to the submission for the we would request that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1856)|
| 0:31:07| I can save your time on that one, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| The city council will not be making any decisions with regard to standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| He's preserved that record for the court, but city council does not make a standing decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| Okay, very well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Okay, that concludes your time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Council members, it's your opportunity for discussion and questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Mr. Mullins, I had some questions for you, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| It's my understanding from the discussion today that the owner also owns the surrounding lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| And that the owner created those lots and in doing so created the boundary lines for each of those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1905)|
| 0:31:57| And I recognize that was before the zoning code update, but the owner did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Mr. Boroff individually did that in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| The property today is owned by a corporation that is run by Mr. Boroff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| So you can say it's the owner or the same owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| It's controlled by the same entity, but it is technically a separate legal entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| But other than that, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| And at some point, the properties that this owner or corporation owns that we're subject for discussing today went into foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1942)|
| 0:32:36| And then this same person, corporation, bought those properties back and owns them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1956)|
| 0:32:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| And when they went into foreclosure, it was prior to recode, and they could have developed under the zoning ordinance at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| After they reacquired it, the zoning ordinance had changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| So when the owner buys the property from the bank after the foreclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| then there's different standards that are in place because the zoning code has been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| But since the owner owns all the properties in question, isn't the simplest solution here just to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| go back and replat and conform with the existing zoning ordinance today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| I don't think you're legally required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| You're looking at an individual lot and whether that lot complies with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| and the zoning ordinance or a variance is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| And here they can't meet the variance without a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| And under the hardship standards under 13.3.207,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| because of the exceptional narrowness and shape of the lot at the time the zoning ordinance was enacted here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| recode, it met the definition of a hardship under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Certainly I'll want to listen to my colleagues if they have any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| But from my review of the record and listening to the discussion today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| I don't find that a variance is appropriate here when the applicant acquired the property after new standards were in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| and is in a position to remedy their own hardship without need of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| So I'm going to make a move to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Motion's been made to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| It has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Any further questions or discussion by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2082)|

| 0:36:28| I just wanted to mention to Director Clabo how much I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| I know there were some business owners that were maybe having a little bit of traffic issues while the construction was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| but I know you sent some folks out to talk to them and work with them on making sure they were able to have folks get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| and out of their businesses there on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| So I just wanted to thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Of course, this is a great project because we're talking about adding in multimodal options along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2213)|

| 0:38:15| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| This item is for the Broadway Accelerated Bus Corridor Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| which I am very eager to see come to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Like many people who use Broadway regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| we're aware that this project was first announced back in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| and it is designed to improve traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| and to enhance the transit experience along North Broadway between downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| The end result will include traffic signal upgrades at the 36 signals along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Broadway corridor, the addition of new smart bus stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| which could display route information and provide additional amenities for riders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| and will ultimately provide signal priority for public transit vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| So approval of this item will allow us to finish some other studies around this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| project and move into the next phase of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| and I'm eager to see it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| So, Council Member Fugate, I mean, Council Member Ryder, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| We're sitting next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Mr. Clabo, I know the mayor just told us a lot about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| but I know Councilman Thomas and I are probably ready to jump up and down about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| this because we've been talking about this, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| a long time before I even came to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| So what's the time frames?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| When should we expect some stuff to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| This is we've had agenda items related to this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| and I asked what the time frames were then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| What's the time frame now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Tom Clabo, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| As you're aware, this is funded with federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| congested mitigation air quality, CMAQ money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| and so there's a process that goes with that that includes an environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| document, and then you go through a design process right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| then construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| We've had an initial contract with WSP to go through that environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| document process and start preliminary design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| and so that contract really has established the scope of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| So originally we were looking at two dual route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| so Route 22 with CAT and this accelerated bus corridor route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| In looking at those studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| they developed a model in looking at timing and signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| It really didn't save a lot of time as far as what the cost would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| utilizing two routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| and so we went through a selection process as far as what would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| correct type of project to put here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| The end result is we're essentially making a hybrid Route 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| so the accelerated bus corridor route is going to be the Route 22 that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| currently there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| but it does include these 36 signals to where we're going to upgrade those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| They will be able to communicate with the buses to give priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| There's queue jumping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| so that would mean a bus can get in the right turn lane and bypass traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| to get ahead of the queue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| and so the end result will be a much improved transit system along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| It's just it's taken a while to get there, but we do have good momentum now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| This new contract is going to complete the environmental process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| so when we converted from the dual route to one route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| we increased the bus stops to 27 along that we're going to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| That increased the amount of right-of-way we're acquiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| It affected the environmental document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| We have 190 parcels now affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| A lot of those are of the age that we've got to do a historic structure survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| on and on and on as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| so we've got to complete that environmental document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| get into a design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| That process should be complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| We're expecting construction in 2027, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| I'll let Councilman Thomas ask something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| You've done on this, sir, and we look forward to those improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| and it kind of goes back to some discussions that Councilperson Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| and I have with the Broadway Corridor Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| and we're glad to see those coming into fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| It would be much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2559)|

| 0:42:44| Thank you, Mr. Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a revised agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| and other associated revised loan documents with Bell Street 2LP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| to incorporate provisions caused by the project's delayed closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| recently requested modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| and a new development schedule with no change to the awarded amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| which is not to exceed $1,500,000 from the Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| and no change to the number of units to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| which is 50 permanent supportive housing units for very low-income seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| to be located at 245 South Bell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Councilmember Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| Mr. DeVos, can you tell us a little about what were the delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| the revisions that had to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Kevin DeVos, Housing and Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Ben Bentley's here also can speak to some of the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| But basically the lender wanted some change to the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| And so they weren't very big changes but were inconsistent with the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| that council passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| There was a clause determination that we needed to, you know, update this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| Ben has a good hold on what those financial terms were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| I don't need to know what the financial terms were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| I just wanted to make clear that the only thing was had something to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| lending documents that what we approved doesn't perfectly match what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| lender now requires, so we have to reapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Nothing substantial about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Let the record reflect that Ben Bentley nodded at that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Council Member, I didn't realize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| but there are two people signed up to speak in favor of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| First one is Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Mr. Bartholomew, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Parker Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| I'd like to draw your attention to page 293 of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| I'm very much in support of the KCDC and Austin Home redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| but I'd like to discuss the economics of creating 161 affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| On page 93 on the packet under sources and uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| you can see where the money comes from to be able to build a project like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| this, $28 million from LIHTC, $1.5 million from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| $7.5 million from a Section 208 HUD grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| and $900,000 from a National Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| I skipped over a few items to highlight this is only the public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| It totals up to $38 million on almost a $60 million project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| a little over 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| This means that each unit requires $236,000 in public funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| and that each unit total cost was $369,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| I want to give KCDC all the praise for putting together a deal like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I'm sure many years of hard work went into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| and it brought together many different avenues for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Last I heard, we had a wait list of vouchers of over 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| If we used the Austin Homes deals as a template in order to provide housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| for the current waiting list, we would need $1.1 billion in total funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| and $708 million in government funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| That's only for 3,000 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| I bring this up because LIHTC deals are one path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| just as multifamily housing on corridors is one path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| just as increasing the density in our neighborhoods with MMH is one path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| We need them all because any of them alone will fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| The shortage of units is too great to place artificial limits on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| We do not need to make it harder on ourselves by limiting all the tools that we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Next person on this topic is Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Mr. Ruggles, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| I live in Knoxville District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I'm also the treasurer of the Knoxville Area Tenants Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| I'm here speaking on behalf of the Tenants Union tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| The Tenants Union is cautiously in favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| We're happy to see that 50 units are going to be added for our seniors at $765 a month max rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2842)|
| 0:47:32| which is quite affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| We'd love to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| The renters living in these units will not pay more than 30% of their income for rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| which is great to see also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| We just had a handful of questions that we'd like to see answered that we couldn't necessarily find answers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| These questions are, who is going to be offering the referral services to fill these units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| Who is going to be offering the permanent support to the residents in these units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| And what is the process for filling these initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| and what happens after they're vacated and there are new residents that need to be filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| So we hope the discussion by the council here today will sort of address these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| And, yeah, we're excited that more affordable housing is going to be present here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| so we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Council members, further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| As you all know, we have done permanent supportive housing in many parts of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| This will be another one, and I know they're administered by different organizations, KLF, KCDC, McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| I think Mr. Ruggles raised some good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| I think we see these a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Somebody, Mr. Bentley or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| would like to address some of those questions about how these units are selected for different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| and the process for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| So Councilwoman Fugate let me off the hook easy, and now you're asking real questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| I'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| No, these are great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| So we have a waiting list that we open well in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| so we're sitting right now looking at a closing of about March on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| It's about an 18-month construction schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Roughly six months before that, we'll make just a blanket announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| As was mentioned by one of the public speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| there's lots of demand that we're opening the waiting list and people will be able to apply online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| in person, just like any of our other waiting lists at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| In terms of the supportive services, we'll actually have on-site case management with this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| so it's a little bit different from what we normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| The Section 202 program under HUD, that's one of the requirements of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| They want to make sure that folks can age in place for as long as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Sometimes it requires some additional resources to be able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| so that's what this program is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| Councilmember McKenzie and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I just wanted to take a moment and just acknowledge the efforts of Ben Bentley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| who is the CEO of KCDC, to be able to bring so many additional opportunities for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3022)|
| 0:50:30| and creative financing to the table and to the council and the mayor's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| Again, it doesn't solve all of our problems, but I think that we're definitely headed in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| This is really exciting to hear about the senior supportive housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| and just the amount of the rent that will be there and the supportive services that go along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| but just did not want to let this moment pass us by without acknowledging the efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| and the hard work that you and your staff put in, I think, every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| thinking of different ways and different, again, financial partnerships for us to be able to bring these types of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| you know, housing opportunities to our city and to those who are most in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| So I just wanted to recognize that in your efforts today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Mr. Bentley, you mentioned your waiting lists, plural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| When tenants want to move into a KCDC property, is there not like a one-point queue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3084)|
| 0:51:34| or they identify different properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| So there is a sort of a two-point queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Our two main programs are the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| and then anything that is KCDC owned and managed, so the physical units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Those, for HUD reasons, are kind of separate silos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| So it's two queues, not 20 queues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| I just want to make sure I didn't have to, like, as a tenant, identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| It's a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| I mean, I just made it sound real simple, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| It's not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| If I'm a tenant and I have a Section 8 voucher, what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| That is the more simple of the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| So that's one application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| And, I mean, you know the way the voucher works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| So 30% of income the resident pays, we kick in the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| and they find a unit on the private market, which is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| But from a simplicity of the program standpoint, that's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| All of our 21 KCDC properties have a little bit different eligibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| criteria, so that's where it gets quirky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| If, you know, I'm coming, applying for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I may not qualify for all 21 of the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| We have a screening system that has a series of questions on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| that's supposed to identify and help people hone in on, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| which sites they qualify for, bare minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| but then also some other aspects of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| access close to a bus stop, transportation, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| So where their preference might lie, and it kind of informs them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| and filters that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Is a staff person helping them with that, or is that done online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| If someone calls and needs assistance, we're happy to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| but it's predominantly an online system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| It's a self-guided system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| But some individuals have case managers that are helping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Yes, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Another part to one of the questions that was raised was about the permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| support of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Is that funded through ongoing contributions somehow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| or is it part of the finance package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Part of the finance package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| So the cool thing about that Section 202 program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| there's about a $7.5 million capital grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| They're paying for the building of those units, partially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| and so we're able to reduce the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| We also have a line item in the budget that we submit to HUD every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| that is for case management, so that will never go away on those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| It doesn't have to be fundraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| It's through the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| So the dollar figure given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| which I didn't write down for how much it is per unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| does that include the permanent supportive housing component, management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| all of those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| All of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I will add that when there are a few other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| it's probably more than you want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| but we take a developer fee and we don't do it for the same reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| other folks might do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| I'm not saying that we deploy these resources toward transforming Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| You're not paying stockholders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| I'm just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Yes, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| The citizens of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Council, I know you're aware, but housing is complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| and the city is doing a lot of work on it, and so are private investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| So we are having a housing workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| It's already scheduled on February 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| So we'll get into KCDC housing, private housing, blended, affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| market rate, middle, hopefully, and other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| So it is complicated and it is a huge need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| So I'm glad we're making progress at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| At every meeting we're adding to the housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3329)|

| 0:56:58| Yes, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| As you know, employee health and wellness is something that's often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| overlooked in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| It's something we've been investing in at KPD in the last couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| So we applied for a grant a while back that we were awarded through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| COPS Office, the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| And what that allows us to do is, over a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| to hire a health and mental wellness coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3437)|

| 0:57:31| our chaplain program, with our yoga for first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3451)|

| 0:57:47| So this position will exist for two years, $25,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3467)|

| 0:57:58| and there's no cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Yes, I think so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3480)|

| 1:03:28| So I just wanted to show you this is a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| and we want to monitor any changes as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| And that's what we've heard from the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| So before you begin your discussion, we have several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| And as I mentioned at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| there are more than six people signed up to speak in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| And three people signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| So if there we'll stick to your rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| and I'll call them in the order that they wish to be called in unless council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| wishes to proceed otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Council Member Singh, you need to turn your microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| I'd like to ask my colleagues if they would suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| And the reason for this is I've gotten a lot of e-mails that said we didn't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| a lot of public process, which we did do a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| But the people who have signed up to speak I think are coming from a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| different agencies and angles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| and I'm interested in hearing what the community has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| I am in favor of shortening the time, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| So what exactly is your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| I would like to hear from everyone for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| The motion's been made to modify your rules to listen to all the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| signed up on this item for up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Vice Mayor Smith, your lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Oh, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Okay, there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Vice Mayor Smith, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| I was just going to discuss the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I appreciate the perspective that you're bringing, Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| and obviously want to hear from as many people as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| but there's been a number of times where I feel like we've had to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| balance and fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| and I feel like whether there's four on one side and three on the other or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| none on one side and three on the other, I think that there's fairness required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| So I've voted consistently not to allow for that, so no offense to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| but I'm going to stay with that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| The motion, does everyone understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Oh, we've got more discussion over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| I also want to echo, I guess, in the spirit of fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| I'm not sure about my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| but I actually received several emails from people who were on the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| side that were opposed to this particular item and who stated that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| not going to be able to be here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| and so if we are talking in the spirit of fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I think to hear more on one side versus the other might be a little jaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| So because of that, I would not be in favor of hearing nine versus three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Any other questions or comments on this motion to modify your rules for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| can you refresh my mind of how speaking is allowed at the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| like number of speakers or amount of time and how it's allotted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| It's different than our rules, I know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| but just relevant to the question at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Amy Brooks, Knox-North County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| At the Planning Commission, individuals are given up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| They are asked not to repeat previous speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| but there's not specific rules like you all have in terms of three and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| But you don't allow an unlimited number of speakers at the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| I mean, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| I thought there was one body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| or maybe it's a certain type of appeal or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| or maybe it's BZA, I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| or a certain number of minutes per side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Is that not the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| So a total of five minutes per side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| but they often will grant additional minutes to both opposition and those at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| I can't speak to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| May I just want to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| I would be more inclined to support this if it were six and six or nine and nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| or five and five, but because it's uneven, that's my reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| All those in favor of the motion to change the rules on this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| We'll go back to calling them as three, four, and then three in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| First person to speak in favor of this is Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Mr. Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4095)|

| 1:08:40| next to the elderly widow who's lived in the neighborhood for 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4120)|

| 1:08:47| Exclusionary zoning is one of the main causes of the current housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| Currently in Knoxville, either there are no units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| or the units that are available are priced out of reach for the majority of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| We created this with our decades of zoning policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| excluding anything other than single-family residential on large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| In Knoxville, that's over 70% of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| One thing that everyone can agree on with MMH is that it will allow for more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4148)|

| 1:09:50| I think many that are trying to protect the character of neighborhoods would also agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| that they would not be able to purchase their home or move into their current neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| if they had the same challenges back then as we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4197)|

| 1:10:37| The median price for a house in Knoxville is over $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| with a mortgage payment around $2,700 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| This requires a yearly income of over $85,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Here are the people that cannot live in our neighborhoods without MMH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| Police officers, firefighters, teachers, most city and county workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| CB workers, social workers, and on this week, snowplow drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| Even in two-income households, when you double those salaries of the people that I just listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| it's not possible without being severely cost burdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| When a city or a neighborhood will not allow these folks to live, we have a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| Preserving the character of a neighborhood screams at the same arguments used during redlining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| You must be able to look past these fears and see the damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| that exclusionary single-family residential zoning has caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| Passage of MMH will show that those not in the upper income levels deserve the same opportunities for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| The first thing we must do is increase the supply of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| MMH allows us to do that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| The next person speaking in favor of this is Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| Be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4310)|

| 1:11:57| Cool. Thank you for the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| My name is Drew Harper. I live at 4318 Washington Pike, number 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| I am a small-scale incremental developer. I am vice president of Yes Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| I am the Democratic nominee or candidate for assessor of property in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| and I'm also policy director of Forward Focus Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| which is an organization that helps elect progressive and Democratic candidates to local office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| because we believe in the importance of making positive progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| We've helped some of your campaigns, whether you know it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| and because we believe change is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| I recently saw the policy platform from the Trump-aligned Heritage Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| for their planning out his second term, which includes the lines such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| a conservative administration should oppose any effort to weaken single-family zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| It also says that the next Congress should prioritize support for single-family zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| or for single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| If you haven't seen that document, it's horrifying, and I encourage you to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| In contrast, the Democratic National Committee's policy platform says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Democrats believe the government should take aggressive action in increasing the supply of homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| especially affordable housing, not exclusively affordable housing, especially affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| Democrats believe that the government should take aggressive action in increasing supply of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4410)|
| 1:13:42| On a national level, dozens of representatives, including Ilhan Omar and Maxwell Frost and Katie Porter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| have signed on to the People Over Parking Act, which would eliminate parking mandates by transit nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| Pretty cool, and I know that's part of this, is reducing parking mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| And they've had a lot of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Other cities like us have passed more sweeping reforms than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| There's a lot of good things coming out of Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| There is a term for people who are skeptical of incremental reform and defer to the status quo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| when faced with these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| That term is conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| William F. Buckley famously defines that a conservative is someone who stands athwart history yelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| And to him, that, of course, is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| It's a courageous act to slow down the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| I happen to completely disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| I think that the courageous thing is exactly the opposite, to champion progressive change and reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4482)|
| 1:14:52| So let's look at my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| Bucking the status quo will require courage, risk-taking, and leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| Tonight, council's votes will speak louder than words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| I respectfully ask you, if you align more closely with the Far-Right Heritage Foundation or the center-left Democratic National Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4508)|
| 1:15:17| do your votes align more with William F. Buckley or Katie Porter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4517)|
| 1:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Next person signing up to speak in favor of this is Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Mr. Durham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Oh, are you switching out to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Mr. Sale, Hanson Sale, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4538)|

| 1:15:44| To speak in support of this resolution, the housing crisis is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| Home prices in Knoxville have increased 85 percent since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| So a house that was $250,000 then is now worth an average of $462,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| This is a crisis that touches the lives of our friends, our neighbors, many of our city's most essential workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| those who keep our community safe, teach our children, and respond to our medical emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| The data bears it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| According to our research, the starting salary for a KPD officer is enough to afford exactly 2 percent of homes listed for sale in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| A teacher, 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| A registered nurse, 5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| These are the people who are hurt the most when we fail to address the structural faults in our land use policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| Obviously, we have an obligation to listen earnestly to the concerns of our fellow citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| but we also have a duty to grapple with uncomfortable realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| When we say no to reforms that help increase the housing supply, who are we saying no to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| Is it the young family looking for their first home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| The retirees searching for an affordable place to spend their golden years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| Or the young professionals that we champion as defining what will be Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| To achieve the goal of a city where housing is abundant for all, we have to grapple with those uncomfortable realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| We have to grapple with the fact that our land use policies today are in part why our community has for well over a decade failed to produce the amount of housing we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4638)|
| 1:17:29| A symptom of the structural impediments and the outdated land use policies that don't reflect our current housing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| This isn't a political issue. It's not a right or a left issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| It's a we have to care about our residents and meet the needs of our community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| People on both sides of the aisle can recognize that this is an important issue, something that we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| And sometimes that requires uncomfortable realities and uncomfortable votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| But doing the right thing doesn't always feel great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| And some of the most towering achievements that we have had in this country and in this city were not broadly supported by some people at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4682)|
| 1:18:10| But we had to do it because it was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| And for these reasons, our associations and many of the people in this audience are asking for your vote to advance these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| As one of the many land use reforms that will help us ensure that affordable housing is safe and within reach for all Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| Again, it's not a political issue. It's a decency and government issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| We have to meet the needs of the people who are on the streets today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| The people who most need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| You know, we can't listen to, you know, many of these neighborhoods, particularly the TDR were built before land use regulations even existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4721)|
| 1:18:51| And we're trying to impose modern land use requirements like onerous parking requirements and banning single family rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4731)|
| 1:19:00| Not single family rentals, but single, but only keeping single family homes and nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| You know, these these neighborhoods that we're talking about, they were built before all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| And so really, this is to honor the character of our neighborhoods, to go back to what we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| I listened to a great presentation from a student at UT that showed us a beautiful map of Park Ridge and showed us that there was 15 different types of commercial establishments in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4755)|
| 1:19:28| Today, there's only one. We're honoring our history by passing new regulations that recognize that our neighborhoods have always been vibrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4768)|
| 1:19:39| And I hope you will support that today and recognize that people across the political spectrum can come together and support housing because it's a basic human right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4779)|
| 1:19:50| And we have arbitrary limits on the most basic and fundamental of human rights in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4790)|
| 1:19:57| And I hope to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| Thank you. Next up are three people who are speaking in opposition to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| First is Deborah Thomas. Miss Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| Deb Thomas. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| If you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4815)|
| 1:20:25| First of all, this isn't part of my speech. I would like to state that I'm not and never have been a Trump supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| My name is Deborah Thomas. I've lived in Oakwood for 28 years and I object to being limited to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| But I'm glad we've got our five to speak against a zoning ordinance that impacts myself and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| I know neighbors that object to this and couldn't navigate the planning website to say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| Other neighbors are afraid to speak up or don't understand what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| Still, other neighbors think this is about affordability, so they support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| This is essentially a rezoning without proper notice or meetings to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| It's not about affordability, as was explained to us by planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| You cannot beat supply and demand when Tennessee is third in the country for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| You cannot beat supply and demand when investors own a third of real estate and young people cannot afford to buy their first, and in my case, only home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4869)|
| 1:21:18| Not to mention interest rates, which were almost 9 percent when we bought our affordable home in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| The median income for areas like Oakwood is around $50,000, most likely less in Lonsdale and parts of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| This disproportionately impacts low-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| I cannot speak for other neighborhoods as far as demolition and gentrification, but it is certainly happening in Oakwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| I hope city council members review my pictures of demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| We also have many people parking in front yards already, so decreasing parking requirements may increase profits for developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| but it doesn't help neighbors walking or driving down crowded streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| We already have density and diversity, if you read my email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| Passing the missing middle ordinance will accelerate gentrification and decrease workforce housing availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| This will not help our local communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| We only have five empty lots in the area that I outlined for you in email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| This ordinance is heartless if it does not contain demolition protection for existing workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| limit the zoning change to currently empty lots, increase the parking requirements to one space per unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| and regulate Airbnb instead of deregulating our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| We need to focus on the empty corridors, not existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| So who does this benefit? Not the neighbors who are being pushed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| like my neighbor from Mexico who didn't have a hot water heater for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| When she left, the property was upgraded and is now an Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| This will benefit realtors and investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| In closing, this is not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| If anything, it will increase housing prices in general and further eliminate existing workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| And this will not fix the bus system either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| This is rushed, it's not vetted, and there's not enough residential input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| Please postpone this and have more meetings, presentations, and workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Delay this until the council workshop in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| It was also mentioned at the planning meetings that the local realtors helped pay for the Optico study this ordinance is based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| I'd like clarification of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Bob Wetzel still opposes this and told me to say so, but couldn't make it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| I want to thank you for the limited time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| You have the full five minutes, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Yes, and I can yield my time to Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| He's right on the money, and I anticipated a three-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| Just for the record, everybody gets up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| If you don't use it, then you can't extend it to another person to add to their five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| Next person signed up to speak against this measure is Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5031)|
| 1:23:57| It's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| I'm speaking on behalf of Community Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Earlier today, I emailed city council members a comprehensive document about agenda item 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| We are requesting that this item be postponed for at least 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| Many people still cannot get down their driveways, and the schools are still closed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| A postponement would allow time for city council to hold a workshop with public participation for the first time since September 28, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5065)|
| 1:24:34| A workshop is necessary to closely examine the proposed amendments, which includes many important changes since the previous workshop, including RN1 for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5074)|
| 1:24:45| If city council does not postpone and agree to schedule a workshop, then we respectfully request and urge you to vote against these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| Community Forum previously wrote to city council before the workshop on September 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| We detailed concerns about the text and the rush to get this through NOx planning on October 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| After a 5-5 tie, they postponed this until December 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| The Planning Commission made important revisions to their recommendation at that meeting, including the parking standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| which reduced from one required off-street parking place per dwelling unit to none if located within one quarter mile of a transit route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5114)|
| 1:25:23| and 0.7 spaces per dwelling unit if not near a transit route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| This mistakenly assumes that people living near a transit route do not own cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| One duplex might have four cars and zero required off-street parking if near a transit route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| This revision needs to be removed from the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| None of those changes have been debated or considered by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| Many in the public don't even know about this change, which was proposed by the realtors and developers, not the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| A workshop is necessary to discuss and carefully consider every line in the ordinance's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| As with the recode city council workshops, the public should be allowed to participate in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| Yes, it is a tedious process, but it must be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| We must be sure that everything in the ordinances is clearly written and enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| We need to consider unintended negative consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Few members of the public really understand the impact these amendments will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| We fear that affordable housing properties will be purchased by investors, many from out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| who will tear down the house, which is affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| and replace it with something new that clearly will not be affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| This will displace residents at a time when finding comparable affordable housing is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| Our letter details amendment text and substantive issues with the amendments on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| These amendments amount to a rezoning of 15,835 residential parcels in R and 1, 2, 3, and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5203)|
| 1:26:52| which are located in the traditional neighborhood residential district known as TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| It is not being called a rezoning, and it is not going through the normal rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| but in reality that is the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| What one reasonably thought was their zoning suddenly isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| People bought and invested in their properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| knowing what was allowed to be built in their neighborhood based on the zoning and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| Now, without their participation in a public meeting, their property could be adversely affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| and their neighborhood could change dramatically with the addition of housing types previously prohibited in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| These amendments are changing the uses allowed without a public hearing or public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| The public is largely not even aware that this would be the result of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| How many of these property owners in TDR requested this change to their neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| Are City Council members prepared to defend such an unprecedented, drastic action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| when many people discover what happened to their neighborhood because of two votes at City Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| There are concerns about the administrative review approval process of all requests for middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| and the complete lack of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| This process takes place in planning staff offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| How will the public know there is a middle housing request under review by planning staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| How do they know they can appeal to planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| The first notice a neighbor might get is the start of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| Some special uses will become permitted uses and others not allowed currently in the zoning district will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| These are enormous changes in our administrative rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| Provisions in the zoning ordinance must be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| Words must be defined and not vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| We support alternatives such as utilizing major corridors with plenty of vacant space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| What is being proposed will have adverse impact on property owners and long-established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| This is not about affordable housing, but it could affect it in a terrible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| This should not be approved at the current time and perhaps not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| We respectfully request you to postpone item 12B to allow for much more vetting of the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| and to allow more public participation in a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| If you have not had a chance to read my letter, I hope you will go back and read it because I've had to omit one paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5345)|

| 1:29:08| The next person signed up to speak against this item is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Mr. Roach, you'll have up to five minutes if you start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5350)|
| 1:29:19| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| A little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| I'm old enough to let you all know I grew up through urban removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| I'm going to call it renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| It was removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| And you can look out and you can see because this is what it's really about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| It's about what a community, what a neighborhood, what a group of people have, what the neighborhood looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| what the community looks like, the resources, the things that make a community, how they're established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| But when they're taken away, when you may have some thoughts on this, zoning is not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5394)|
| 1:30:07| A good developer, a bad developer, you work your way through the process, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5407)|
| 1:30:17| You already have it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| Think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I just watched a gentleman go through a variance process and you all voted on it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| You make changes when you want to make changes if it fits your agenda, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| So I watched perfectly decent neighborhoods wiped out and nothing's ever replaced those homes, that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5437)|
| 1:30:48| That's how far legislative local bodies in Knoxville, Tennessee called city council have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5448)|
| 1:30:57| And you have failed to do the hard things in terms of giving communities and here's the let's bring it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5457)|
| 1:31:09| Let's bring it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| It's about race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| So-called race, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Black folk got wiped out, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| All through East Knoxville and Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, got wiped out, moved, changed up on, power taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5479)|
| 1:31:28| They have no community power, empowerment, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| And we've gone through different phases of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| And I participate in some of those processes where the city couldn't make a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| So you jumped in on these federal programs and everything and all this money came through and we're in worse shape now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5499)|
| 1:31:48| We have a housing crisis and the only reason you're talking about it now is because a bunch of young white folk are having a hard time finding a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5508)|
| 1:31:57| Let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| So if you all don't, I don't want to sit around here and wait for the final picture to take shape because then it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5520)|
| 1:32:12| I repeat, then it is too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| Whatever your agendas are, okay, if you start from a position of goodwill, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5536)|
| 1:32:25| But you better have people at the table who are going to be affected one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| You've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| I know because I've gone through those processes and I've spoken the truth about a situation just based on my own experiences and other people like me's experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5554)|
| 1:32:44| And you don't listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| You don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| And it's got to get to the point where either you make those hard decisions and quit blowing smoke up people's behinds or you're going to have social disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5569)|
| 1:33:04| You're just going to have the haves and the have-nots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| It is that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| And that might not come in my life, in the rest of my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| It might not happen, but it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| And then people are going to write about you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Well, city council didn't do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| Listen, you've got communities that don't have schools in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| Those were communities primarily occupied by a majority black population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| That was deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| Understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| That was deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| You wiped out churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| But Kenny, you can talk to your dad about that, about moving worship centers away out of a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5622)|
| 1:33:51| And then some of them got reestablished, but a bunch of them didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| So we're talking about social construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| That's what that's what you guys do at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| And I hate to say it, but I don't expect much from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| Overall, collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| Because people are without services, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| And it's rough out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| You guys know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| That concludes the public speaking on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| So, sorry, I'm not really good at writing speeches, and I kind of freewheel my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| So that's where I'm going to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| And there's a variety of concerns and questions that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| I made a motion for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| I attended many meetings with my neighborhoods, and some of them were very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5692)|
| 1:35:00| I want to point out to you guys, Will passed out to my colleagues up here this color copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| That's for me, and I'll just explain to you what it is, if you don't mind following along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| The first page is a fourplex that I lived in, missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5710)|
| 1:35:21| And the reason it has two pictures on the page there is I just wanted you to see all the single family houses that surround it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| On the left side of the top frame is an infill brick home in the historic area there, north of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5728)|
| 1:35:35| And so the second structure is the fourplex that I lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| It was a studio apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| And as you can see, the scale matches all of the houses on both sides of the street all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| And it was historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| It was old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| The second page, if you turn to it, which is the structure on North Park, is an Italianate house that was renovated by a family I was a nanny for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5749)|
| 1:35:58| It was an upper and a lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Both doors face Park in the Chatham Arch neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| And if not but for, I may not have met Stephen Rider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| His former roommate was an occupant down below, a med student, and I was a nanny for a med student above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| You can't see in the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| There's teeny tiny little windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| I had a futon bed on the floor in the attic space up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| The third page is 432 East 11th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| That was what you see in the picture are five of ten infill townhouses that were built in the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5789)|
| 1:36:37| The first five were built in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| I think the second five were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| It was built in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| These were vacant remnant lots that were created by the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| Each unit had one parking space per the three bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| We had a garage that we got to down the alley in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| And as you can see there on the end, you see two shared parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| Those were the visitor spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| So the other five units had two visitor spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| We had two visitor spaces, and we had our parking spaces back behind, one per unit in our garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5819)|
| 1:37:08| I've lived in missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| I didn't know that's what it was when I lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| And that gave me the opportunity to be a renter and then live in structures in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| I purchased the townhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| And we sold it and we moved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| That turned me on into being into historic walkable neighborhoods after growing up in a trailer in the woods near nobody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5846)|
| 1:37:34| seven miles from my school, from my grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| I hated growing up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| I love living in walkable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| Having a variety of types of structures in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| And by the way, demolition is not an issue up there, and I'll ask Ms. Crockett to touch on that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| Nothing was torn down to build the new townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| The other things were historic or old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| They were old, whatever, if using the word historic is a turnoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| Since the conversations and the presentation from Opticos came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| I've done a lot of research and study and listened to a lot of podcasts and read books about the history of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| and find the origins of single-family housing, which started about 1916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5898)|
| 1:38:27| Actually, the first place it passed was Berkeley, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| And I find its origins and its rationale to be offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| And so I cannot say that it makes sense to only support single-family housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5916)|
| 1:38:44| especially when I look around the historic neighborhoods in our community and there are all of these types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5924)|
| 1:38:52| Also, my few seconds I have left before we open the fields to discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| I have a neighbor couple that just had to move because there were limited options for them to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| They were aging out of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| They needed something that was one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| The wife was a former president of my neighborhood and did not want to leave our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| but couldn't find anything to be able to age in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| And that's what happens when you don't have a variety of types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| You don't have entry options and you don't have later in life options for people to be able to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| And I asked that person today, if I built something that was a duplex and single level and met your needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| would you want to move back and did you want to stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| And their answer was yes, but they were forced to leave because there wasn't enough housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| I'll let somebody else speak before I speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| I'll just offer that I currently live in an example of a stacked duplex in one of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| in the traditional neighborhood zones that will be affected by this middle housing proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| I think I'm a pretty good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| My tenants throughout the time we've lived here have always been good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| and I know that from the outside the definition of middle housing that resonates most with me is that it's house scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| It doesn't look out of character with the neighborhood, but it just has more than one household in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| And I've been living in that the last 23 years, but also I've lived in middle housing examples in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| I've lived as a renter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| And, again, it's not necessarily the choice that everybody prefers, depending on your preferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| depending on your budget, depending on your stage in life and how many people are in your household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| But for the many people right now who are looking for housing, it can create more housing supply within the same amount of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6042)|
| 1:40:49| So it's more supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| It's more sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| It's more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| It's just in alignment with a lot of the goals of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| And I'm really grateful for your consideration and hope for your support this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| I appreciate everyone coming and talking to us about this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| So, Director Swanson, I kind of want to start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| Based on some of the feedback I've heard and then some of the things we heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| that having reviewed this ordinance change and given the proposal changes uses in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| specifically here, the TDR, is this ordinance change required to go through the normal rezoning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6095)|
| 1:41:43| Well, the ordinance change is, in fact, required to go through the normal rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| and it has been through the normal rezoning process, which is initiated before planning and then ultimately arrives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6109)|
| 1:41:58| So, based on the process that this ordinance change has gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| council is within its ability to move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| and you don't have to do individual rezonings for each of the properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Those are individual rezonings for individual parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| What we're talking about here is a change in the zoning code itself that applies to various districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| and those will apply to all of the parcels of property that are located within the particular district to which they apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6144)|
| 1:42:32| And so you don't have to come back and go through individual rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Director Brooks, we heard mention of some of the changes that were made with regard to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6159)|
| 1:42:47| That went through the planning commissioners making that in their meeting in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6167)|
| 1:42:54| My question for you is, did planning staff have a chance to review those parking changes since the way it came up in the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6174)|
| 1:43:04| As you mentioned, Council Member, the changes that were made to the parking standards happened in the meeting itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| which is within the purview of the planning commission, to do on any agenda item before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| So staff did not review them in advance, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| Do you have any sense for, I mean, this is a difficult question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| but is there anything out of line with what is being proposed from the parking changes from what you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6205)|
| 1:43:34| and what you would expect staff's reaction to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| You do point out that it would be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| I cannot say for sure if our recommendation would be different if we had been asked to review the proposal in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| but I can tell you that planning staff have no concerns with what has been recommended by planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| And then I wanted to turn to our chief policy officer, Ms. Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| One of the concerns that I had had after our workshop in September was that the appeals process be laid out well in the ordinance for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6241)|
| 1:44:09| And looking at Section 4.6G, I see that references made in that section to that staff approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6249)|
| 1:44:17| or denial under the section can be appealed to planning commission and council under Article 16.12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6257)|
| 1:44:26| Am I reading that appeal process correctly that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| basically what's being said there is if there was an issue with the staff approval process from either party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6270)|
| 1:44:41| that they could then appeal to planning commission and that could eventually come to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| just like we see in a lot of other instances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| I want to make sure that Mr. Swanson feels free to weigh in on this with me and also Amy, Ms. Brooks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6290)|
| 1:45:04| It is our understanding that the intent here is to assure that there is that process indeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6304)|
| 1:45:14| and that you basically have stated it exactly the way that I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| And then in reviewing the Opticos report, which is where this really kind of originates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| it's coming from that with this missing middle proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| If I read that report correctly in my understanding from the discussions that we've all had in workshops and elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6331)|
| 1:45:41| this proposal is appropriate within the TDR because of the grid pattern, the sidewalks and the bus services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6341)|
| 1:45:49| the infrastructure basically that is in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| Is that basically correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Is that why the TDR has been selected here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| As we looked at the geography of Knoxville and where there were walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| bikeable communities, where there was transit support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| where there were neighborhood servicing businesses within a walkable and bikeable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| the TDR geography ended up lining up really well with where our strongest infrastructure already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6374)|
| 1:46:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| My time expired, so I'll have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| I just want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| I'm not sure who wants to jump in and answer this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| but I just want to ensure that, let's say, a building permit is pulled by a developer at one of these in the TDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6398)|
| 1:46:47| neighborhood that's identified and a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| Will they still have signage out in advance that there's been permits pulled, that there will be some building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6410)|
| 1:46:58| I know that in a lot of the e-mails and phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| people have said that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| how are we going to know until we start seeing some construction and giving them an opportunity to be able to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| or call planning staff to find out exactly what level of missing middle housing will be being built in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6431)|
| 1:47:24| Ms. Ball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I definitely will be happy to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| Actually, I think Ms. Brooks might be the most appropriate person to go first on this, and if I need to chime in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| I'd be happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| As currently proposed, there is not a sign requirement to be posted for these particular projects because it is a permitted use and not a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6459)|
| 1:47:51| We have a mechanism to post all applications, whether or not they are administrative or require Planning Commission approval on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6471)|
| 1:48:00| We already do this for other administrative approvals, such as PLATs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| You can go on our website and find all PLATs that have been submitted for review and approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| and we also do that for level one certificate of approvals for our overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| If I could clarify, building permits are what you asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Already, building permits are posted on people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| If someone is doing a renovation or building, those are already on the property, and that wouldn't change at all in this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Those things are going to be the same when this passes, just the way they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| Council Member Fugett, and then we'll go back to Reiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| Thank you. I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| I know that the intent of this is to not have demolitions, and that's what I hear people are really concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| is that you're going to be able to tear down something, build something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| It'll be more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| It might negate the affordability price, and I do think we need to be very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| and understand that more housing makes housing affordable, but middle housing is not necessarily affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6548)|
| 1:49:20| It can have an impact, but some units, if they're built new, are going to cost what they cost, just like new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6560)|
| 1:49:29| So I don't want us to mix those things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| They are both good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| New construction and affordable housing can be the same thing, but missing middle is not always affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6576)|
| 1:49:45| My question is, what about demolition permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| I should know this, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| I don't remember it because I watched a house in my neighborhood get torn down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| and I don't recall any sort of permits about a demolition permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| and I think that's something that people are afraid of as well, that one day a house will be being torn down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6602)|
| 1:50:08| and they didn't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| Is there a process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Well, first, as you point out, sometimes things can be demolished right now, with or without this, because it's private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| I think our historic overlay districts require a demolition permit with a waiting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| I don't remember the particulars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| Ms. Ball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Specific to historic properties, there is an additional delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| There is a demolition permitting process in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| and if you have specific questions about that particular process, I probably would call on Brian Berry to speak to that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6637)|
| 1:50:49| Mr. Berry, could you come to the podium and explain the demolition, the way it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| and if it would be changed, if so, how, by a middle housing proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| Brian Berry, city of Knoxville, Planned Revenue and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| The way the demolition process is currently set up with the city is an individual make application for demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| and as you had said, there are properties that are identified in the H1 or NC1 overlays where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6669)|
| 1:51:20| when demolition permits are applied for, we reach out to planning and notify them that these demolition applications have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6680)|
| 1:51:29| and they, in turn, go through the process that's set up through those overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| As of right now, within the middle housing, there's not, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| anything set up for a demolition of a property if it's outside of those overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6700)|
| 1:51:47| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| I mean, my point was just that just because it's an old neighborhood doesn't mean it's protected by a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6708)|
| 1:51:55| Demolition is demolition, and from a property rights standpoint, if you own the property at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| you can just pull a permit and demolish it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| Ms. Crockett, you and I talked about this because this was one of the big concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| The historic zoning, the H1 neighborhoods with H1 overlays have demolition protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| The neighborhood conservation districts also have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| And I know that includes Emerland, Fairmont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| So if you'd like the neighborhoods in this area that that includes, that's Edgewood Park City, Fairmont, Emeryland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6756)|
| 1:52:43| Forth and Gill, Mechanicsville, and Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| When you say Edgewood Park City, not all of it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| Not all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Not all the way to Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| The historic overlay, not the National Register overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| And if I could also clarify, the demolition delay, that's part of the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| Planning staff, in particular the person named the Historic Preservation Planner in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| reviews all demolition permits that are pulled in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| So I receive an email from someone, the permit techs at Plans Review, every time any demolition permit is pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6791)|
| 1:53:18| and we review them for historic significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| It doesn't have to be an H or NC overlay for a 60-day demolition delay to be enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| Typically, we use those that have local historic significance or are on the National Register but don't have formal designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6808)|
| 1:53:36| Properties that are in an H or NC overlay go through an additional review process for demolition by the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| So there's a percentage, there's a larger percentage of properties in the TDR that don't have overlay protection like NC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6824)|
| 1:53:52| And to also be clear, NC overlay does not require some of the same guidelines that, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| 4th and Guild Park Ridge, Old North have, Mechanicsville, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| The NC overlay is a lot less restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| Individual districts have different design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| So Fairmont, Emerylands are different from another NC overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| They all have demolition review baked into them, and that all goes through the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| So the process is the same, whether it's H or NC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| But neighborhoods that don't currently have overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| what's the minimum number of properties that we would have to group together to get protection from demolition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| For a historic overlay, it could be an individual property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| We have many of those in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| For a neighborhood conservation overlay, the minimum area is 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| What are the other tools we have to prevent demolition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| I think you and I talked about you have other tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| And I just want to point out, so you're notified every time any demolition permit is pulled for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| That means we already have a system in place to be able to count, tally, and monitor demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| Okay, because that was one of the questions that has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| And, Ms. Ryder, as I mentioned, we can then measure if there's any change that we think is attributable to middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6911)|
| 1:55:19| and report back to council at least annually and more often if we see trends that are affecting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6919)|
| 1:55:26| So what other tools are there besides overlays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| So we have current tools, and then we have potential future tools that could be incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| Right now, currently, we have historic or NC overlays in neighborhoods where that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| We have the demolition delay code, and there's the possibility to expand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| And then we also have in the middle housing standards the conversion standards as a pretty critical tactic to disincentivize demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6944)|
| 1:55:52| allowing these existing houses to be retained and converted to a middle housing form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| There are additional potential tools, so expanding that demolition delay code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6958)|
| 1:56:04| other creative city solutions like working with deconstruction or programs to support naturally occurring affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6964)|
| 1:56:11| which I know Housing and Neighborhood Development is already working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| and then enacting requirements to submit plans for new construction along with demolition permit applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6974)|
| 1:56:23| We've seen that a lot of the municipalities that have adopted these types of codes have incorporated something like that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| Have we had discussions about expanding the delay ordinance that we have already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| We have not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Okay, but that's a local ordinance that we could act upon and make pretty expedited changes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=6996)|
| 1:56:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| I'll let my other colleague ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| I had some similar comments to Councilman Fugate and Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| I think you've illustrated something that I think I just want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| is that we already have a mechanism to report demolition as it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| Are there other metrics, either Ms. Ball or anybody else in the administration, that we will be monitoring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| Can you talk about how we're going to quantify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| Because I think brass tacks, the goal of this is to provide more supply in neighborhoods so that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| even if adding more housing doesn't immediately reduce the average price of a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| I might be able to rent in the neighborhood that I want to live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| or I might be able to rent in a neighborhood that I want to buy in in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| So I've been in similar circumstances, as Councilman Ryder described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| But what's really important is that if we're going to be bold and do something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| and admit there's some risk associated with it, what does the data show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| Because I do think demolition is a real, logical concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| It's one that I've heard voiced everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| But what do the data from other cities show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| and what data will we be measuring beyond just demolition permits to monitor progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7076)|
| 1:58:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| It is a topic that we've been discussing for some time now, the need to data track this initiative at many different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7084)|
| 1:58:14| And, you know, sometimes the laundry list of things that you look at is pretty extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7094)|
| 1:58:21| But categorically, we would definitely be looking at demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| We'd be looking at the types of middle housing that are being permitted and constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| We would look at details related to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| And all of the different elements that you see in the different sections of this code are all things that we want to know information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7116)|
| 1:58:45| so that we can identify if there are needs and opportunities for us to go in and make tweaks and changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7125)|
| 1:58:54| I think it's a really important thing that we remember that our code is a living and breathing document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| and it has to adjust with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| And it's important that we are monitoring what's happening so that we can make adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7141)|
| 1:59:08| if we see something that looks like it's not working the way that we had intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| And did Planning Commission, I guess from Ms. Brooks, did Planning Commission require certain reporting on a reoccurring basis as a result of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7154)|
| 1:59:23| Yes, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| They did ask for us to report out if this was to pass on at least a yearly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| So if this was to pass, we would produce a report by December, if not earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| So this body, along with the rest of the public as part of Planning Commission, or just this body, will have access to those metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7176)|
| 1:59:43| We will see the progress or lack thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| We will see warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| We will see demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| This body, if it moves fast enough, can stop some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| Or, as Ms. Crockett alluded to, we can amend our existing ordinances to put a stop on things if we see things going in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7193)|
| 2:00:03| I just want to call – sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| I said correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| I don't know where the voice came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| So my point is if we're going to be bold and make some changes that are a little uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| but we feel like allow for people who want to buy and particularly want to rent to live in neighborhoods where they cannot now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7215)|
| 2:00:23| we have some metrics to look at and monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| This is not a thing that's going to flash and change overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| So that's some of the things – some of the concerns I've heard are real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| But I think, Ms. Ball, part of the question I had earlier was I've asked you multiple times, well, what have other cities seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| And I think your response to me is those cities haven't seen a significant increase in demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Other cities that have passed middle housing zoning code changes have not seen dramatic really changes at all in their demolition permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7247)|
| 2:00:59| And so we don't know for sure that that will be the case here, but the other cities that have done something similar most certainly have not seen that be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7259)|
| 2:01:10| And obviously I think most people in this room realize this is not citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| There's a TDR designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| Some folks may be just paying attention for the first time, but that's a limited area that was designated, and it's not a gamble citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7275)|
| 2:01:24| It is a targeted new type of housing that we're implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| I think I heard some – I guess, Mr. Sale, I would ask you to come back up if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| I don't want to speak for all of my colleagues, but I feel confident that none of us want to make housing any more affordable than it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| In fact, this council and this administration has acted in a number of ways to make housing as much affordable as we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7303)|
| 2:01:53| With that said, I think I heard arguments on both sides tonight for some of the speakers that this would actually make housing more unaffordable or displace folks more than we're already seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7313)|
| 2:02:04| Can you tell us – I think you – I can feel confident in saying you know more about the housing data and the housing market here than most of the folks I know in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7324)|
| 2:02:15| Can you talk about what the data shows as it relates to housing affordability before and after missing middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| Yeah. I mean fundamentally, when you look back historically, which I think is the important part of this, when you look at housing completions in general as a share of the number of households you have, which is really the metric you need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7342)|
| 2:02:36| We've been – we've slowly been building less and less and less, and so there's – part of this is just a supply problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7356)|
| 2:02:46| I mean when you look at the rental vacancy rate, it's been hovering around 98 percent, which is virtually full when you talk about tenant turnover, that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7366)|
| 2:02:55| I mean 100 percent occupancy rate is not really feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| And then even on the homeowner-occupied side, the housing stock were up in probably 97 percent, and generally speaking, a healthy rental occupancy rate, you want like 95 percent is what the metric is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7379)|
| 2:03:15| And so what's been interesting is looking at some of the data on the other cities who have been working on missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| Minneapolis went a little bit farther, but what you've seen – what was very particularly interesting is the city of Minneapolis made some changes and the suburbs did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7401)|
| 2:03:31| So similar to what we're doing, and there was a really interesting analysis just published in a journal a few days ago showing that rent growth within the city limits was actually stalling fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7411)|
| 2:03:45| It was falling back down to about one percent year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| Places outside of that in the suburbs were still seeing double-digit rent increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| So I mean part of this is finding a way to increase housing supplies, particularly in a way that is sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7433)|
| 2:04:01| And part of the affordability thing that we have not considered or don't talk about is 41 percent of people in the city of Knoxville consist of one person living alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7441)|
| 2:04:14| And a huge part of the affordability factor is you need a smaller unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| And when you look at the size of our – and the composition of our housing stock today, a very small percentage of our housing stock is that one, two-bedroom size housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7459)|
| 2:04:32| And so essentially people have to pay more because their only option is a two-, three-, four-bedroom despite whether they need that much space or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7472)|
| 2:04:41| And so one critical piece of this is just that by nature – or by virtue of the fact that these are going to be smaller units, they're relatively affordable compared to a single-family home that might have a much larger square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7481)|
| 2:04:57| And hopefully that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| Thank you, Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| Oh, Mr. Roberto, you were next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| Piggybacking on some of the discussion points that were just discussed and just kind of going into a little bit more detail, Ms. Ball, we talked about – when you and I were talking last, we talked about infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7508)|
| 2:05:19| So – and we discussed just a moment ago about where, you know, infrastructure was and why it was – why the TDR was selected for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7519)|
| 2:05:33| But my question for you is outside of the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| Is this plan appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| Is this proposal appropriate outside of the TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| This plan was developed specifically for the geography inside of the TDR and the somewhat consistent composition of the neighborhoods within the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7545)|
| 2:06:01| When you go outside of the TDR, of course there are some neighborhoods that are similar outside of the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7561)|
| 2:06:08| But a large portion of the city of Knoxville outside of that geography is going to look and feel and have a very different character and composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7568)|
| 2:06:20| And therefore would probably need – we would probably need a pretty different plan to execute this exact same thing across a broader cross-section of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7580)|
| 2:06:32| It would have to look pretty different than what this plan is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| Just as an example, this was really – lots of thought was put into maintaining the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7598)|
| 2:06:47| And there's lots of opportunities in this plan to do that very thing that might not fit outside of that TDR geography and might not maintain neighborhood consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7607)|
| 2:06:59| So it would require us to look at it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| And that fit and consistency is really – a lot of focus is on what the infrastructure looks like in that area outside of the TDR. Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7622)|
| 2:07:13| Well, that's an additional issue, yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Okay. And are there any plans to expand this proposal outside of the TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| And I wanted to get into the things you had seen in similar communities that have implemented this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7645)|
| 2:07:33| Where did you end up seeing most of the activity when you looked at other cities that have done missing metal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7653)|
| 2:07:44| I would absolutely call on my colleagues with planning who have also done a significant amount of research to feel like they could chime in on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7664)|
| 2:07:53| The key thing that what we have heard from other cities that has happened is that it's been very incremental in the speed at which this type of housing begins to take place in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7673)|
| 2:08:10| It isn't a significant rush of this type of housing. It does happen in an incremental way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| Some cities have had very different composition than we do and had much larger geographies of vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7696)|
| 2:08:28| Certainly vacant lots are clearly an easy and natural target for this type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7708)|
| 2:08:36| Any type of housing, really, inside of any geographic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| So that's definitely where you're going to see a component of this, but I don't know that we could say that it would be there exclusively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7721)|
| 2:08:50| Do you have anything, Ms. Brooks or Ms. Crockett, to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7730)|
| 2:08:56| I would just echo we did an extensive amount of research on state enabling legislations, municipalities nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7736)|
| 2:09:06| and then similar cities in the southeast that have adopted these types of code amendments and everything that Ms. Ball said is spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| What we've found in all these municipalities is that it is generally incremental change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| even when most of these code adoptions have been citywide instead of in specific land use areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| There are situations where extenuating circumstances can delay their rollout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| So a lot of these were adopted around 2019, 2020. So the pandemic tended to slow the numbers down even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| So middle housing forms are going to be subject to the exact same things that all of the construction industry is subject to, costs, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7776)|
| 2:09:43| And then the other sort of major takeaway that we found in these is that having a clear and efficient process with a staff process is a critical aspect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7783)|
| 2:09:53| But in general, it was incremental change, even in the municipalities that adopted it citywide, which was most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7793)|
| 2:10:00| And so from the beginning of this process, when we were going through the workshops and starting this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| this always seemed to me like what was being attempted was a focus on infill housing, primarily looking at what was going to happen in vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7807)|
| 2:10:16| Is that panning out a lot? I mean, based on what you just said, it sounds like that's what's been happening in your research, but just wanted to see if that was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7816)|
| 2:10:27| In general, I would say yes. The data, I will say that might just be based on the data that's captured, because a lot of it is based on building permit data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7827)|
| 2:10:38| So when someone is building something new, there are at least in the city of Minneapolis from 2020 to 2022, there is a certain amount of duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7838)|
| 2:10:49| It was actually half and half. So there were, for example, 64 duplexes that were permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| Those were 33 new builds and then 31 existing buildings that were converted. So it was a mixed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7854)|
| 2:11:01| Once you go up to triplexes, there were 14 new ones permitted and then seven existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| So it sort of decreases as the forms get larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| Thank you, Mr. Crockett. Just as a point of information, that was Minneapolis you were just citing, which is a much bigger city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7870)|
| 2:11:19| I mean, I just think it's important that this is all giving property owners more options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| Property owners still can do nothing with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| They can leave it as a vacant lot or whatever current buildings on it, or they can build a single family detached home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7889)|
| 2:11:36| And same with the parking restrictions. Those are just eliminating the minimum requirements or reducing them in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7896)|
| 2:11:44| But if a property owner is like, well, I want to build a duplex and have four parking spots, they're still allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7904)|
| 2:11:51| It gives them the options to exceed the minimums, but it doesn't require them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7911)|
| 2:11:59| So I think that's just something important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| And also as bold as this may be, the studies that we've done of other cities, the change is pretty incremental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7921)|
| 2:12:10| And also our geographic area is, you know, limited to the traditional neighborhood zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7930)|
| 2:12:16| which we thought based on our studies was best fitting with the infrastructure, as Mr. Roberto also noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7936)|
| 2:12:24| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| Thank you, Mayor. I first want to say that we're all smart enough here to hold two thoughts in our mind at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7946)|
| 2:12:37| You can think that middle housing is good and you can also be a little worried about what it might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| So I don't want us to cast aspersions on our friends and neighbors that have different viewpoints on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7963)|
| 2:12:54| Most things in life are not either all good or all bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| So I just kind of want that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| I think that middle housing is a good thing, but there are things that scare me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| And I think people who have bought into a neighborhood thinking it's going to be one way and all of a sudden it's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7985)|
| 2:13:13| It's not unreasonable for them to be concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| That's their largest investment they have ever made in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| And it's not something that we should rather cavalierly dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8002)|
| 2:13:29| Now, the preaching has stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| So what I will say is one of the things that concerns me a little bit about this is I know we can make changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8013)|
| 2:13:42| but a year's a long time to hear how things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| And once a project starts, you don't stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| So, I mean, I would be very interested to see, you know, six months just to touch base with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8031)|
| 2:14:00| I know planning required a year, but I think as a council person, if this passes, I would like some feedback in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8040)|
| 2:14:09| How's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| Are we seeing any uptick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| What are the problems we're running into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| Because I would rather fix it sooner than a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| We can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| I just think it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| And especially knowing that one of the concerns I think our citizens have when we make these kind of changes is how do we know what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8065)|
| 2:14:34| Like with the ADU thing, you know, we don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| There wasn't a system in place when we started counting them, so we're not real sure how many we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| So I'm very pleased to hear that, you know, building permits will help us tell the tale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| What I think I just heard you say, though, is a conversion to a duplex would require nobody knowing anything because that's just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8092)|
| 2:15:01| Well, there's a lot of permits that you would need to pull to get the fire things ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| So the permits will still be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| And, you know –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| People in neighborhoods need to understand that because I think what people don't want to wake up to is one day something going on next door that they had no idea was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8108)|
| 2:15:20| So it doesn't mean that I think middle housing is a bad thing, but I think we have to respect the fact that we've had single-family housing for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8120)|
| 2:15:29| Most everybody living now that owns a home, that's what they bought into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8129)|
| 2:15:34| That's what we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| I do think traditional neighborhoods, this is the right place to start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| I think it meets the character of what was there before, but I can understand why people are concerned how this will change what they bought into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8140)|
| 2:15:52| And so I just want us to be very cognizant that if this passes, that we are looking at this in six months, sort of on a rolling six-month basis to see if it's getting out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8152)|
| 2:16:04| Yes, I'm happy to provide such an update every six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| As long as I'm there, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Yeah, I'm going to try and do as many things as I can in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| First off, I want to say one of the reasons that I voted to hear from all the speakers, I just want to point out to my colleagues, there are a number of people sitting out there that live in the neighborhoods in my district that didn't get to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8178)|
| 2:16:32| We heard from some people that didn't, that were in favor, but I wanted everyone to know there are people that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| Mr. Schell, so I'm actually going to call on you, so if you want to start making your way to the mic, because I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| Cheryl Ball and Ms. Brooks, I have a question real quick while he's making his way to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8204)|
| 2:16:52| In section 46G, administrative variations, variances, and appeals, there's part one, and there's A, and within A, there's little lowercase letter I, double I, triple I, and then four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8212)|
| 2:17:10| I guess it's lowercase, Roman numeral four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| Front setbacks, a decrease in minimum front setbacks up to 50% provided the setback is consistent with the, one of the questions sent to us is should that be block face instead of neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8232)|
| 2:17:26| Because what is the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| The way that we use our terminology and all the things we adopted in recode is block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| Yes, Councilmember, we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| It should be block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| That would make more sense in the way we measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| In just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| I'm not going to use my five minutes to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| Mr. Schell, so you and I had a conversation about banking the other day, because I don't know as much about it as my colleague, Councilwoman Fugitt, and so I had to, and I can't talk to her about these issues because we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8265)|
| 2:17:58| One of the big concerns out of a lot of people is that missing middle housing all ends up being rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| And my questions to you were how does one sell a piece or a portion if it's a quad, a tri, a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8283)|
| 2:18:12| So could you, for the record, help everyone understand what you told me is that these could be sellable units, not necessarily rentals to bring new neighbors in that are owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8292)|
| 2:18:23| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| Nathaniel Schelso, 237 Denerick Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| We were discussing some of the financing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, they support one to four family houses being sold to owner-occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8310)|
| 2:18:38| You can actually count income in the additional units towards that owner-occupant's purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8318)|
| 2:18:45| So there's that aspect of promoting ownership within these types of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| But then additionally, they can be condoed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| Our state has a law that allows them to be condoed out as small as a duplex up to an unlimited number, and it's a pretty standard law that was passed in 2008 to kind of bring in some uniformity to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8333)|
| 2:19:12| Basically, it just makes a small miniature homeowner's association between two people, and then one half can be sold off individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8352)|
| 2:19:23| So it's not just rentals that can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| They can become owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| So you could have a duplex, and you have two different owners because they're owning each one of the condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| And then the other thing you and I discussed, because I confirmed it with you because I heard it in a podcast, was let's say someone wants to buy their first home, and it happens to be a duplex or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8374)|
| 2:19:46| They can get an FHA loan for a duplex or something larger, and it's a 3.5% down payment with a credit score of 580 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8386)|
| 2:20:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| So that's one program, an FHA loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| But also Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have conventional loan programs where you can go down to 5%, which doesn't have the mortgage insurance aspect that FHA does long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8404)|
| 2:20:16| But, yeah, there are multiple low down payment options to get ownership in these types of structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8416)|
| 2:20:23| And those with veterans' benefits can do –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| They can get up to 100, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8427)|
| 2:20:28| 100%, so a 0% down payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| So just by creating more housing types, there's more places for people to rent, but there's other options for somebody that doesn't want to own a large home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8431)|
| 2:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| My time is going to wind out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| I'm going to make a motion to amend 4.6.G1-A, Roman numeral lowercase 4, to say front setbacks, a decrease in minimum front setbacks up to 50% provided the setback is consistent with the block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8447)|
| 2:21:09| So the word neighborhood becomes block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| Motion to amend from the word neighborhood to block face per what she just said has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| I mean, I couldn't repeat what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| Does anybody have any questions about this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| It was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| Ms. McKenzie, is your question about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| So let's vote on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| I think Mr. Smith did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| All those in favor of this language change, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| The amendment carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| Now back to the original motion, Council Member McKenzie, and then we'll go to Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| In our packet, in the map that we see that's highlighted, which are the, and there's some shaded that are the vacant lots, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8512)|
| 2:22:02| Ms. Brooks, are the shaded lots in the map vacant lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| Or Ms. Crockett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| Is that the one on the last page of the packet from Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| Is it titled R and 1 zoning districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| This map just highlights in the gray area, that's the TDR, the vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8537)|
| 2:22:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8548)|
| 2:22:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8549)|
| 2:22:30| I have a hard time reading this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8550)|
| 2:22:31| Where is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| I get older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| You have outlined the TDR, and then you have highlighted here, this is specifically to call out the R and 1 zone properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8553)|
| 2:22:40| and then it also identifies which of those R and 1s are vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| So specific to R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| How many inches is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| Gosh, it's like 700 and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| Mine popped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| My question is, do we know, based on that map, what percentage of those are private property-owned lots versus city-owned lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8571)|
| 2:23:04| Do we have that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| We do not have that information readily available tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| It's something that we could look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| We could probably get that between first and second reading, if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| That would be good for us to know in looking at the map and these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| I'd like to know that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| Ms. Brooks, is that the map that you emailed to me today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8601)|
| 2:23:29| No, Councilwoman, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Because I've asked Mr. Johnson to send that map to all my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| Councilmember McKenzie, do you have more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| Just to highlight one of the things that Councilman Fugate said about people want visibility to this and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8623)|
| 2:23:52| Given that the only kind of technically missing middle area in the city we have now is in the South Waterfront, it's a good case study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8632)|
| 2:24:00| And one of the things that we've asked the administration to do, and they have obliged last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8640)|
| 2:24:07| was to create a website so you can see all of the permits or the developments that are before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8647)|
| 2:24:13| that are happening in the missing middle kind of South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| So the desire to see what's new is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8656)|
| 2:24:22| And I think somebody else mentioned, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| the lack of our ability to enforce short-term rentals highlights the concern people have for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8664)|
| 2:24:37| There's evidence that we have trouble enforcing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8677)|
| 2:24:43| So I guess this may be a little bit odd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| but given how many permits have been requested this year and last year and continue to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8688)|
| 2:24:54| and our ability to kind of adapt to those, and given the new design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8694)|
| 2:25:02| do we have the staff required to handle these new reviews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| And same question for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| I don't want to start something without the capacity required to review it, enforce it, and monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8711)|
| 2:25:18| Vice Mayor Smith, I would just say that's one of the reasons that we kept this to the traditional neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| because there's already the review staff in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| And that's my understanding that we, and also you all have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| given the administration more means to improve things on the software end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| and more reviewers for, you know, plans, reviews, and inspections and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| We've been able to update our permit fees, so we'll be able to hire more staff on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| So, yeah, we will have enough staff to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| And, again, we do anticipate, based on the experience of all the other cities across the country who have done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8750)|
| 2:25:56| that, you know, this is not going to be like a crushing, you know, avalanche of new things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8756)|
| 2:26:04| We think that we'll change and help things, but that we'll be able to do it within the existing staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| And question for you, Ms. Brooks, or Ms. Ball, whichever would like to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| but, you know, the additional on-street parking may be new to some neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8775)|
| 2:26:21| Can you talk about safety associated with on-street parking in neighborhoods versus, you know, the lack of safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8781)|
| 2:26:29| To whom are you asking the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| I'll start with Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| On-street parking, we've discussed this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| but some neighborhoods may not be as welcoming or used to on-street parking that's going to be encouraged by some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8795)|
| 2:26:44| Is on-street parking safer or less safe for residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8804)|
| 2:26:51| Is there data behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| So I can start off and provide an answer from the planning perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| but I might defer to my colleagues in the Department of Engineering to talk specifically about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| I'm sure it's very specific to the context that you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| But in terms of from a high-level planning perspective, on-street parking can be very safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8828)|
| 2:27:14| It does provide traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| It slows down traffic on neighborhood streets because it provides a national buffer to sidewalks where sidewalks are existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8837)|
| 2:27:26| So in our mind, yes, it can be very, very safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| But I would defer to the Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| I'll give an even more unequivocal answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| On-street parking slows people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Speed kills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| And when you have more cars parked on the street, it slows people down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| and so there are a lot fewer crashes that cause injury or death, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| There's a lot of studies that show it, and we experience that with our crash data here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| So it will be an adjustment to some neighborhoods for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8874)|
| 2:27:58| but one of the happy adjustments will be fewer injuries and deaths, which is a good outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8878)|
| 2:28:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| And I guess for Ms. Crockett, design standards, can you discuss, just review again how that will be handled for these new developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8887)|
| 2:28:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| So do you mean design standards for the buildings or for parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| So we have planning has standardized review processes for all development review from the EN zone, DKE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8903)|
| 2:28:32| to the overlays like historic and infill overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| So we'll have a process to review those, including an application form and a checklist for supporting documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8915)|
| 2:28:42| like the site plan and elevation drawings that should be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| We have a section of design standards related to broader elements, such as roof lines, building walls, front facade details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8926)|
| 2:28:57| and then elements like orientation to the street, so how the fronts of these buildings relate to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8937)|
| 2:29:03| And we'll verify all these through the site plan and elevation review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| And I'll say currently our practice is on the back end when these drawings are submitted as construction drawings to permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8947)|
| 2:29:14| planning staff also reviews the construction drawings that are submitted that the inspectors then go out and inspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8954)|
| 2:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| And unlike short term rentals, we catch these things on the front end, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| We're able to catch these during the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| As much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| These require construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| So I'm not sure who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Council Member Roberto, then we'll go to Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| Obviously, you know, addressing the housing crisis means increasing the supply of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| We've had a lot of discussions here at council about that demand is way outside of what supply is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8987)|
| 2:29:54| And so what I think you're what is being attempted here is to increase supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| Just kind of a review of some of the things we've heard already tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| The TDR, which is where this is located, is appropriate for this proposal because of the infrastructure that exists there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| The plan doesn't work in areas without existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| And we talked about what that infrastructure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| We've seen an incremental change that has occurred in other communities that have adopted this, not a significant rush to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9023)|
| 2:30:33| When they were reviewing the data they saw, they were seeing more infill on vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9033)|
| 2:30:39| They're not seeing an increase in demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| I was very glad to hear the discussion just a moment ago about expanded ownership options because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9042)|
| 2:30:49| we shouldn't be disparaging any type of housing because we need a diversity of housing to solve the housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9049)|
| 2:30:59| So we wouldn't want anyone to come and talk about one type of housing or another and say one is bad, one is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9059)|
| 2:31:07| We need all of them to solve this in that in that same light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9067)|
| 2:31:14| We wouldn't want to talk. We also want to make sure there are opportunities for ownership, because for most folks, I know for myself, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9074)|
| 2:31:25| as an example, my single biggest investment is a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| And I'm sure most people that there's a lot of that that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| If we don't have opportunities for ownership, then what we're going to do is start seeing folks slip further back with wealth cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9094)|
| 2:31:42| And so we've got to have those ownership opportunities. So I do see that as a good as a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9102)|
| 2:31:48| And I was glad to hear that discussion. You know, the proposal by itself is not going to solve the housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9108)|
| 2:31:56| And no one's really argued that, which is good because it won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9116)|
| 2:32:03| There's been a lot of time and resources put into this ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| And I think it's a step towards increasing diversity of housing options and the additional units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| the additional supply that we need when I when I started talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| But we need a multifaceted approach, which we heard from some of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| And I know we've we've heard about that here at council as well in our many discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| And there's a lot of recommendations in the Opticus report that talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9148)|
| 2:32:33| And so I was glad to hear a lot of discussion from, you know, folks in the audience as well as council at different times in our workshops and otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9153)|
| 2:32:42| that we've got to be doing this and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| And the one thing that I think we need to make sure we mention is the mixed use on the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9165)|
| 2:32:53| And that's an important piece in what Opticus brought with the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| It's an important piece to what we need to be doing, because there there's a lot of there's a lot of opportunity along the corridors for increased units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9178)|
| 2:33:09| for supply, for building in more walkable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| And we really need to have a focus on addressing that as well and addressing that in a big, bold way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9194)|
| 2:33:23| I think not just one thing at a time, but looking at a lot and moving on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| I think there's a lot of interest out there in doing mixed use on the corridor, not only on the corridors, not only from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9209)|
| 2:33:40| but also from developers and folks that want to start building supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| So this is a step. There's big steps that we also need to be taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9225)|
| 2:33:51| And I hope that we will be seeing a lot of activity and energy and resources put into mixed use along the commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9231)|
| 2:34:00| Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Press your mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9240)|
| 2:34:09| I will just echo what my colleagues said. It won't surprise anybody that I'm a big fan of exploring the potential in the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9249)|
| 2:34:17| And to me, that's where the really significant opportunities are to really increase significantly housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9257)|
| 2:34:26| And we can really be a transformational city if we do that and do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| The whole idea of building housing where the infrastructure is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9272)|
| 2:34:39| The people who live there will have ready access to businesses to be customers at businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9279)|
| 2:34:45| They'll have opportunities for employment right there, and it will lessen some of the less worthy aspects of more density than a neighborhood can tolerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9285)|
| 2:35:00| So we need a balance. But I appreciate my colleagues comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| And I'll be glad to really start focusing on on the corridors and what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9307)|
| 2:35:14| The other thing is all the blight that's on the corridors is just begging to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9314)|
| 2:35:20| And having said that, I know it's not going to be easy because it's going to be a bit of a paradigm shift of something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9320)|
| 2:35:28| because Rico just relatively recently has opened up corridors to opportunities for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9328)|
| 2:35:36| So we want to engage the developers, see what incentives we may need to do to have them to do to look more closely at the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9336)|
| 2:35:47| It's not going to be easy. There's there's obstacles in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| Property on the corridors is a lot more expensive in some regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| But if you look, for example, you've heard me talk about Broadway. You drive up Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| There's property for sale on Broadway. There is retail that's gone out of business. A lot of it's not coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9360)|
| 2:36:09| There's these big swaths of parking lots that could be used for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9369)|
| 2:36:15| So anyway, that's that's the next step. And I want to see us approach that aggressively and with a real fervor for taking the best, making the best out of that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9375)|
