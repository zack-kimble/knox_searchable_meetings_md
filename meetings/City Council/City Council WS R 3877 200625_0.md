| 0:03:41| Vice Mayor McKenzie for setting this up I really appreciate the opportunity to present our five year consolidated plan, and one year annual action plan, and I appreciate all of you attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=221)|
| 0:03:55| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| I know there's a lot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| But we feel like it's important for you to understand this really important process that our department's been through through the last year, and get a better understanding of how we do work in the housing and neighborhood development department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=240)|
| 0:04:16| Before I start I wanted to introduce some staff people who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| But Stephanie cooks on the call she's the disability services coordinator for our department and she is the ADA coordinator for the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=262)|
| 0:04:34| Mike Dunthorne is the homeless services coordinator. He's on the call. Ken McMahon has joined us he's our economic and community development manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=274)|
| 0:04:47| And I wanted to introduce our new housing manager, who is Beth bacon. She's been with us a week and a half now, and she is replacing Jana Cecil who's retired after many years of a successful career with the city so we're really pleased to have Beth join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=287)|
| 0:05:05| she's worked for over 20 years with KCDC, and we're glad to have her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| I also want to recognize Linda rust this community development administrator and her team, who consists of hope Ely the senior project specialist CC Henderson office assistant and RT McBride and intern, and they have really been responsible for this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=312)|
| 0:05:33| planning process, which started a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| Despite a pandemic, and the computer shut down over the last two weeks, they've been able to get things up and completed, and the plans are now posted on our website, and we'll be up for 30 days for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=339)|
| 0:05:55| I also want to give a big shout out and thank you to hopefully for putting this PowerPoint together for us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=355)|
| 0:06:03| She did a great job on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| So without further ado, we'll go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| So our mission in housing and community and neighborhood development is to revitalize low and moderate income communities and strengthen all city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| And we do this by working with community partners on many programs with various sources of funding, federal, state and local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=380)|
| 0:06:32| Our mission this evening is to go over the consolidated plan will review the process, which began about a year ago with community engagement and outreach will review HUD funding, and our regulatory and budgetary constraints with the money that we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=392)|
| 0:06:54| goals and objectives for the next five years and those are based on citizen input data, and the information from our agency partners that we gathered over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=414)|
| 0:07:07| And we'll talk about some other information impacting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| We engaged in an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| We contracted with an agency farmer Morgan to complete that document, and we'll talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=437)|
| 0:07:26| And then of course coven 19, and the funds that have come to the city. As a result of the cares act have added some resources for us to be able to do some additional things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=446)|
| 0:07:41| And then we'll present the annual action plan and that is basically what we intend to do with our first year funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| We only get our funding on an annual basis so we can only plan out projects and activities one year at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| And we'll talk about the timeline, and then how you can comment and how you can ask your constituents to comment on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=476)|
| 0:08:06| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| So the consolidated plan is a very comprehensive document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| It's required to be presented to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for any jurisdiction that receives federal community planning and development funds directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=493)|
| 0:08:26| Those include community development block grant or CDBG home investment partnership program funds or home and emergency solutions grants or ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=506)|
| 0:08:39| We must complete this planning process every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| This one will begin July 1 2020 and and June 30 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| It is a strategic plan for our department. There are no funds attached to it. It's a planning document, and the funding document is the annual plan that gets updated every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=531)|
| 0:09:06| It requires extensive community engagement and like I said we started a year ago with that process with public participation as well as consultation with our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=546)|
| 0:09:20| It sets our goals and high and low priority objectives for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| And it also informs local funding priorities and a really good example of this is the development of the Affordable Rental Development Fund or ARDF to help incentivize new affordable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=565)|
| 0:09:42| Those funds came to be because of a need identified through our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=582)|
| 0:09:53| So I am going to turn it over to Linda Rust and let her talk for a little bit so you won't get tired of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=593)|
| 0:10:01| Just quickly this is Amelia before Linda begins. Did you say the five year plan is available online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| Yes, it was posted yesterday. It will be posted for 30 days for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| And can you help me find where to locate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Yes, it is on our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| If you go to KnoxvilleTN.gov and then departments you can find it under housing and neighborhood development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=624)|
| 0:10:37| You have to kind of scroll down but it should be below or beside the gray box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| Good evening Council. I want to talk to you a little bit about the community engagement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| Becky just introduced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| We met with the Neighborhood Advisory Council about this time last year and asked for their guidance and how we could get more feedback and more people involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=658)|
| 0:11:12| So they were a key partner with us throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| The first thing that we did was we did an online survey. We put that up. We had a kickoff and then to kind of draw attention to that so people would know where to find that survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=677)|
| 0:11:28| And then we also partnered with SEED to go door-to-door with that same survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| So between those two efforts we got almost 500 responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And then we were also able to put that survey into a PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| And many of you came to those neighborhood and community meetings that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| We did four around town and then we did a couple of meetings, one in the morning and one in the evening so that we could be accessible to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=712)|
| 0:12:01| And we got about 129 responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| So all told we had over 600 responses to our online survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| But at these community meetings we were also able to take feedback that wasn't necessarily a response to a survey but where they could actually give their own feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=730)|
| 0:12:22| And then we had some consultation meetings with key groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| We met with the Next Step Initiative with some people who were experiencing homelessness, street homelessness in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| We did a focus group with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| We met with the Youth Advisory Board and that is a group of youth and young people who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| We had focus groups with seniors over at the O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| We met at a retreat that the Council on Disability Issues, CODI, was having to talk to people who have disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=772)|
| 0:13:01| We had an affordable housing developers meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| And they're kind of slipping my mind now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| There were a lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| We had 11 meetings and had almost 150 people responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| We also met in Lawndale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| And we had a Spanish speaking meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| So that was interesting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| And we were able to get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| For those groups that either could not meet with us or just the timing was hard over the summer, we had a questionnaire too to try to get at some specific feedback about what they saw as needs in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=804)|
| 0:13:42| We also gathered some data from the American Community Survey and from 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| It was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| So all of that was in preparation for Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Will, if you don't mind advancing the presentation, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| So Phase 2 was where we got feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| We presented all of that information that we had, the results of all that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| And the initial data that corroborated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| And then we met with the Neighborhood Advisory Council again in November to really present it to them and give them kind of a first opportunity to help us add to that and give us some of their responses to that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=852)|
| 0:14:29| And then we prepared and held a public meeting in January and presented all of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| We had boards that had the different charts showing the feedback from the surveys and assembled that into a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| And that is also available on our webpage that Becky was talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| So you can find the results of that and how we conducted that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| And then Phase 3 was probably the most difficult part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| That was drafting the plan and putting all of that information together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| And even under normal circumstances, it's a lot of work to try to gather all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| And there's a template that HUD provides on how to answer all these questions, and they give you tables of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=911)|
| 0:15:20| So it was sort of a combination of adding to their questions and answering their questions in the tables that they provided with our local data and the local feedback that we got from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=920)|
| 0:15:32| And then in the middle of all that, we had the shutdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| And so we had all these other sources of funding coming at us that you all are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| And so we kind of put this on the back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| HUD also gave us an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Normally, our deadline is May 15th to turn this in, but they gave us an extension until next year, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| But we don't want to wait until next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| We want to get this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| But putting all of that together and finalizing it, that's what we've been doing for the last probably three to four months and released that draft yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=959)|
| 0:16:10| And if you can advance the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| Phase 4 is where we are now, and that's where we want to get feedback on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| And under normal circumstances, we usually have, we release the draft, and then we have the public comment period, and then we report back on all of that feedback that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=980)|
| 0:16:31| So we're doing a little bit backwards this time, but I think it really probably works well for us to introduce the consolidated plan really with this meeting that is accessible for people to watch on the TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=991)|
| 0:16:44| And then have the 30 days in front of us so that people can ask questions and give input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| So this is really kind of an introduction to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| So we'll present just a little bit of information about the consolidated plan and really spend a little bit more time working on talking about the one-year action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1014)|
| 0:17:05| And that's the plan that really has money to it and where we can say that these are specific things that we want to work on during the next year, starting July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1025)|
| 0:17:15| And we also want your feedback, so we encourage you on council or anyone watching to ask questions and give us your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1035)|
| 0:17:27| Phase 5 is where we're going next, so we'll consider the public comments that we receive and revise the plan as we can based on the feedback that we get from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1047)|
| 0:17:38| And then Becky will send you an email before the council meeting where you'll be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1058)|
| 0:17:47| You have to approve this before we can send it to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| So she'll update you on the public comments that we received and if we made any changes, if we did it and why we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| So we want you to be fully informed of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| And then we'll come before you on July 28, I guess within a few days of our public comment period ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1081)|
| 0:18:10| And we'll come to you and update you and ask for your support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| And then after that, and after you approve that, then we can turn it into HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| And that goes into a system called IDIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| And then it'll be a lot shorter than the consolidated plan that you'll see on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| We tried to make it accessible for people to understand all the different charts and tried to make it as accessible as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1113)|
| 0:18:44| But we're limited in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| And, of course, there's a lot of things that we don't have to explain to HUD because this is their process and their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| But what we submit will be just a very brief part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Becky, did you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| I'm visible now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| So I'd like to talk a little bit about some of the constraints we have with the money that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| We get three different programs funded to the city directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| That's CDBG, Community Development Block Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| And although these funds are fairly flexible, they have to be focused on some particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| So they are intended to provide decent housing, create a suitable living environment, or create economic opportunities, specifically for low and moderate income people, households, or areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1171)|
| 0:19:47| The HOME funds that we receive are really Home Investment Partnerships Program funds, and it's short for that is HOME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| Those are focused solely on housing improvements, either through development of homeownership or affordable rental housing for low and very low income persons or households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1194)|
| 0:20:11| And then our Emergency Solutions Grants are focused on programs serving people who are in danger or experiencing homelessness, in danger of homelessness or experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1211)|
| 0:20:25| And so those can be focused on street outreach, emergency shelter, homelessness prevention, rapid rehousing, or homeless management information systems assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1225)|
| 0:20:40| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| So here's a little graph of our budgetary constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| As you can see, CDBG started in the late 80s, and then HOME started in the early 90s, and you can see how that it's went up a little long time ago, but it's been steadily declining for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1245)|
| 0:21:06| We've had a little bit of an uptick in the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| But because Congress has to vote to appropriate this funding every year, we never know from year to year what we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| It is based on a formula. However, they have to vote on the overall pot of money, and then that all gets divided up between all the jurisdictions across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1281)|
| 0:21:31| So that's why it varies so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| But we're really glad that the city has stepped up, particularly on development of affordable rental housing several years ago with ARDF funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1294)|
| 0:21:45| And you can see the allocation we've received in our department since 2017 for those funds, and those have helped fill in where we have lost a lot of the federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1305)|
| 0:21:58| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Okay, so for this coming year, we do know what amount of money we're going to be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| The CDBG is at 1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| That is a 4% increase from the year we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Our HOME funds will be at 1.15, which is a 10% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| Our emergency solutions grants are at 148,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| That's a decrease, but we're getting those directly now from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| We were getting those from the state for the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| However, as you all know, we have received quite a lot of COVID funding through the CARES Act to fund our emergency solutions grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1355)|
| 0:22:45| We have received quite a lot of COVID funding through the CARES Act to focus on homeless issues, and we are anticipating another gigantic amount of funding in that category in the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1365)|
| 0:23:01| We are going to have a big process, and we'll talk about that a little bit more later, but for us to receive 2.2 million in emergency solutions grants is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1381)|
| 0:23:19| Typically, we receive around 150,000 annually, and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| And then city local funds that we use are affordable rental development fund, like I talked about, and then homeless agency grants, which are city operating funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1406)|
| 0:23:38| And then there's some other funds, of course, that we administer in our department that we're not even covering here, such as commercial facade, blighted properties, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1418)|
| 0:23:51| Okay, I think you're on, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| So what we learned out of our community engagement process was that there are four key areas that are important to Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1435)|
| 0:24:06| The first was reducing and preventing homelessness, stabilize and revitalize neighborhoods, creating economic opportunity, and enhancing the availability, accessibility, and quality of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1446)|
| 0:24:23| So we use our HUD funds to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| We use the local city of Knoxville funds, and we also will be using the CARES Act funds in those areas as well, and we will talk a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1468)|
| 0:24:40| I know you all have been involved in helping to distribute the CARES Act funds with the housing assistance programs and also some emergency shelter uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1480)|
| 0:24:55| Just, I think, the last council meeting, you voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| But we're not going to really talk about those a whole lot this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| In terms of the annual plan, the way that HUD is having us do those programs is actually through a substantial amendment, which you also approved, I think maybe a month or so ago, substantial amendments to our current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1504)|
| 0:25:22| We're at the end of June, but we're still in our current program year, 2019-2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| So they didn't want us to wait and get those programs going with the consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| They wanted us to go ahead and implement those as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| So some of those funds, those funds won't be in what we talk about in the next few slides, but we definitely tried to accommodate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| Each of them, each of the programs that have come out of those COVID funds fit these categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1549)|
| 0:25:57| If you wouldn't mind advancing the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| So the first goal that we talked about was reducing and preventing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| And what you're going to notice is affordable housing is really a part and one of the objectives of every one of these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1566)|
| 0:26:16| Certainly, we can reduce homelessness and even prevent homelessness if you have affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| So the first objective that we have is to increase affordable permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| And we want to do that through rental housing development and rental housing rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| So that would be existing rental housing that we can improve and just keep in good repair so that it can serve people for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1594)|
| 0:26:47| We want to increase the amount of permanent supportive housing or also rehab or reuse of buildings to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| It doesn't all have to be new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| We want to prevent homelessness and prevent displacement of people through emergency home repair services, through homelessness prevention services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1618)|
| 0:27:10| And the housing payments would be an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| And they are considered a public service under CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| But homelessness prevention is also a category under the EFG funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| Another objective is to connect people to resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| And these are the categories that are part of the housing case management, essential services that include health services, employment and economic stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1645)|
| 0:27:47| Linda, you are, I don't know, is everybody experiencing not hearing her well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1667)|
| 0:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| So I got a message that says low system resources on my quality of my audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Sort of, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Linda, you may want to turn off your video feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| And then the last two are provide emergency shelter, including low barrier shelter, and providing emergency or essential services, including amenities like ways that people can do their laundry and some hygiene type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1706)|
| 0:28:43| So all of those goals and objectives are high priorities, are things that we want to spend our funding on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| And we'll be getting, as Becky said, a lot more EFG funding to help us do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| So we're really grateful for all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| Actually, I'm going to take over because we can't hear you, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Yes, Becky, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I may bring you back in in a minute, if you're working, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| So here's just some logos from some of the partners that we work with currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| And just wanted you to see the different agencies that help us do the work that the city is able to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1770)|
| 0:29:39| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| For permanent supportive housing, this is a new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| You all approved the plan for this at your last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| This is 48 units of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| And we certainly are supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| And we will be bringing another item to you about investing ARDF funds in this project in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1800)|
| 0:30:11| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| So here's some examples of how we prevent displacement through some of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| Our emergency and minor home repairs certainly help keep houses weatherized and in good repair so that people can stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1820)|
| 0:30:31| Also, with our accessibility features through Operation Backyard, they can help people who need access to their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1831)|
| 0:30:40| who've had some sort of accident or illness, be able to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1840)|
| 0:30:50| So our next goal is to stabilize and revitalize neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| And we do that through partnering with our CHODOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| Those are community housing development organizations to develop affordable housing, either homeownership or rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| We provide down payment assistance through our home funds for those homes that are developed by the CHODOs for low income home buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1871)|
| 0:31:22| We prevent displacement through housing rehabilitation, through our own in-house program that does whole house rehabs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| through design and technical assistance to neighborhoods and other groups, and through home-based supportive services for special populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1891)|
| 0:31:42| We also work on blighted properties, not necessarily with federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| But we do support improvements to those blighted properties through our federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| like boarding or mowing the grass, something like that, to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| An objective, we are able to pay for public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| However, that's a low priority since we have other issues and needs in this community that are more pressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| We have those, we have the ability to support those, but those are a low priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| This is an example of an owner-occupied rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| This is done through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| We provide whole house rehabilitation in order to prevent displacement and keep housing affordable for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| We're able to bring the house up to code, make it attractive and energy efficient so that the homeowner can stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1958)|
| 0:32:50| This is an example of design and technical assistance that is provided by the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1970)|
| 0:33:00| The Neighborhood Association approached us about a concept plan for the Burlington Commercial District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1980)|
| 0:33:08| and so we engaged the Design Center to work with the neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| They held several public meetings and came up with a concept plan for the Burlington area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=1994)|
| 0:33:24| so that the community can be ready to move forward with improvements there when funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2004)|
| 0:33:33| We have supported commercial facade improvements in Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| as well as some streetscape improvements that were provided with state and city funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2017)|
| 0:33:48| Our next goal is to create economic opportunity, and we do that on a regular basis through all of our housing programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| because everything that we build or rehab creates construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2036)|
| 0:34:06| Our owner-occupied rehab program particularly helps to support small contractors because they're one house at a time type activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2046)|
| 0:34:18| so we do have a list of contractors that we work with, and we are always interested in having new contractors join our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2058)|
| 0:34:28| We also are interested in creating economic opportunity through training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| We currently support workforce development through neighborhood housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| but we're working with some other organizations for this coming year to develop some other workforce development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| Here's just some examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| The CAC is interested in developing a construction pipeline for the workers that are now doing energy retrofits and housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2100)|
| 0:35:16| to help develop actual small contractors out of workers right now, so we're interested in working with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2116)|
| 0:35:30| Okay, and of course our goal is to enhance the availability, accessibility, and quality of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| We do that once again through new construction and rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| We increase owner-occupied housing through new construction and down payment assistance as well as rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2143)|
| 0:35:52| We increase permanent supportive housing where we can, and we're very happy that VMC is able to develop some housing again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2152)|
| 0:36:03| and then we support energy conservation and efficiency in all of our developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| And although tenant-based rental assistance is an objective, it's a low priority for us since that is managed through KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2170)|
| 0:36:20| and broadband Internet has come up as an objective, but since this community has several providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2180)|
| 0:36:31| really the cost to that is more about getting computers and access into households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2191)|
| 0:36:41| Here's just some examples of new construction homes that were sold through our CHOTO partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2201)|
| 0:36:54| And this is a new construction development, the Village at Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| This is done by HomeSource of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| This is a new affordable rental development that is just finishing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| They would have had a ribbon cutting already, but because of the quarantine, they couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| And this is Southside Flats that's been completed, and they're leasing up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| That's new construction of rental housing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| And here are just a couple other pictures of some housing that's been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| The cottages on Clifton Road is for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| That's developed by KCDC, and then KCDC's starting their Phase 1 redevelopment of Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2257)|
| 0:37:46| The infrastructure's already started, and they will start construction on the housing units later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2266)|
| 0:37:57| So I'm going to see if Linda can jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| I will. Can you hear me now better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Yes, we shut everything down. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| So other information that impacted the consolidated plan included the analysis of impediments to fair housing choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| We call it an AI, and this is a requirement of HUD every time we do a consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2298)|
| 0:38:26| So we worked with a consultant on this, and we're going to have a couple of slides here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| And I don't know if Ben Farmer with Farmer & Morgan has joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| I don't know if you can see him well, but he is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| We'll let him talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Yeah, Linda, he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Excellent. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| We will also talk a little bit about the impacts of COVID-19 and the coronavirus, the shutdown and the economic consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2326)|
| 0:38:57| And then we want to talk a little bit further about some information and the city's continued commitment to equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2337)|
| 0:39:07| If you can advance the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| All right. If Ben is able to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| I am. Thank you, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| So as the slide talks about, the purpose of the analysis of impediments is to identify those impediments within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| and in this case, Knox County as well, that impede fair housing choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| So we begin to evaluate those things from policies within the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| There was a joint AI. We looked through all the laws and regulations as well as any reports and recordings of impediments that have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| And then we had a series of recommendations that were done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| The purpose of the AI is to service the substantive logical basis of fair housing planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| provide essential and detailed information to policymakers, administrative staff, housing providers, lenders and fair housing advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| In addition is to assist in building public support for fair housing efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| We had a series of public meetings over the last year in order to do that, as well as public surveys to receive feedback on what potential impediments might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2405)|
| 0:40:18| The AI involved the assessment of the couple of things I just mentioned, as well as the jurisdictions, laws and regulations, administrative policies, procedures and practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| how the laws affect the location, availability and accessibility of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| And within the draft AI, there are several maps and things that talk about that, specifically about areas that are more affordable than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2430)|
| 0:40:39| and talk about opportunities for low income housing and an ability to provide a fair choice in relation to transportation and other components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2439)|
| 0:40:50| How the laws affect the location, availability and accessibility of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| the conditions of both public and private affected fair housing choice for those protected classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| availability of affordable, accessible housing and a range of unit sizes, which is particularly important, as well as a range of locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| Examination of data regarding the nature and extent of fair housing, any complaints and suits that have taken shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| The 2020 AI identified the following barriers to affordable fair housing within the city of Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| Limited housing stock as well as housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| In other words, the ability of unit types for family sizes, whether that be a smaller single family unit to an apartment, multiple bedrooms, those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2490)|
| 0:41:43| Transportation corridors have connectivity problems and lack of integration with low and moderate income residential areas and employment centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| And that's really an ongoing issue that the city of Knoxville has, as well as other cities across Tennessee and within the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2510)|
| 0:41:59| Mortgage lending practices need to be addressed since there was a high denial rates among certain races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| So we discussed that and make some recommendations. Local higher initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| This is a difficult one, but one that deserves to be looked at again in giving those citizens within the city of Knoxville, Knox County, that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| Lack of trust between the governmental organizations and the community. So that came up within the surveys as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| So we discussed those items and make some recommendations there within the AI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| Thank you, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you, Ben, for sharing that. And we're going to talk a little bit about those recommendations here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| I appreciate you sharing that. I also wanted to share some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| This was interesting, very interesting to us as we've been dealing with the impacts of the virus and the shutdown, the economic consequences of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2567)|
| 0:42:59| And I just wanted to share with you service calls that have actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| Is there a slide right before this one? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| This I want we wanted to show you comparing a year to six months on there, but it's really like five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| But this is from two one one and it's comparing the calls that have come in showing the the huge jump in rent assistance and rent assistance requests and requests for mortgage assistance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2597)|
| 0:43:35| So you can see what kind of comparing the year of twenty nineteen into just the beginning of twenty twenty and then from January through just a couple of weeks ago to show you the volume of calls and the requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2615)|
| 0:43:53| So you all approved the housing assistance program through three agencies with CDBGCV funds and ESGCV funds, I think, about a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2633)|
| 0:44:06| So we wanted to show you some information from that to show you how timely it was to get those funds on the street, out the door to be able to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2646)|
| 0:44:17| And then if you don't mind to go to the next slide now, this shows the same time periods, the volume of calls, housing and shelter that we just broke down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2657)|
| 0:44:27| Also, also calls for for health, health services, health care jumped during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| So we just wanted to share that information with you. And then if you wouldn't mind going to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2676)|
| 0:44:44| So this begins to get at the issues that Ben was just talking about with the A.I. and especially the, you know, like local hiring ability and jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2684)|
| 0:44:56| So I wanted to share this. This is something that we have heard a lot in the last, gosh, probably six or eight months about the disparity in poverty rates, especially especially among black African-American Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2696)|
| 0:45:13| It's about forty two percent poverty rate and they're about 17 percent of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| This was data from 2017 American Community Survey. So we can only imagine how more recent events has impacted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2720)|
| 0:45:32| And we are making a effort to increase the amount of money towards workforce development and in this in this annual action plan and responding to requests in the community and input that we received from the local NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2732)|
| 0:45:57| They were proposing to build capacity within the East Knoxville and Mechanicsville neighborhoods and creating a workforce pipeline, really, for construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2757)|
| 0:46:16| And being that so much of our funds are spent on affordable housing construction with new construction, with rehabilitation, we think this is a really great opportunity and we want to make these workforce development funds more available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2776)|
| 0:46:32| So we have three proposals that we are looking at and we have set aside for this first year three hundred and forty, a little bit more than three hundred and forty thousand to address workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2792)|
| 0:46:51| And if you want to go forward. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Did you want to address this, Becky? Did you want me to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| I'm here. I'm here. Yeah. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| So we mentioned this before and, you know, I know you all have seen this, this because of the CARES Act, we've received additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2824)|
| 0:47:15| Much of this has been allocated already on the housing assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| We received a little over a million dollars in CDBGCV and our first round of ESGCV was at five hundred and thirteen thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2839)|
| 0:47:29| Those have been allocated to housing assistance programs and some other things to specifically help emergent needs under the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2849)|
| 0:47:41| We will be getting two point two million in ESGCV round two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| And now that the consolidated plan is at least posted online and we can take a breath, we'll start working on a process to engage the community in how best this can serve those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2867)|
| 0:48:04| We hope to involve the Community Empowerment Office with us and want to make every effort to reach out to smaller nonprofits and organizations that work with needy populations that possibly have not been able to manage federal funds in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2884)|
| 0:48:28| So we'll be looking at ways that organizations can partner together so that the federal regulations can be met, but those funds can go to smaller grassroots on the ground organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2908)|
| 0:48:46| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| So the annual action plan, and if you say read it online, that's the last about the last 48 pages of the document that was posted yesterday is the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2930)|
| 0:49:01| It's also required by HUD and it is updated annually. Our year one plan is from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2941)|
| 0:49:12| Typically, like Linda said, it's due May 15, but due to the pandemic, they provided an extension to all the jurisdictions across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2952)|
| 0:49:24| We want to go ahead and get it turned in because we can't access the funds until we turn it in. So we will be turning this in once City Council approves it, hopefully, in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2964)|
| 0:49:37| So the action plan is the way we meet the goals and objectives that were laid out in the consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| Like I said earlier, our funding is allocated annually and I gave you those amounts of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| Years two through five update the consolidated plan. So just because there's a priority right now in the consolidated plan, those things can change. Those things can shift as needs shift in the community. We try to be responsive to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=2990)|
| 0:50:08| It also requires community engagement through public participation and consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| And then at the end of every year, we do a report called the CAPER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| And we report back to HUD and the community about how the funds were spent and how we met our accomplishments. And that report is also available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3019)|
| 0:50:33| So this is what our budget looks like for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| I mentioned that we will be getting a federal allocation of 1.7 in CDBG. We have to add in our prior year funds that were not spent, plus our estimated program income that we receive from the loans that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3038)|
| 0:50:56| So our total CDBG funds are $2.1 million. Our home federal allocation is $1.1 million this year. We have prior year funds of $645,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3056)|
| 0:51:10| Plus we have some prior year program income of over $1 million, as well as our estimated program income for the coming year, $500,000. So we have quite a lot of home funds, and that's great. That means more housing that can be rehabbed and redeveloped and developed from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3070)|
| 0:51:34| Our ESG allocation is $148,000. So our total federal fund budget for the next year is $5.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3094)|
| 0:51:45| And then on our, the way we have parsed out our budget, you can see there, I'm not going to read it all because we're getting kind of close on time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3105)|
| 0:51:57| But you can see that most of our budget is on affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| That's still where the need is. The more affordable housing units there are, the less homelessness there is. Neighborhoods are stable, so it affects every one of our priority goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3121)|
| 0:52:17| We've allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| a total of $4.6 million for affordable housing through rental rehab, owner-occupied rehab, CHOTO housing, down payment assistance, and then project delivery pays for our staffing for those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3138)|
| 0:52:35| On homelessness, and this is just the HUD funds for the next year, as you know, and we talked about, we have the COVID money as well as city dollars that also serve homelessness agencies through shelter services and prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3155)|
| 0:52:55| So all of our federal funds are going into rapid rehousing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Neighborhoods, we do property, blighted property stabilization. And as I mentioned, I believe that that pays for mowing of our vacant lots, boarding, any kind of maintenance that we have to do for blighted property prior to sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3181)|
| 0:53:17| And then design and technical assistance that helps organizations, nonprofits, and neighborhood groups. And then Linda mentioned the economic opportunity. We do have funds set aside for workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3197)|
| 0:53:33| And then our administrative costs, that pays for part of our staff at the city, and that's just 6.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3213)|
| 0:53:46| So for our local funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| you can see that our affordable housing, these are city dollars that we're focused on here, with our affordable rental development fund and the Austin Homes redevelopment, as well as the East Tennessee Housing Affordable Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3228)|
| 0:54:06| We are allocating $7 million for affordable housing and city dollars for homelessness, case management, homeless service agency grants, as well as for the day space and assistance to HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3246)|
| 0:54:21| We're providing $762,000 for homeless services. And then for neighborhoods through the community schools program, we're providing $425,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3261)|
| 0:54:32| So, Linda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| So our drafts are now available for review. This is a draft consolidated plan, the strategic, the five-year strategic plan, and then the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3274)|
| 0:54:46| So that is available for public comment for 30 days, June 24th through July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3286)|
| 0:54:54| Just a little bit more than 30 days, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| And then we are going to wrap that up, make whatever resolutions that we come up with available for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| And then we're going to move on to the next item, which is the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| So we're going to move on to the next item, which is the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| And then after you approve that, then we will submit it to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| We don't have a firm deadline for that, but we would like to do it as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| And then the next slide is the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| So we're going to move on to the next item, which is the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| And then after you approve that, then we will submit it to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| We don't have a firm deadline for that, but we would like to do it as soon as possible because a lot of these contracts, you know, we want to have this funding available so that we can pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3339)|
| 0:55:53| And then the next slide is how to find our information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| So a shortcut is KnoxvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| And then the backslash development will take you to our page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| And comments can be sent to me, LRust at KnoxvilleTN.gov, and we'll accept comments through Friday, July 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3366)|
| 0:56:19| You can also call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| My number is 215-2357, 215-2357.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| Even though I'm telecommuting, that will come to my cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| And I prefer that we get comments in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| It's hard if people call me and want to tell me things because I have to try to write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| And it's much better if I can capture exactly what somebody says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| And we don't share names or sometimes not even the organization, but we do share all comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| Every comment that was made throughout this process will be in an attachment that gets sent to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| So I'd prefer if I could get that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| And that way I don't have to try to understand exactly what's being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| You can make your point, and it will be included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| But we really appreciate your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| I'm sorry technology kind of let me down a little bit in being able to help make this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| But we are happy to take your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| I don't know how long your meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| We didn't plan on it taking quite this long for our part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| but we are here at your pleasure to answer whatever questions or take any comments that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| I'm sorry, Becky, there was another part that you wanted to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Yeah, if time allows, I wanted to update everybody on the housing assistance program that was approved with the CARES Act fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3466)|
| 0:57:53| if you're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| I really wasn't sure how long this would be and what the timeframe is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| So, Will, if you have the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| Let me mention something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Vice Mayor McKenzie had to leave the meeting a little bit early, so she asked me to help facilitate us through the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| So, Director Wade, obviously thank you for the presentation, very thorough, and a lot of really good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3496)|
| 0:58:26| Council members, do you want to hear the next part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| I'm certainly willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| I'm seeing yeses, so go ahead, Director Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Will, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| So, next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| We just wanted to give you an update on the number of calls that the agencies that we funded with our CDBG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3526)|
| 0:58:56| and ESGCB funds, where they are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| And so, CAC has received 149 total calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| 80 of those are for rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| They've processed 11 applications, and they have 58 applications pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| Compassion Coalition has received 429 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| 243 for rental assistance, and they've processed 49 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| They also had to train volunteers to help with their phone lines through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| And here again, this is not even a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| This didn't even roll out until June 3rd, so these are the numbers that have come in so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| Is there another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| And then HomeSource, who's providing mortgage assistance to homeowners, have gotten 57 calls or emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3590)|
| 0:59:58| There's a little bit of a time lag for people seeking assistance for mortgages just because foreclosures take longer than evictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3598)|
| 1:00:10| And there was a moratorium on foreclosures for any federally-backed mortgage, so that has not expired yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3610)|
| 1:00:25| But they feel like these will pick up in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| And then, let's see, through 211, they've gotten 657 calls for the housing assistance program, about 50 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3632)|
| 1:00:44| It's tapering off a little bit, but two staff members are dedicated to that housing assistance line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| There's also a partnership with Civil Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| And I'm going to let Linda talk about this, because I know she met with those judges on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| Yes, we actually have Christina McGruns in our law department to thank for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| She set up that meeting, and we talked to the five judges in Civil Sessions Court, gosh, it was probably six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3669)|
| 1:01:19| to tell them about the program so that they would understand how it worked and that we were going to be getting the word out to people about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3679)|
| 1:01:31| And they were really enthusiastic about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| They definitely saw this as something that would really help, obviously, the tenants, but also the landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| Often, when people go through the court system, at that point, they may be evicted for failure to pay rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| And it doesn't mean the landlord is going to be made whole or get any money, necessarily, other than maybe keeping a deposit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3709)|
| 1:01:59| So the judges were pretty receptive, because they saw this as really a win-win for both tenants and landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3719)|
| 1:02:07| So in the meantime, they asked for flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| So our communications department, working with Christina, we created a flyer, and then the flyer became a poster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| And Christina has also talked from the bench about the program so that landlords can be informed, and also tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3737)|
| 1:02:27| So we're very thankful that they were receptive and let us get that word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3747)|
| 1:02:36| And then finally, the health department is aware of our housing assistance program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| They've already referred five families who tested positive for COVID-19 to the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| so that as they have to stay home and quarantine and get better and their income decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| they're able to access funding to pay their rent or mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| And I believe that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| So we are available for questions if anyone has those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| Thank you again, Director Wade, and to everyone on your team for putting together that presentation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| Very detailed, a lot of really good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Council members, I think I see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| So if anyone has any questions, raise your hand, and I'll –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| Councilperson Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Good job, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| This has been extremely informative, and, yeah, I appreciate all the work that went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| I know it was a lot, and it means a lot to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| So thank you all for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| I had a lot of questions about – not a specific question, but just general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Where can we get more detail on the impediments to fair housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Saw the summary bullets, but would like to see some of those broken down in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| And I imagine those recommendations are woven throughout this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| There are several sections in the plan that are specific to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| Linda, you probably know the numbers of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| But then we will also have an actual document posted on our website as well, which will be the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3853)|
| 1:04:23| The analysis of impediments is not really a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Mr. Morgan, when do you think that will be available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| I assume you are producing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Yes, sir, we are and have, and it's available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| And I can say that we get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| One was about what programs are included in this plan that may not have been named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3891)|
| 1:05:01| I was wondering about the Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Is that something that uses city funds or federal funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| Becky, you're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| We use city funds for the Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| My question is for, you know, in preparation for this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| I didn't hear any discussion of an evaluation of past efforts and how those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3923)|
| 1:05:32| whether they were successful, whether it was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| something that should be replicated in the upcoming plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| Is that evaluation of past plans conducted as a part of this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| I'm trying to find the specific section to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| But we do have a whole section on evaluation of past performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| It is in section ES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| When you're reviewing this document, it's a long document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| And the way that it's set up is it's got an executive summary, which is ES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| It's got a process, PR, needs assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| housing market analysis, a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| And then the annual plan is at the end of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| And that's the one that talks about specific programs that will be happening starting July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| So evaluation of past performance is part of the executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| And it is on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| So it talks about the previous five-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| the one that we're still under right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Priority needs were not real different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| Homelessness, affordable housing, economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| and neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| So they are not radically different because that's what we have to spend the funds on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| But you can see some review there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| And the other thing that you could look at, Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| is we do a CAPER every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| It's short for Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| And there is a chart in that that shows the goals that we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| and then what we actually achieved each year of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| As soon as this consolidated plan is submitted to HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| I begin working on the fifth year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| which is the year we're in right now, of our previous consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| So the first four years are online on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| And then year five will be something that we submit to HUD hopefully in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| And then I went to the website and I wasn't able to find the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| I could find the meeting presentation, a draft of goals and priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| But that might be part of my issue is that I don't have the plan in front of me to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| It is there, but we actually had, you know, without access to computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| and it's been a little bit tricky, but it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| There's just a lot of verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| We weren't able to put in, like, breaks between paragraphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| But if you see a gray box, and I think it appears different on a phone versus your computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| but you'll see a gray box that needs to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| It still has some to-be-determined information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| But we in our office don't have the ability to make changes to our webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| We have to get help to do that, technical assistance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| But if you see the verbiage that's next to that box, it'll have links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| And the links are to the plan, to the community engagement process, and to some attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4129)|
| 1:08:57| Do you see that in the verbiage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| Hey, Linda, is it 268 pages long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Okay, so here's where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| If you are on the housing and neighborhood development webpage in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| which is community development's page, the top box is the gray box with the links,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| and then there's the pink line that says city online services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| then the blue box that's about COVID-19, the picture of the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| The very first big paragraph that has the heading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| city of Knoxville consolidated plan and annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| it's a link within that that says PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| After 2020-2021 action plan, you have to click on PDF within the second line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4177)|
| 1:09:45| and that's on a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Do you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| I see it, and I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| I had to hunt for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| I kept looking in the gray box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Well, I saw that PDF link there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| but I thought that was just for the one-year annual action plan since it was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| way it was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Okay, we will work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| We will work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Once we're able to actually get into our computers and do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| I want to clean it up, make it much more accessible for folks to be able to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| it, so we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Because the 30-day comment period that begins now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| we're commenting on this document, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Right, okay, so we got to get this out to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| My other question was for the economic development piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| In previous plans, there was the facade grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| Was there discussion of creating any sort of capital funding program for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| business development in this five-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| We still have our commercial facade improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| It is funded through city capital dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| there were no capital dollars set aside this year for that program due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| budgetary constraints at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| We still have funds in that capital program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| and we are working through the projects we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| So that is still an ongoing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| It's been funded with city dollars for probably the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| But just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| the capital funding for business development could be used by these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Economic development goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| We have federal funding set aside for economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| and we hope to use those for workforce development training programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| because we use city capital funds for the actual commercial facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| improvement programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Commercial facade is in redevelopment areas and lower-income areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| but it doesn't necessarily specifically serve low-to-moderate-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| And so we prefer to use our federal funds to serve those individuals who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| really need the job training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| Well, it sounds a little bit like an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| If we want low-to-moderate-income folks to be business owners and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| develop businesses that cater to low-to-moderate-income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| I wouldn't say that they're necessarily outside of that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| Right. You're right. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| And what we've tried to focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| the reason why this construction pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| why that's so important is because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| a lot of what we do with affordable housing is dependent on construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| and on the trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| And if we don't have competitive bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| if we don't have enough contractors and people who will do the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| then we can't do our affordable housing programs and employ local people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| So that really, the two goals really kind of feed each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| that in order to have affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| we have to have people who are trained and are focused with the workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| development is this idea of this kind of a career ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| We want to turn construction workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| after they've had some experience on the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| we want to turn them into subcontractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| We want them to specialize in a trade because then their income level can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| up and then they can do the hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| So that was a proposal that was actually brought to us from the housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| equity group of the local NAACP that they wanted to find a way to train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| people in the communities to do these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| And then our interest was to try to get them, not just instruction jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| but to be able to help fulfill, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| kind of up the pipeline to become the subcontractors and the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| contractors that then employ more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| And I became aware through these discussions that people in these trade jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4464)|
| 1:14:33| a lot of them are retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| A lot of those folks are going to be aging out of working in these professions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| in the next, you know, 10, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| And we want, you know, we want people to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| that those are opportunities that are available to them that pay well and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| don't necessarily require a college degree or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| So that's really our focus is to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| to have the jobs that support the affordable housing that's our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Along those same lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| when looking at the rehabilitation of homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| are there measures put into place to make sure those homes then aren't put on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4512)|
| 1:15:21| the market and sold at a higher rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Could you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Yes, I'll be happy to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| So homeowners that participate in our owner-occupied rehab program have a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4530)|
| 1:15:40| with us and the loan is structured to be something that they can pay back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| So it may be a small amount, it may be a little bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| but it's really based on what their income can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| So part of the funding may be structured as a deferred payment loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| meaning that it gets forgiven over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| And part of it is a regular loan that gets paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| But if they sell, turn around and sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| they have to pay us back all the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| So that's built into the contract with them from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| Same thing goes with any rental rehab project that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| Those loans are forgiven over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| but if they either don't keep the property as affordable or decide to flip it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4583)|
| 1:16:32| sell it, whatever, then they have to refund us the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| And when you do that evaluation of past performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| are you looking at that housing stock to see if it has remained affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| or if after the loan has paid off, those houses are being sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| Well, for our housing rehab program, for the rental rehab, we have to monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| So we have to go look at the facility, look at the housing, examine their files,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| make sure that they're renting the property to low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| So we do monitor the project as long as the affordability period is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| That isn't in our consolidated plan, but that's in our CAPER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| that end-of-the-year report that we do. We report that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| And then for the owner-occupied, is it a similar process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| Yeah, we report on the amount of loans that we have out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| and then any loans that have been paid back, that goes into program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| but then gets put back into affordable housing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| But, yes, we do report those in that CAPER report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| I'll look into the report, but from the answer that I'm getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| it doesn't look like we're evaluating the housing stock to see if these investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| that we're making five, ten years down the road means we have more affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| or if we are contributing to the increased value of our housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| which is making it less affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| Well, the families who participate in the program are getting the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| because they're able to stay there. And this is an income-based program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| so they have to be low-income to qualify to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| And they're getting the benefit of an upgraded home, smaller utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| accessibility features, things like that, so they can age in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| So if at the end we're paid back and they sell it, once we're closed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4720)|
| 1:18:48| and we're paid back, then we don't have a monitoring to see what this house sold for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| if that's your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| There's no way for us to check and see, to go back and look and see if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| homeowner actually sold the house for more money than they paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| Yeah, that is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Okay, I had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Looking at the impediments document, I was surprised that we had identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4754)|
| 1:19:26| essentially racial disparities of different demographics that are impacted differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4766)|
| 1:19:36| under that assessment, but when we looked at what those actual impediments were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| I did not see any sort of, you know, systemic disparities, systemic racism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4782)|
| 1:19:51| interpersonal racism, anything around race as a factor in contributing to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| lack of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Is that a part of the analysis of those documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| Linda and Becky, would you like me to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Sure, go ahead, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Okay, so specifically regarding race, there is an evaluation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| The difficulty is when a landlord, for instance, to keep an example simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4814)|
| 1:20:21| determines to not rent to an individual, they don't necessarily say it's because of race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| The individual that may not have received that opportunity to rent that unit can base it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4827)|
| 1:20:33| of that or other sets of issues that they identified at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| and so it's difficult to nail it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| No one owns up to it, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| It may be hinted at when you have a larger demographic, specifically if it's African| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| American that aren't receiving loans for single-family homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Those kind of issues collectively start to show up in the financial institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4851)|
| 1:20:59| Does that help in the attempt to answer your question, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| And we probably could sit down and dig into the data a little bit better at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| The other end of that is when we're looking at policy, in order to evaluate systemic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4867)|
| 1:21:16| we have to look at impact and not just the intent of an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| So if we see an impact, we have to name it in order to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| If we don't name it, then we don't create solutions to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| So that was one thing that I wanted to lift up was we're seeing the impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| but we're not naming it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| We will go back and look at that in our draft document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| Those are all the questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Next is Councilperson Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I just wanted to tie back to one of the questions that Ms. Parker was asking you guys about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| of the owner-occupied rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Anecdotally, I can say that the four that have happened in the last 15 years that I've been in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4921)|
| 1:22:09| they were all long-term residents who were going to be displaced because their roofs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| their houses were being condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Their roofs were not watertight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| They're electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| They all needed to be up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Three of the four are still in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| I believe they're all seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| Well, all four of them were seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| They're a mix of Caucasian and African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| And one is no longer there as of, I believe, about a year ago because he passed away in his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| So that one was sold by the city in default because the individual passed away and there was no one to assume the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4966)|
| 1:22:56| But they're all here, and they're all seniors and or disabled or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4976)|
| 1:23:04| And no one I've known has sold a home and benefited in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| They're still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| They were there before, and they were going to be forced out because they couldn't afford to keep their house with a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=4993)|
| 1:23:24| Thank you for that, Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| I also want to say that the work that we do with Owner-Occupied Housing Rehab, we're not doing luxury-type improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5006)|
| 1:23:36| These are basic life and safety health code-related improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| We do want the house to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| We want the neighbors on the street to say that they're proud of the work being done and that it improves the value on the street as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5024)|
| 1:23:56| But these are not, by any stretch of the imagination, luxury-type improvements that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I just want to go on the record that I would like the same information that Councilman Smith asked for on the Fair Housing, or the Barriers to Fair Housing report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5053)|
| 1:24:27| So I think, I don't know if I can speak for all of Council, but we probably might all like to take a look at that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5067)|
| 1:24:35| And then the only thing I would say in addition to the, about the Affordable Housing Program is, this has been going on for a very long time in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5075)|
| 1:24:45| and it does do exactly what Councilwoman Ryder said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Keeps people in their houses, but part of the, it's also wealth building for people who are low-income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| Because then if they actually at some point sell their home and they own it, we can't, I mean, all they have to do is pay us back and then we help another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5095)|
| 1:25:05| So I understand it can be competing strategies to try to keep a home affordable, but also it's a great thing for someone who gets a house rehabbed and they get to stay in it for a while and eventually sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5105)|
| 1:25:21| And that's, you know, they're building wealth as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| So that's the delicate balance through all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5125)|
| 1:25:35| Okay, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| I would just say that, you know, if that's the goal, we would put it under economic development so that we're clear about where we're, you know, investing our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5138)|
| 1:25:49| And we are clear about how much we're investing in affordable housing. That's my only concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| I don't think they are. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| Well, just if we have a long term goal of increasing our affordable housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| We have to review the strategies that we're employing to see if we're actually doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| If we're wealth building. Let's be clear about that. But if we're, you know, working to increase our affordable housing stock throughout the city. Let's monitor that and make sure that we're actually doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5169)|
| 1:26:22| I don't think they're mutually exclusive, because I think can create your affordable housing stock, but over time property values go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5182)|
| 1:26:32| Regardless, and that's why we are always going to continue to work on affordable housing. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5192)|
| 1:26:41| increasing how much the city puts in its affordable housing investments every year because you're right Councilwoman Parker it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5201)|
| 1:26:51| We can't catch up fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| I can just tell you, let me just say one thing about our honor occupied program, I'll be happy to send you the number of participants we have still paying loans to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5215)|
| 1:27:07| By and large, these are long, long term residents, and the program has helped them be able to live in a secure energy efficient up to code home where they would have had to have moved out just because the structure itself was not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5227)|
| 1:27:32| They often some some homeowners that apply with us, their homes are in such bad shape that we have to tear them down and rebuild a new one, because the cost to rebuild is more economic economical than fixing up what they're living in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5252)|
| 1:27:50| So, it really is a long term strategy for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5270)|
| 1:27:58| Question from Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200625?start=5278)|
