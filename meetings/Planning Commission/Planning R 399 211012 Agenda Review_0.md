| 0:00:31| Welcome to the October agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| We'll begin here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=35)|
| 0:00:39| Any questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| Anything you all want to ask before we get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| At this point, I'll turn it over to Executive Director Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| Good morning, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| I have a few announcements today before we get started with our agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| I want to give you some updates on a few things that staff have been up to over the past month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| The first public meeting of the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study was conducted a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| We had approximately 50 individuals participate in that public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| both in a virtual format as well as an evening meeting format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| The next step is to analyze the results from that meeting and the feedback that was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| That will happen internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| Then prepare some preliminary recommendations for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| There is anticipated to be another round of public input before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| The intent is to provide recommendations to both this body, county commission, and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| We have a website set up for that study as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| If you haven't seen it, we'll be sure to send out another link to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| Both city council and county commission redistricting operations are coming to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| You all probably read the news or heard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| Our staff has been very involved in this from a technical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| City council staff downloaded and processed the 2020 census redistricting data set a few weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| and then calculated distribution of population among the six council districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| They were able to demonstrate that council districts remain reasonably well-balanced in population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| since they were last realigned in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| Staff presented our findings to the city council redistricting workshop in mid-September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| As a result, city council is considering leaving those boundaries intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| They will take this vote next week, Tuesday, October 19th, for those of you who are interested in seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| A considerable amount of work by our staff has been put into supporting the county's redistricting efforts over the past six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=176)|
| 0:03:06| They ran solution alternatives at the request of committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| They served as data and mapping experts at their redistricting meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| They managed the redistricting website and provided additional information to citizen groups and elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| The county redistricting committee has recommended a plan for the full commission to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| A workshop for public input and a vote on first reading are scheduled for next week, which is Thursday, October 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| I really want to commend the efforts of our staff, our GIS staff, Alex Zindel and Nick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| our webmaster and graphic designers, Josh and Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| and, I think most importantly, our research director, Terry Gahula, who many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| and then our research associate, Aubrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| They put in a sizable effort over the last six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| I'm really excited to announce that the Knox County Comprehensive Plan is moving forward this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| It will be on county commission's agenda on Monday, November 18th, for the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| The contract will include a comprehensive transportation and land use plan as well as a parks plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| This will be voted on by county commission on October 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| We anticipate getting started, finalizing the schedule with consultants in early November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| This effort, of course, will include a robust community outreach effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| It will also include extensive data analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| This is an exciting project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| We anticipate the comprehensive land use and transportation plan to take about 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| and then the parks and recreation portion of it will go a little bit quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| but will be teed off around the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| We will provide regular updates to the planning commission throughout the course of this planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| What we're hoping to do is in November, or possibly December, depending on schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| we would like to give you all a walk you through the scope of work and the anticipated schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| and talk to you a little bit more about what that public engagement looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| and what the engagement of this commission, what we hope it to look like over the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| And we'll do this in conjunction with Knox County Engineering, with Jim Snowden and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:24| Does anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| No? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Okay, we'll go ahead and get started with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| We'll start off with rezoning and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Item number 13, Lowness Drive, southwest of Holman Road and northeast of Starmont Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| rezoning and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| I'll turn it over to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| So this case, this property is located in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| It is on the north side of Lowness Drive, approximately a mile east of East Weisgarber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| It connects with Middlebrook Pike up here in this top corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| The sector plan and the one-year plan both have this property designated as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| and you can see a little bit of the property in the north is in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| The applicant is requesting to amend these plans to the medium-density residential, retaining the HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:28| As far as zoning, it's currently zoned RN1 with the HP overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| The applicant is requesting RN3, retaining the HP overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| And then this is general context of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| It's predominantly single-family to the west, but there are some duplex developments here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| some townhouse developments along through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| You can see back looking through the zoning, there's some RN3, RN4, and RN5 in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| And so in looking at the reasons we're recommending approval, the changing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| there's an increased demand for housing near employment centers and transit stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| The transit stop for CAT is across the street, approximately in this location on Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| And then as stated earlier, Weisgarber is approximately a mile to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| It's got lots of employment opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| It's consistent with the intent of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| RN3 allows single-family and two-family homes by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| townhouse developments as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| In terms of adverse impacts, there are properties that are zoned RN3 and RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| There's RN6 also in the area, so the requested zoning would not be out of character with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| Lowness Drive is connecting Middlebrook and Weisgarber, so they're both arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| And, of course, that means that they're close to higher intensity traffic in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| and again, the employment opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| The portion that's in the HP will be required to comply with the maximum land disturbance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| identified in the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| And that's why we're recommending approval of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| We feel like it's in character with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| It's not expected to cause any adverse impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Does anybody have any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Okay, on the sector plan, justification is, did you say it was increased need for housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:20| Is that one of the ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Yeah, so we're looking at that as for the rezoning is a change in conditions generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| and then for the sector plan and one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| we're looking at that as change in public policy is sort of that increased demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| So that's how we're figuring that it meets those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| You could really apply that to anything in Knox County on every single property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| So I've never heard that used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| I'm not saying it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| I just wanted to make sure I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Right, and that's why I think we're trying to be very clear with not just citing the increased housing demand in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| but because it's near an employment center and on a transit route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| we feel like this would be an appropriate place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Yes, and just to clarify, the public policy is not the increased demand for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| That's the new information that's become available for the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| So there hasn't been a stated public policy associated with the increased need for more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| We know there's a need for more housing, but that's not a stated policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| That's not included in the justification that Michelle has prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| We'll move on to item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| It's also a rezoning and plan amendment north of Riverside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| and west of Holston Hills Road on Marble Hill Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| I'll turn to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| This one's also in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Marble Hill Boulevard is a private right-of-way off of Delrose Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| The current one-year plan shows this property designated as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| It, too, is also located in the HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| You can see that the property abuts the county land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Sector plan also has it designated as LDR with the HP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| and the applicant is requesting MDR for both of those properties retaining the HP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| The zoning, it's currently zoned RN1 with the HP overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| and the applicant is requesting RN4 retaining the HP overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| This property was annexed into the city in 1992,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| so the area that's outlined in blue, that was the annexed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| But the only property that was ever developed was this central area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| and that was developed into duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| So all these buildings here are duplexed buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| The rest of it has remained undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| And the surrounding area is largely undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| It's predominantly single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| This is a construction and demolition landfill here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| So it is, even though it's in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| it does have sort of almost a rural feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| because of the amount of undeveloped land in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| And this is an eagle view kind of showing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| And so we're recommending denial for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| because it does not meet the zoning ordinance criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| There's not been a change in the physical conditions of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| or development pattern, major improvements, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| And then citing, of course, there is that increased demand for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| but this one's not near an employment center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| and therefore we feel like because of the rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| and general single-family development in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| that it's not in character with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| We don't feel like it's consistent with the intent of the RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| It's intended to be applied to neighborhoods that are characterized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| by a mix of medium-density residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| including a mix of single-family, two-family, townhouse dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| and low-rise multifamily dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| or areas that have been identified as being suitable for such development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| And neither one of those criteria apply in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| Also, the RN4 zone has a maximum lot size of 40,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| which this property exceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| It's 22.38 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| So the applicant states in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| that they want 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| which seemed to indicate multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| And apartments or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| we wouldn't anticipate that subdivision would be following this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| and therefore it would be creating a lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| that's not consistent with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| In terms of adverse impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| there's no RN4 zoning in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| There is RN5 zoning to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| However, most of the RN5 property remains undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| The only part that is is this apartment complex here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| And even though it's somewhat nearby on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| it's on Holston Hills Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| and if you're traveling by car, it's not in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| A lot of the property also exceeds 25% as far as the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| if you look at the slope analysis and map in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| And then, as stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| this came around when the property was annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| It originally was given that R2 zone, general residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| which was widely used across the city at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| It allowed a broad mix of residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| so you could potentially end up with uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| that are incompatible next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| And so when the new zoning ordinance came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| it added different layers of, I don't really want to say density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| because it doesn't organize it in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| but different lot sizes and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| so that you can have a more fine-grained approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| with how we apply zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| And so, therefore, we don't feel like the R2 previous zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| would be applicable in this area, the general residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| because R and 5 is the compatible zone for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| And then a consistency with other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Obviously, the R and 4 zoning would require a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| but we're recommending denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| so it doesn't meet that criteria as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| And with that, I'll open it up to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| Okay, I don't see any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| I'll go on to item number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Might need to switch the cord out, so this is 10J21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| It also includes a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| and staff is recommending a split zone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| And we'll let Levin walk you through it here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:52| Testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| So this is a Knox County case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| This application involves two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| These properties are both undeveloped sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| and they're located on the north side of Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| a five-lane major arterial road with Ridgedale School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| located to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| The applicant has requested to amend the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| the low-density residential and hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| to general commercial and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| The applicant has also requested to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| from agricultural to CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| The sector plan shows both properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| as LDR low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| with some hillside protection located to the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| The steep hillside provides natural topographic separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| for residential uses located to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| In addition, there's existing GC general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| located to the west and to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| These properties have a mix of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| CA business or CA general business zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| is located along the front of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| and has been in existence since 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| Agricultural zoning is on both properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| as well and extends further towards the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| I'd also like to mention that a portion of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| is also located within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| and is zoned RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| so that's just in the northeast corner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| I provided an aerial map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| for a little bit more context to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| You can see to the west is the Bobcat dealership in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| and to the east you can see where the school is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| and the residential area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| Staffers recommending approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| of the northwest city sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| to GC general commercial and HP hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| for all of parcel 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| and the southern portion of parcel 31.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| As seen in this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| staff are recommending that the GC general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| be located on the flat portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| and LDR be maintained towards the rear of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| where the hillside protection area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| Staff are recommending approval of CA general business zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| for all of parcel 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| and the southern portion of parcel 31.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| We do not normally recommend split zoning on a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| However, this is a bit of an interesting case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| In this instance, we recommend partial rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| as it will allow commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| while preserving the environmentally sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| located to the rear of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| and create natural buffering and separation between uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you, Levin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Now we're going to do another little switch here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| The next item on your agenda that we want to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| is item number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| It is 10J21RZ, I'm sorry, number 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Excuse me, we just did 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| 10N21RZ, it's Lakeside Company Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| And Liz will review this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:19:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Again, this is number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| This is south of Island Home Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| north of Anita Drive and east of Cottrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Let me see if I can get the laser pointer on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| This is Island Home Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| and this is James White Parkway for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| The reason we are reviewing this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| is because it's the first extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| of the form-based zone district for the south waterfront area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| This site is approximately 2.1 acres in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| and it's just across the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| from Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| The applicant is requesting an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| of the south waterfront two zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| into this area that's currently zoned RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| The south waterfront zone district is a form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| So there is a vision and intent for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| It includes a variety of contemporary uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| views of the river and should be highly accessible to parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| And I realize this slide is really busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| and you can't see the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| but it's important to note that the form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| requires additional site design and building design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| than the other city zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| And these images are showing standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| for building site and configuration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| ancillary structure design, outdoor space siting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| as well as regulating external elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| such as building frontage and building setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| This shows the original SW2 adopted zone area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| and this little blue circle is adjacent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| So the applicant is requesting to basically extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| this orange area into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| This area shows the Sutree Landing Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| in close proximity to the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| south waterfront greenway extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| And then again, the blue circle is the site location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| In this map, we see that there are new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| multifamily residential developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| that have occurred here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| And again, this is the proximity of the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| and the park that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| The topography of this area too is generally more level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| than some of the other parts of the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| The South City Sector Plan shows this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| as being designated for medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| So we would be recommending an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| of this mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| to allow consideration of the south waterfront zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| And this is a minor extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| of the south waterfront zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| It provides for flexibility and allowed uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| but in exchange for the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| form-based code review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| This is the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| so this dark purple area only recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| RN1 through RN5 as well as the commercial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| CG2, or sorry, CG and office and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| So this would allow consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| of these mixed-use form-based code districts in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| In this aerial, you can see the proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| to the new River's Edge apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| And for these reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| we're recommending what the applicant has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| So it would be a minor extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| of the adjacent land-use designation zoning pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| for all of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Liz, I hope I'm not the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| who didn't get this on the security sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| I'm sorry, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| All mine shows on my computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| is the signposting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Did anybody else get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| I didn't get the complete report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| That's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Yeah, he got the hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| We can check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Yeah, we'll double check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| and make sure that the sync worked correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Liz, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| because I had some questions about this prior to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| and as I understand your recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| or staff recommendation and what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| is that the applicant is actually asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| to be a part of a form code system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| that would actually require some greater attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| if anything is to be developed there rather than less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| And two things, like access to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| I've been to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| It's got that little metal building on it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Is the access, does this property have street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| or is it all going to be across the railroad tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| So the easiest access is across the railroad tracks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| down to Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| However, this whole area where I have the pointer shown here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| is actually right of way for Anita Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| So if there is a way that they could get access through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| they, I guess, potentially could get access there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| But, of course, it would be reviewed by city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| It's extremely steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Coming off of Anita Drive in Hillwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| their main access would most likely come Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| And when I was over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| is there some plan to use the railroad tracks for a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| it's a low-level line, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| to use it for bike trails and walking on the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| to access some of those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Is that what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| I thought somebody told me that when I was over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Yes, there's a Rails to Trails project in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| And it's also very close to this proposed Greenway extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| that should go in soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| I had one concern, but I think it's been allayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| and that was this property is close to the Flinnican Cemetery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| And for commissioners that aren't familiar with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| it's an incredibly old cemetery that, I mean, predates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| there's some graves, I think, that predates the country's founding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| It's old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| So I was concerned about that zoning potentially getting too close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| But the parcel appears to have good buffer from that cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| and it also, now that I'm clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| it's actually asking to protect that area a bit more rather than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Yeah, there would be additional review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| that would be required for any development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| And Liz, do you want to point out where the cemetery is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| just for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Here on the zoning map, you can see this open space zoned location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| This is where the cemetery is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| This is the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1587)|
| 0:26:36| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I'm just curious, the existing building, is that a conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| would that still be a conforming structure in SW2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| So it's my understanding that the building that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| will remain for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| But I guess any future development would require the additional reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:09| Okay, we're going to move on to item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| This is the Graham Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| It's a rezoning and a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Liz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| So this is the north side of Oak Ridge Highway, west of Weaver Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| And this area is approximately 29 acres in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| and has quite a bit of FEMA-designated floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| 100-year floodplain and 500-year floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| along the northeast side here of Grassy Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| which is a tributary of the Beaver Creek area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| The site has frontage along Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| which is a major arterial and is under the jurisdiction of TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| This shows the existing zoning pattern out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| In 1986, the applicant requested to rezone from agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| And then in 1994, they requested to rezone to OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| which is office medical and related services zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| And it's notable that there is also existing vacant sea-owned sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| within close proximity to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| In the sector plan, we recognize that there could be some extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| of the existing commercial area that's more compactly located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| So we did include general commercial designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| in some of this area that is currently zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| However, the sector plan did not recognize the PC zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| at this location because of the concern related to the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| of strip commercial along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| There was, however, adjacent agricultural-zoned areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| next to the CA-zoned area that I just spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| And now we will fast-forward through the history of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| So one of the things that we are looking at to recommend here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| is an extension of the PC-zoned district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| which is different than what the applicant had requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| The applicant requested general commercial land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| as well as CA general business for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| This shows the evolution of the sector plan from 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| When those zone districts were already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| they were not recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| It shows up as low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| with stream protection around the creek area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| And in 2003, the sector plan shows up as a mixed-use special district area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| So that was recognizing the mix of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| and non-residential zoning in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| However, as we mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| this mix of uses was not recognized in the 2016 sector plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| and part of that was due to the fear of the spread of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| strip commercial zoning along the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| such as that that we see along Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| There were several concerns from the community related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| The Northwest County sector plan also recommended development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| of a future corridor overlay along Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| and this is something that would essentially, ideally down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| require additional standards for development along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| This shows the 2020 aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| You can see how this area along the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| appears to be more rural and suburban in form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| with a mix of residential and some commercial uses nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| And this shows the topography in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| You can see it sloping down to the large floodplain of Grassy Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:12| So why is it an error in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| In 2017, the Grassy Creek commercial area was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| because of improvements along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| This site is also in close proximity to areas that encourage additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| growth of medium-density residential, as noted on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| to support potential growth in commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| We're also recommending mixed-use community center rather than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| general commercial, which allows consideration of planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| as well as some residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| The applicant is requesting CA, but we are requesting an expansion of PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| to allow for site plan review at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| and because the planned commercial district also requires a 50-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| perimeter boundary setback, so that would allow for additional buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| and landscaping to kind of soften the look of the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| PC also requires site plan review and would require, oh, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Okay, now we'll move on to concepts and use on reviews and special uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| So item number 26 is 7SB21C, it's Capital Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| This one was postponed at your last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| and staff will provide an update regarding the issues that were raised at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| last month's meeting and relating to the split phase of the signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| authorization and how that was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Let me get my computer up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| I guess it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| There it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| So Capital Drive concept plan, it's on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| It's near Pellissippi Parkway, which is to the left or to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| and at the intersection with Capital Drive and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| The property is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| It's on CB, and the Kingston Pike and Capital Drive are in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| so the development will access a city right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Obviously Kingston Pike is also a TDOT facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| So the issue last month was the concern about the south side of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| intersection and what kind of improvements were really necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| As you can see in this image, Capital Drive here has three lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| a turn lane to the east, a through lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| and then a turn lane to the left or west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| The concern really was this left turn lane on Capital Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Right now there's actually a small landscape median with a sign in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| that is for private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| The developer for this project was concerned with the removal of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| and wanted to do a split phase stoplight here at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Basically what a split phase is is on the north and south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| they would go at separate times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| So the north side would get the green while the south side stays put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| and then vice versa, the green would be for the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| So they don't go at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| What the city and TDOT was concerned about was obviously traffic flow on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Kingston Pike and how that might interrupt traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| So the applicant had their traffic engineer study the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| intersections to the west and two intersections to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| to see how the split phasing would impact those two intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| and what they found was it wouldn't substantially change traffic in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| The city, TDOT, agreed with the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| and are willing to allow the split phase here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| So at this point, this left turn lane won't be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| They'll just have a combined left and through lane here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| and they will still need to make some improvements to the south side of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| intersection, tighten up some radiuses where there's some very large radiuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| today, but other than that, they won't need to do the left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| that was originally required by the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| We're not making any decision about traffic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| We're just looking at the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| Yeah, so the project itself is on the north side of the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| This developer will be required to make improvements to the whole intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and not just the new road and the four lots that they're requesting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| but there is now resolution to the issue of what kind of improvements are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| anticipated on the south side of Capitol Drive, which was the hangup last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| with some concern, kind of improvements that are going to be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2192)|
| 0:36:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Move on to item number 32, which is 10B21UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| This is an expansion of existing surface mine and mineral extraction operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| at the forks of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| So we get these types of requests on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| Obviously quarries are a pretty important aspect of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| and this particular quarry has been around for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Obviously you see the two water-filled pits here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| These are decommissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| The same operator operates the pit on the east side of Governor John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| which kind of runs between the properties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| This is Forks of the River Industrial Park where this is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| This proposal is really to incorporate the parcels that you see highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| The rest of the properties inside of this area have already had some kind of plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| of operations approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| So we are approving a plan of operations for the entire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| or at least a new plan of operations for the entire facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| but incorporating these new parcels into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Technically this parcel has received approval for in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| but what they want to do now is different than what was approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| So this was only approved for stockpiling, essentially, their material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| but now they want to expand their pit into that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| So let me show you what they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Let me zoom in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| So as you can see, these are the two existing pits that are filled with water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| Basically everything in pink crosshatching, purple crosshatching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| would be what the new pit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| The new pit would be substantially the entire site between Asbury Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| South National Drive, and Power or Water Plant Drive, I think it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| We're here to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| They will have a berm that's along the exterior boundary of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| That's partially to protect not only their pit, but the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| They don't want people just coming and going off of a site like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| The berm is usually created out of overburden from the mining operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| They do intend to see the exterior of the berm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| so it's not just a rock pile from the exterior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| and they do plan on putting in a 15-foot type A planting screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| around the outside boundary of the property as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| to help visually buffer the mine operation from the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| and the Asbury community in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| I just want to kind of hint at this in my staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| that there is a historic Asbury community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| So this property is part of the mining operation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| The old historic Asbury community is basically around this corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| I just wanted to point that out because it is kind of a significant part of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| It is kind of tucked in with all the rest of the industrial park, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| This property is zone industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Mining operations are a permitted use within the industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| but the only reason why it comes to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| is to review the plan of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| So some of our typical use and review criteria don't apply to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2435)|
| 0:40:45| It's really the plan of operations that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| like how are they going to operate the facility, how are they going to handle noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| how are they going to handle vibrations and blasting and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2452)|
| 0:40:59| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| How are they going to handle the blasting and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| Well, I'm not an expert in this one, of course, but they are pretty heavily regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2469)|
| 0:41:20| They can't just use any type of blasting methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| They do have to abide by all the permitting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| Something that's a little bit unique for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| and something they have been working with the veteran cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| that's on the southeast side of the river is to make sure that there's no planned events there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| while they do the blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Obviously, that could be potentially traumatic for some people while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| They can't work around everybody's schedule, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| but that is something that they do try to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| I guess my general question is because it is a very sizable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| especially when you show that in the purple hatching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| like you can really see how large it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| that's a lot of, even with the berm, that protects from visual issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| but from a noise and if you're part of that community there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| I mean, others said they've been doing it for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| but if it's on a larger scale, is it a greater concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| Well, as far as, I can't remember when they stopped mining on this side actively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| It's been, I want to say it was, I can't remember if it was mid-90s or mid-2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:46| It was basically when the pit on the east side was originally approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| that they stopped most of the pit mining operations on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| So it's been a while, obviously, since the blasting has happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| They do still actively use this site for the processing of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| and the pickup of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| But yeah, that's always been a concern with quarries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| and it's just the way that they have to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| without that kind of efficiency of using blasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| it probably would make it impossible to operate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| So this hasn't been an active mine for about 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| and now they're wanting to reactivate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| That's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| unless an applicant can address that if needed on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| but I'm looking at aerials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| it does look pretty obvious that it was about the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| that the pit on the east side of John Sevier was activated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| and that the mining on the west side kind of ceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Is there anyone with, I guess, expertise in mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| that has looked at this plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, I don't know if someone on staff has experience with something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| but this seems highly or very different from anything that I've seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| So looking at this, you could say anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| and I would think, oh, that makes sense, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Outside of reviewing, I've reviewed a couple mines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| but this is pretty boilerplate information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| that they have in their plan of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| Yeah, and as Mike mentioned, it is a highly regulated operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| There are performance standards in the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| You know, that they have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| And the fire marshal is involved as well in terms of reviewing their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| That whole area over there is just riddled with quarries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| and mining all the way around the French Broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| up to the Forks of the River there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Burkhardt Enterprises is very heavily involved in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| So it's a pretty concentrated area of mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Did you have a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| So we'll move on to item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| This is 7C21SU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| This is the revisions to the UT Research Park just off Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| I just wanted to touch on this one again since we did look at it last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| and we had some questions at the gender review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| And one of the questions had to deal with whether, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| since it's a state-owned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| whether we have any jurisdiction over them from a zoning standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| And maybe if needed, the applicant can address this in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| But I think I kind of mentioned this last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| that there was an agreement on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| that they would abide by the zoning standards for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| And that's being continued to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| So, I mean, it is a state-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| There's a few layers of management there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| You've got the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| You've got the, you know, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| And then there's a foundation or a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| But it's an entity that basically oversees the research park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| But we're still treating this as they do have to meet the zoning standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| And as part of that, the design guidelines and master plan for research park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| And this amendment is the amendments that they're proposing update the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| park guidelines to reflect the most current branding of the UT research park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:46:59| and some other miscellaneous changes to basically reflect how the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| park has changed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| Some of those include changing some of the quads to parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2831)|
| 0:47:20| Let me just pull this up real quick, the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:30| So, for instance, this quad here was predominantly, you know, a grassy area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| or an open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Now it is proposed to be parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| And the same thing is over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| But like I mentioned last month, the original intent and desire for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| development was to have more structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| And that just has not been – it's not something they anticipate being feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| So that's going to drive more surface parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| And they need to fit it in where they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| There is still a lot of open space in this research park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| And even though they are going to lose some quad space, I think overall the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| park will still have a very kind of open feel to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| And they still are trying to maintain as much of that original intent as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| Another big component of the revisions is to update the master sign plan or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| sign plan for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| And by consolidating all the sign standards into an appendix called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| the master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2915)|
| 0:48:47| One of the issues that has arised in the past is each building was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| allowed one mall sign, even though it was technically allowed to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| decent amount of sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| Now the type of businesses that are going here, the type of facilities going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| in are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| It's not just a research facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| There's other types of businesses going in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| There is a need for more signage on structures to recognize those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| in the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| So these amendments do take away the one mall sign maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| It does allow more wall signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| And as part of that, you know, Seth was a bit concerned about how much wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| signage could end up being placed on the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Alcoa Highway is a scenic corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| So we talked to the applicant about two different types of small signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| those that face Alcoa Highway and those that face inward or some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| direction, basically don't face Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| The recommendation was to have those signs that face Alcoa Highway be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| more than 250 square feet if they're internally illuminated, no single sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| being, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| So no single sign with internal illumination bigger than 250 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| and no total signage more than 500 no matter if it's internally illuminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| or not and how many signs you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| So if you have two signs, you could have two 250 square foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| If you have three signs, you're going to have to distribute those sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| area even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| And then for all other wall signs, it's 200 square feet no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| whether it's internally illuminated or not and 400 square feet total for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| structure or for those other elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| So basically we're just, because these buildings are so big, they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| could end up with some really large sign areas available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| So this is trying to rein in the sign limit just a little bit to keep with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| the original intent of the research park and still provide some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3065)|
| 0:51:18| Anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3083)|

| 0:51:28| Is there anything else that the commission would like to discuss today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| Seeing none, I guess we'll adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211012-agenda-review?start=3095)|
