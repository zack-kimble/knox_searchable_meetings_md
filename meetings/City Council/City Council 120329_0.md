| 0:05:26| I'm the Director of Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| for the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| and I've provided you with a handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=330)|

| 0:05:34| to the first page of the handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| and it's titled Community Development Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| Community Development Week is a national event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| that encourages cities to highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| community development activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| that are funded with federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=349)|

| 0:06:22| on the plan at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| Wednesday, April 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| we're planning a bus tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| of community development projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| from 8.30 to 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=391)|

| 0:06:36| Please RSVP to me via e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| if you're able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| We're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| at the Three Rivers Market on Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| and we will end there at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| So we'll be going all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| all different districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| looking at projects that we've completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| with community development funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| There are also two activities that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| At 1 o'clock, the Banking and Finance class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| is doing a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| and the Youth Academy of Finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| was originally funded with Empowerment Zone funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| and so the legacy of that is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| So we wanted to highlight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| as well as a presentation for the seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| from Project GRAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Once again, community development funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| Empowerment Zone funds were used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| to help the summer institutes for Project GRAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| Then on Thursday, April 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=457)|

| 0:07:41| from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| This is an opportunity for our subrecipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=465)|

| 0:09:01| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| They're trying to keep me straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| The purpose of the workshop is to overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| of the department goals, programs, and funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| It's to review the proposed annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| It's to give you some highlights of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| that we've completed in the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| We're also going to talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| about the substantial amendment for the current year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| that has to go to HUD at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| as the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| And then we'll have a time for questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| The mission of the Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| is to revitalize low- and moderate-income communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| and strengthen all city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| We accomplish this mission by working with multiple partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| on many programs with various federal, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| and local funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Our desired outcomes are safe, sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| and vibrant neighborhoods, decent, affordable, healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| and energy-efficient housing, accessible and fair housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| economic opportunities for individuals and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| active public participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| through strong neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| and responsive, collaborative partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Our department is organized into several different divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| The Disability Services and ADA Compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| our Fair Housing Assistance Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Housing Rehab and Financing Programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Economic Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Homelessness Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| and Grants Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| I know this is a little small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| but these are our goals as established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| in the five-year consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| And some of you remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| but every five years the city has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| a comprehensive five-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| and take in a lot of input and community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| as well as consultation with service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| and from that develop five years' worth of goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| for the use of community development funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| So these are our goals on which we base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| what we do in the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| Federal funds have to be focused on one of the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| And if you look on the left side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| you can see the federal objectives have to be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| by all of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| So either it's to provide decent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| create a suitable living environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| or create economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Our funds are limited to serving low-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| and moderate-income neighborhoods and individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| taking care of blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| and we do that through all the programs that we implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Our local goals are home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| We aim to increase the supply of affordable home ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| improve the quality and energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| of owner-occupied housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| improve access to fair and affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| owner-occupied housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| increase the supply of visitable owner-occupied housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| Under rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| our goals are to increase the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| of affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| improve the quality and energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| of affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| improve access to fair and affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| and increase the supply of visitable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Under homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| our goals are to increase the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| for persons who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| improve access to permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| for persons who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| and provide supportive services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| for people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Under the next category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| which is to create a suitable living environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| we focus on neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| And our goals are to mitigate the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| of vacant, blighted, and foreclosed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| eliminate environmental hazards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| that impede redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| improve the safety and livability of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| through redevelopment and revitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| strengthen neighborhoods by increasing the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| of resident and stakeholder-led organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| support quality facilities and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| available to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| promote the development of mixed-income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| and improve mobility and access to transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| And finally, under creating economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| we do that through economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| We increase access to economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| for businesses in low, moderate-income areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| increase access to economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| for low- and moderate-income persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| and remediate and redevelop brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| On the far right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| you'll see the priority level for all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Most all of these goals have a high priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| There's a couple that have medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| That doesn't really mean anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| as far as how our funds are directed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| but we do direct most of our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| to the high-priority level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| We would like to be able to fund all of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| but as you'll see in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| because of our decreasing federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| we really focus only on primarily housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| and neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Becky, is there a comparable chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| that shows the dollars related to those categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Yeah, you'll see that in the projects in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| Okay, the annual action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| details how the city will spend federal grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| These are the grant funds that the city receives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| specifically community development block grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| home, home investment partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| and emergency solutions grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Our plan is guided by the consolidated plan priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| that we just talked about and HUD regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| the needs in the target areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| leveraging other resources, other city departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| community partners, and other funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| We try to be proactive rather than reactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| and we try to be progressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| in future thinking in our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| The next slide, this shows the target areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| that were established in the consolidated plan in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| I hope that you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| We have four target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Area 1 is East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| Area 2, I can't even read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Area 2 is the Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, Beaumont area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| Area 3 is Oakwood Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| and a little area across Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| And then area 4 is in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| and it includes Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| These target areas are where we focus most of those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| but it does not preclude us from doing activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| in any other location within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Our funds do need to be spent within the city, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| All right, here's the revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| the proposed revenue for the 12-13 year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| and we've received this information from HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| so we're pretty sure that if our plan gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| these are the dollars that we're going to receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| and those are listed under the column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| that says Proposed Revenue 2012-13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| I left up there the revenue from 10 and 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| just to give you an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| and show you how much our funding is being decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| As you can see, in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| we got over $2 million in CDBG from our HUD allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| This year, they're proposing $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| That's a $470,000 decrease from 2 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| We do not have any funds to add to our budget this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| from former years, because of the decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| we've done a good job of spending past dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| so we don't have any what's called carryover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| or reprogrammed funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| We are estimating program income to go up a little bit to $220,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| and some of that is because of the Pinnacle Bank FAHI arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| that you all approved a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| We'll talk about that a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| So our total CDBG for the year beginning 2012, July 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| is $1,781,970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| As far as home, our allocation is $898,723.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| You can see the difference between 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| and the coming year is $493,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| So, once again, those funds have been decreased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| at the federal level pretty substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| We don't have any carryover once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| We are anticipating more program income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| so our total home budget is $1,328,723.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| Our emergency solution grant funding is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| That's the one source of funds that has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| It's up to $146,665.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| So our total budget for federally funded projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| is $3,282,358 for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| As you can see, that total budget is down about $1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| from two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Okay, if you would switch over to the long sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| this page that I provided, it's got a lot of lines on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| This is what we're proposing to spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| that I just talked about on in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Does everybody have that? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| The first group of projects, 1 through 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| are CDBG and home-funded projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| and they're put together because some of the actual projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| are funded with two sources of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| The first one is the Commercial Facade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I know many of you are aware of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| and what the benefits are to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| It is a loan program for exterior improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| to commercial buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| to promote economic development in redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| and other low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| We are proposing $100,000 for the Facade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| The second project is Property Acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| This is the acquisition of blighted properties to use as housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| We dispose of those through our Homemakers Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| and this is focused on redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Both the Facade and the Property Acquisition projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| we request capital funds for those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| But all you're seeing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| is the federally-funded portion of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Project number three is Owner-Occupied Rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| That's the largest one activity that we do within our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| It's funded with both CDBG and home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| And that is rehabilitation of single-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| for low- and moderate-income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| We do full rehabs to bring the houses up to standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| There are times when we actually tear the house down and rebuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| if it's too costly to rehab the existing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| That's a large portion of the work that we do in community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| is for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| And you can see it's funded with CDBG and home to almost $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1310)|
| 0:22:00| CAC is one of our subrecipients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| and we provide funds to them for emergency home repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| They do emergency repairs not to exceed $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| to take care of structural or system failures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| for low- and moderate-income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We provide funds to Neighborhood Housing to do minor repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| They do most of the work with volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| and our funds are for materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| They do this through their Operation Backyard program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Our funds go to pay for supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| and then they have young people, students, primarily doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| Disability Resource Center, we have a ramps and rails program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Our funds help build ramps for low- and moderate-income folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| who need accessibility in and out of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| We fund the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| They provide technical assistance and design assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| to community organizations and nonprofits, churches, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| for design work at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| We provide down payment assistance for our CHODOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| and those are community housing development organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| that develop affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| And for their homeownership program, we provide down payment assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| so that they can help get low-income families into their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| We also provide development funds for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| And as you can see, this is $380,000 for the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| and that is for the CHODOs to build, actual build affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| And we have several CHODOs in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Neighborhood Housing is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Knox Housing Partnership is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| CAC has just formed one called CAN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| And East Tennessee Housing Development Corporation is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| They're building two houses right now in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| So those are all the CDBG and HOME-funded actual projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| The next three lines are the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| This is the money that our department receives to operate all these things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| This pays for staff and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| And the CDBG admin is capped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| It's capped at 20% of what we receive plus our program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| We're able to fund project delivery costs with CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| So you see that other $505,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| That pays for the staff that actually works on the housing projects in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| And then the HOME administration, that's capped at 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| and that pays just for a couple of folks who run the HOME program in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| So are there any questions on those projects right now, the CDBG and HOME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| before we move to emergency solutions grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| I have one question about the emergency home repairs, number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| If a low-income person applies for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| how long does it take for that process to work before they actually would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| CAC has a very long waiting list, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| I, at this point, can't say for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Calvin, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| He says it's been almost a year sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Yes, we try to refer folks to neighborhood housing as well if they have a real emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| Neighborhood housing seems to be able to get to it more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| I'd like to ask, if I could, I was referring back to the sixth slide you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| which were sort of the five or six categories of activity, housing and rental housings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| You've got all the housing and facade things lumped together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Is there a comparable chart that takes your five priority categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| and puts the dollars in that, or not really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| In other words, you have homeownership, rental housing, homelessness, neighborhood stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| economic development, but this just divides it up between CBDG and home in the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1584)|
| 0:26:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Well, if you look at the facade, the facade funds would go basically under economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| Everything else is homeownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Well, neighborhood stabilization is property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| but, I mean, it's kind of hard to categorize it in these because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| doing homeowner-occupied rehabs is also neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| So is commercial facades is neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| So these goals, it's hard to separate how much funds are spent on these goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1623)|
| 0:27:11| These goals kind of cover everything that we do, and it's very interrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| So all dollars sort of point to the chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| I mean, if we had a project that was to develop a rental housing, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| we can isolate those dollars and say X amount of money was spent on this rental project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| or X amount of money was spent on this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| They do accomplish the goal of neighborhood stabilization as well, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Moving on to emergency solutions grants, we do take applications for those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1670)|
| 0:28:00| And, you know, we advertised, we sent out the applications to all the homeless providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| We received those and graded those, and I did have the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| We received well over the amount of money we have, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| I don't know where that paper is, but we have $146,000 to disperse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| We received probably close to $300,000 in requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| So we have to evaluate each proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| Not one entity that asked for funding got full funding for what they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| So we try to meet the goals of the emergency solutions grant program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| and provide funds to support their services the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| Homeward Bound through CAC is the first project on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| and they provide direct service to the utility company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| or to a landlord to help folks either get into housing or prevent homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| It's a very successful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| It used a lot of the ARRA money, the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| and it serves a large number of people right now to prevent homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| and get them back into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| So we're funding them at $41,000, $466,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| Legal Aid of East Tennessee provides legal assistance to homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| to help them access what they need to get into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| whether it's a driver's license or a birth certificate or the paperwork they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| whatever they need to get them in the position of securing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| Volunteer Ministry Center, we are funding the Day Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| We provide staffing and maintenance and also some case management dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| We're funding them at $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| The YWCA provides transitional shelter residents for women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| and we have funded them for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| We're providing funds for case management and some of their utility and maintenance costs, $9,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1818)|
| 0:30:27| Family Promise is a new applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| You might have seen a write-up in the focus paper about that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| They provide case management and educational and training assistance to prevent homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| We're funding them at $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Catholic Charities, we're funding Samaritan Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| which is transitional housing for senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| We're actually funding maintenance and replacement of some of their bedding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| their mattresses and beds, for hygiene purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| And we're funding them at $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| And then the University of Tennessee manages the HMIS, Homeless Management Information System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| We're able to fund that with emergency solutions grants now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| and they coordinate all the providers to use the Internet communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| so that homeless services can be tracked throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| And then we have a small amount of administration that we're allowed to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| to help us operate our programs through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| Each one of these programs requires that a staff person, we have a contract with these entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| we have to approve all their invoices, we have to monitor them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| So even though the amount of money that's funded for these organizations is fairly small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| it's labor-intensive on our part with our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| because we have to monitor and track how all these funds are spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| and report that to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| So are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| The next steps, the annual action plan was posted on our website March the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| The public hearing for this plan is April the 10th, 6 p.m. at the Cancelor Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| We will receive public comment through April 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| and then we will bring this to Council on April 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| The plan is due to HUD on May the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Next, I'm just going to let you see some of the highlights of the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| some of the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| This is the Owner-Occupied Rehab Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| On the top, you'll see a house at 2458 Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| The before is on the left, and the after is on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| On the bottom, you'll see the interior of a house at 2601 Linden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| the living room before and after, and the kitchen before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| So you can see that we make a great improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Here are some examples of replacement homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| These are where the cost to do rehab on these homes was so expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| that it was more economical for us to replace the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| So this one at 2110 Branner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| You can see the before on the left and the after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| And at 3603 Martin Luther King, the before is on the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| and the after is on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| These are some examples of My Front Yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Now, we don't have any funds for the coming year for the My Front Yard Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| but we will be funding it with program income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| that we're getting back from some of our Empowerment Zone funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| So we will try to continue this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| My Front Yard is a residential façade program up to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| That's basically a grant to the homeowner to do exterior improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| And once again, this not only helps stabilize their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| but it stabilizes the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| See the one at 1021 Catherine on the left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Before and then after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| That's a question right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| What was your budget this year for My Front Yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| We had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| It was just ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Last time we funded it was 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| and we are still working on some of those right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| How much was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| It was $200,000 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| And that was just an outright grant, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| There are certain things that the homeowner has to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Their taxes have to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Their mortgage has to be current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| But it's a deferred payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| So it drops off so much over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| So if they turn around and sell it year two, then we would recoup some of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Go back to the slide before that on the replacement homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| I'm just not real familiar how that exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| Did you all do that through Chideau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| We do that in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| The homeowner has a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| We help the homeowner select a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| The projects bid through a bid process like the city uses for procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| And we help the homeowner pick a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| The contractor builds the house for the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| and we oversee the work and make sure that it meets city standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| And, of course, it's inspected by the city inspections and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| And, of course, the funds for this, most all of this is a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| So the homeowner pays us back over 20 years for this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Like at zero interest or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| It's one or three percent depending on their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Is that the money that you run through Pinnacle, or is that a different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Well, it's the same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| We will be doing that starting July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| It's the loans that they buy, that FAHE buys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| So they still have the piece of cash to work another home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Right now we collect the loans over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| We service them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| For people watching at home, when you talk about your front yard or my front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| you're not talking about your personal front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| No, that's the name of the program is My Front Yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| The house is looking very good, and I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| These are some of the houses that I believe Neighborhood Housing built these in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| These are brand-new houses, all affordable, Energy Star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| And, you know, they use some of our dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| They use some other dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| But then they sell these to low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| And, you know, obviously I've seen these and been bombing through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| and they really fit well in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| They're very cautious to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| I know Councilman Brown at one time had a concern about some of the homes, maybe Habitat, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| but they didn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| They didn't really look like they fit in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| And these really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| They did a great job with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Yeah, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| We participate with our CHOTOs when they have house designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| And, you know, we make sure that if it has to go to an infill review committee, that that happens, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| they meet all the requirements of any other builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| Is this some of the infill housing styles that MPC has put together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| They put together a little architectural book of house styles for infill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| These are separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Okay, moving on to chronic problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| And this is covered under our acquisition and disposition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| These are some that we've acquired and then sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| Council approved both the acquisition and the sale of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| This is on Beaumont Avenue, right across from the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| You can see before what it looked like before boarding and lot clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| And it has sold, and the owner is in the process of rehab right now, so it already looks a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2346)|
| 0:39:15| Here's one on Gill Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| You can see the before on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| The back was burned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| It was really an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| And then after boarding on the right, and we just sold that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| So we anticipate it looking better and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| What kind of what did you buy them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| What did you sell them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| And, you know, what was the plus or the minus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Do you remember the cost of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| What was the real estate commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I wasn't going to ask that, but since you did, it's always something important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| I can verify that there was no real estate commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| I was the one that took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| But on Gill, when we purchase a property through the chronic problem property process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| we have to deposit an initial amount with circuit court, and that is dependent upon an independent appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| And the court process is sometimes quite lengthy, and the value deteriorates over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| However, when we initiate that process, we have to put that amount in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| It's either the higher of what the property assessor has the property valued at or the independent appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| And this particular home we paid $22,000 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| And over time, as we continued to have it listed with no significant interest in purchasing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2431)|
| 0:40:42| the final appraisal came in at $6,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| However, the successful bidder bid $9,500, which was $3,000 over the minimum due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| And any time we have a property that has been taken through the eminent domain process, they must bid a minimum amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2454)|
| 0:41:04| And that would be whatever the current fair market value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| And that appraisal cannot be older than six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| Do they have a certain time to build this out, you know, fix it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| In the Homemakers Program, the first step is it will go before a committee of all the applications that are submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| That committee reviews all those every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| And if a successful candidate is determined from that, they execute a Homemakers Agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2486)|
| 0:41:35| That agreement specifies that they must obtain all of their financing within 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| and they must have any significant changes to the exterior of the home, if they're going to make any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| before an infill committee or the Historic Zoning Commission within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| Or what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Well, their agreement would expire unless they ask for an extension, and typically all those taken care of well before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2516)|
| 0:42:07| I'm seeing more and more now that people are coming to the application process with the financing secured in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| And that takes care of, you know, 90 days right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| Are these folks that will live in the house or fixer-upper folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| When the committee reviews applications, we look at the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Sometimes the area has a market for rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Sometimes it is primarily for homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| There is a scoring system based on the homemaker's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| If it is for homeownership, they get an extra mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| And if it is not for homeownership but it's in keeping with the area that there is significant rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| then it's not to their detriment either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| This particular home will be rehabbed and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| The people who are rehabbing this will not live in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| They live in the area, but they will not live in this particular home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| That's one we approved a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| A few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Cheryl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| Mr. Chairman, there's a stranger in Mark Campin's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| I had a question about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| Now the appraisals, the city pays for all of the appraisals for these properties, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| Here's another one at East Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| You can hardly see it before the lot clearance and boarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| And then here it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| We do have a homemaker's agreement on it, and this will come before council to sell as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| And you did all the stabilizing, the roof tarp and whatnot just to get it marketed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| There are things we have to do on some of these properties to get them in a condition to where anybody can even look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| This one was in basically very unsafe condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| You couldn't even go in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| So there are things we have to do in order to get it prepared so people can go in and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2656)|
| 0:44:28| Here's another one at Plymouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| This is going to council next week to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| You see these are all before pictures, exterior and interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| The roof had literally fallen in with a lot of debris with it in the kitchen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| So we had to clear that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| So right now it looks like this, and somebody has put in an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| We've approved that, and we're ready to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2694)|
| 0:45:02| Here's some examples of façade, recent façade projects that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| The before at 2125 Middlebrook on the left is now a law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2706)|
| 0:45:13| You can see it on the right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| And then the car wash, the ball car wash at 2350 Magnolia, the before is on the left and the after is on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2715)|
| 0:45:28| Here's an example of our business expansion loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| This was originally funded with Empowerment Zone funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| We will continue to fund this program with the loan proceeds that we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| As we get paid back, we will be able to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| This is Three Rivers Market before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| This is the Merida Bread Bakery outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| I'm sure you all remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| And then this is what it looks like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| It's a really nice business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| An asset to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| So not only is it, you know, helping the neighborhood in its appearance, they've doubled the number of jobs at that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2761)|
| 0:46:09| They're providing a service for all the residents that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| It's really a positive benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| There's real parking at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| You don't have to take your life in your hands turning into those three spots on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Here's some examples of Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds and what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| Neighborhood Stabilization Programs were part of the stimulus money that the city got a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| So those were focused on blighted and foreclosed and abandoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| So we used them on several large buildings to create new housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| They were all focused on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| So this is Flanagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| This is before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| You can see the top, the gym there, and what it looked like on the right on the exterior and after is below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| It created 48 units of permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| They've leased about ten at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Are they all still veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| They've got maybe one that isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| The old school on the top, that was an abandoned, blighted old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| We used Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds to rehab that into 25 units of elderly housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| And then the Dutch Valley project that I talked about a minute ago for our kickoff event is on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| On the left is what it looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| It was a foreclosed and vacant fourplex on Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| It really needed a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| It was pretty not in good shape at all, and it was completely vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| Knox Housing Partnership purchased that property, tore down the old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| and rebuilt six units, all three bedrooms, that are LEED Gold certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| And they're all visitable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| What do you mean by visitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| They have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| IndyCamp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| They're visitable to persons with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| There's no more than a single-step entrance, and there's an accessible bathroom on the main level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2899)|
| 0:48:29| On the Red Valley Way property, is there no inviting facade that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| Come into me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| I mean, it looks like just an industrial building of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Well, it's turned sideways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| It doesn't face Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| It faces inward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| The doorways are in that little courtyard area in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| I can see the little awnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| That may not be a very flattering picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| It's not flattering from this angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I was on the Knox Housing Partnership's board at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| And you see what it looked like on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| It was in pretty rough shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| It was we determined that it was not renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| And those ended up being very energy-efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| You know, they leaked gold, so that's where the money went into being energy-efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| I'm just comparing them to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| We saw those infill houses that we saw before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Not a very flattering picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| They were active neighborhood houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Those aren't a very flattering picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| There's a lot of apartments out there on Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| Not a lot of single family at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Let's recognize Councilwoman Palmer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| Thank you, Mr. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| You mentioned that the Red Valley Way places are visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| Are we moving more in the direction of requiring some kind of a design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| We have a population that will probably need more visitable access to places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| Is this something that MPC and others are moving toward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| Our department is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| We certainly are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| When we fund houses, whether it's done by a CHOTO or whether we build the house ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| if it's at all feasible to do, we require that it be visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3015)|
| 0:50:23| Just some highlights of the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| We've talked about the Pinnacle Bank $2 million that's coming to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| We were able to partner with them and the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| for $2 million in private funds, and that is specifically for our owner-occupied rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| That starts July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| And the way that works is we will continue to do the construction, the rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| At that point, FAHE will come in, purchase the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| They will service the loan with the resident, the homeowner, for the 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| and we will get our program income back all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| It's a refinancing of the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I'm being corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Menville Manor was a pro-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Sell your 20-year loan and get the cash back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Sell your 20-year loan and get the cash back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| Yeah, it's a refinancing, basically, of the loan that we have with the owner-occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| We receive payment, the refinancing, and we're paid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| and then FAHE services the loan for the 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Menville Manor, a project that was also done with the Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| was awarded the 2011 National Trust HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| This is one award in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| and that was given to Menville last year at the National Trust's annual conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| We implemented or monitored over 80 projects and hundreds of individual activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| home rehabs, rebuilds, acquisition of properties, disposition of properties, loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| and all this, the result of all this, is services to many, many families in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3137)|
| 0:52:27| We worked with the Vacant and Blighted Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| I know you're familiar with the new ordinances that are being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| A lot of that has come up from work that came from the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| We're working on tax foreclosure reform at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Once again, that sort of came out of an Organizea committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| that was founded in the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| Our Office of Neighborhoods is developing a capacity-building training program for neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| and we have ongoing achievements in visitable, healthy, sustainable, and energy-efficient development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| And we also had a successful HUD monitoring visit last year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| Just for a moment, I need to talk about the substantial amendment to the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| The city of Knoxville was awarded additional emergency solutions grants in the amount of $46,321.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3204)|
| 0:53:33| That's for the current year that we're in right now, not the year we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| This is for the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| We were awarded that money, and it fell under new regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| not the ones that we funded the other projects with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| So HUD is requiring that we do a substantial amendment to our current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| and tell them how we're going to be using those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| This substantial amendment was posted on the website at the city the same day as the annual action plan on 3-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3238)|
| 0:54:07| We will have a public hearing on it, and it will be submitted to HUD at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| The new funds are governed under the HEARTH Act, the new HEARTH Act that governs emergency solutions grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| and it focuses more on homeless prevention and rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| So all of our funds are going to fund homeless prevention activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3265)|
| 0:54:35| Well, that's the end of my presentation, unless you all have any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| Any comments that you might have or questions will be included in the annual plan that's submitted to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Yes, Mr. Ayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| You have seen a significant decrease over the last few years in your revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Do you expect that over the next two to four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| And if so, what would you recommend or what do you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| How do we get over that hurdle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Well, you know, there's organizations that try to educate legislators about the good things that community development funds do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3306)|
| 0:55:19| One of the purposes of our tour during Community Development Week is to bring in Senator Alexander| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| and Senator Corker's staff as well as Congressman Duncan's staff to see exactly how these funds are spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| and who these funds help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| This is one way that we have of educating our legislators to possibly think twice before cutting these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3338)|
| 0:55:48| These serve low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and individuals, and, you know, it hurts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3348)|
| 0:55:56| There are programs that we can't fund because we've been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| As far as what's going to happen next year, it's very hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| We're fighting to keep funding at least at a stable level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| You know, we'll have to continue to cut programs if we get cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3371)|
| 0:56:19| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| Becky, I'd like to thank you and your staff for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| I know it's an annual requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| At the same time, I think it's very healthy for all of us to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| and just sit back and look at the accomplishments and how much you do with so little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| To me, it's amazing when we see examples of neighborhoods, businesses that have been stabilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| communities that are coming with new life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| I think that it's a tribute to what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| As I said, with not a whole lot, but we're pleased to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| I think I can speak for the other members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| I would like to recognize my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| They are a very dedicated group of professionals that work very hard to implement all the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| that we do with community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| We work as a team, and we work with other departments in the city very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| and we are about doing the good work that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| How were we able to get away from that big, heavy notebook that was a cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Oh, you'll get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Oh, we haven't escaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| You'll have that for when you have to approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Is the contents of that on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| Yes, that's what's on the website right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| That was fun thumbing through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| I'm seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| I mean, it's public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| I don't see anyone other than staff and the press that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| but we'll go ahead and make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| I'm seeing no one come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Seeing no further business to come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120329?start=3478)|
