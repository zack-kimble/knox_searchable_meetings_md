| 0:33:06| Thank you Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Very briefly the self-serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| ordinance was crafted to allow a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| business to come into the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Under the traditional business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| method you have a bartender or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| waiter or waitress that serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| your beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| This business that opened in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| old city you wore a wristband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| with a chip in it where you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| pour your own drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| And because it was a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| business model and it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| allowed under the ordinance then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| we wrote an ordinance that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| And there were certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| regulations that applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| depending on the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| customers they had on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| premises to how many people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| had to be servers to monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| everything to make sure the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| was not being drunk by those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| should not be drinking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Well motels have started to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| to put in the self-service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| equipment and the numbers in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| ordinance would essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2055)|
| 0:34:15| It was you would have to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| server for every 25 members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| the public on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Well if you have a hotel or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| motel you sure hope that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| have more than 25 members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| public on the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Well they could probably be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| the hotel different floors but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| not actually in the area where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| the beer was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| So we modified it to the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| applies to the defined lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| area where the persons or people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| are drinking the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| So this just simply allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| responsible monitored consumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| within the defined lobbies of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| hotels and motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| So there will be a defined space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| in the lobby where the self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| service is going on and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| there will be a responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| party who is making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| people aren't over serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| themselves because there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| electronic turn off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| No in the risk there is a cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| You are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| I think it's a total of 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| ounces if I recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| And they have to end the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| dispensing equipment has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| in the regular sight line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| someone who has been trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Yeah I just want to make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| weren't opening ourselves up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| having a lot of unsupervised you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| know folks who are over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| indulging and then potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| getting in the vehicle and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| So right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| And you also have to serve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| beer in a cup that is unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| that only beer is supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| And with the one that I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| it's a different subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| because we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2165)|
| 0:36:05| hotels versus you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| establishment which is more of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| like a restaurant bar area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| But have we had any issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| over serving at the one facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| that has this in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| I wasn't aware of any either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| I just want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| that those protections seem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2185)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Yeah I will just out myself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| say first off I cannot remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| anything in our reports from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| from KPD that there have been any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| at poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Is that our only establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Mr. Frost that you're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| that has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| I think there might be two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Oh I have a similar model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Similar model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2214)|
| 0:36:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| And I will just say it does cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| You go up and it didn't give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| any more when you when you hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| it and then you have to go turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| So I would say you know I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| we could we could talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| what the pros and the cons are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| of a motel or hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| But what I would say is it runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| the chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2235)|
| 0:37:15| I'm assuming this is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| part of a competitive thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| them competing with like Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2240)|
| 0:37:20| But I'd say the majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| folks would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| They would be guests and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| won't be driving and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| So on that note that model is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| is a better thing because I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| say some of our rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| regulations about beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| particularly some discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I've had with different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| want to do festivals or little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| events when we encourage those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| all to be like downtown and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| special places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| What we're saying is you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| go to these locations to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| these street fairs and you drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2271)|

| 0:42:06| You know worst case scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| before the stadium comes up I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| would like the bottom half the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2529)|

| 0:42:14| literally half the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I would love to get it cleaned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| up and maybe turn it if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| no development opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| maybe turn it into a paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Let it be run by SP plus that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| would help the city in parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| It wouldn't be the closest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| parking to the new stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2549)|

| 0:42:33| from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| That's the worst case scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| otherwise you know maybe a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| complex with rooftop seating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2560)|

| 0:42:50| those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2570)|

| 0:42:52| will be parking lot hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=2572)|

| 1:03:22| to do it because it was far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| safer to limp the trailer three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| blocks up to the transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3805)|

| 1:03:33| further talks with Lindsay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Crockett and Amy over the missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| middle of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| It's come to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| something that I don't read into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| the code and never actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| contemplated and certainly is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| anywhere in the off the coast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| books or reports but we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| apparently not allowed to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| missing middle structure on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| same lot that has a single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| So if you're familiar I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| we're getting in the weeds here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| but if you have a residential lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| zoned are in three are in four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| which is eligible for missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| middle base zoning allows you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| have multiple structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| So in one particular case I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| a lot with historic home on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| that I would like to remain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| single family home and I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| to simply add a missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| housing type on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| And I'm being told that I cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| and the unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| of something like that could lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| to these single family existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| homes being demolished simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| because the economics are well if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| I can put two duplexes on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| lot or I would rather get rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| that single family home or I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| could suffice to just leave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| single family home if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| just add a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| So I would urge us to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| We all said that the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| is an evolving and living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| breathing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| I think that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| needs to be looked at sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| rather than later because it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| end up dooming this hundred and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| twenty year old house on my lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| to demolition when I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| economically save it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| And I don't think that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| bad thing to do if it is and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| don't think we intended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| The other thing that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| struggling with going back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| forth we wrote into the missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3911)|

| 1:05:17| called a front setback but then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| we included language that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240611?start=3919)|
