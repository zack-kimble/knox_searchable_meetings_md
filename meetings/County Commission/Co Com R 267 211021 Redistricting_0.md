| 0:01:47| Before we get into the agenda, just so everyone is clear on the procedure, the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| tonight's special session of the commission is to consider a redistricting plan for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| County as contained in ordinances number 0-21-10-101-SS and 0-21-10-102-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=118)|
| 0:02:10| This plan is also known as proposal 3B as recommended for approval by the redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| I remind my fellow commissioners that because the ordinances before us come from a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| they are recommendations and they may therefore be approved, denied, or modified by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| through substitute motion, so long as any modifications pass on to readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| As is a longstanding tradition of this body with significant pieces of legislation, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| will be a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| There is a public hearing scheduled for next Thursday, October 28th, at 5 p.m. in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=163)|

| 0:02:51| Tonight's meeting is for the commission to debate and discuss, if necessary, and to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| these ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| With that being said, Madam Clerk, would you please read the first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| This is Ordinance 0-21-10-101-SS, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=184)|

| 0:03:19| the county commission districts for the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=199)|

| 0:03:55| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| The Chair will look for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| Motion to approve is made by Commissioner Ward, with a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| The floor is now open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| Any Commissioners wish to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=255)|
| 0:04:24| If not, we will move to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| Commissioner Durrett, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| I'm creaking over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| I have received a lot of phone calls since this has been proposed, and especially this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| week, regarding the timing and people wanting to speak about it, especially with District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| And so with that, and I'm sure a lot of people have gotten a lot of these emails asking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| postpone, or at least for, they said, they were saying to November, but I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| to make a substitute motion that we postpone for at least a week, so there is more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| for my constituents who, in District 2, are being either taken out of this district, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=315)|
| 0:05:25| being added, that they have time to look at this and really give their input on it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| kind of promote the democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Commissioner, we have a motion, a substitute motion, to postpone this first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Seconded by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| That would be to postpone to the October 28th special session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Would that be proper, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| I've already given notice for the second special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| This is kind of unusual, but this body can do what it deems best interest of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| but I've never, the answer is I've never seen that before when you've got special sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| already noticed to the public and public hearing, which is noticed for next week, so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| know that there is an answer, and as always, a policy decision by this body, it's up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| This is the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| That means we can, whatever we do, you have another chance to address any issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| are coming up, and again, we didn't get the census until late, and we're under sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=397)|
| 0:06:45| a pressure to get it done, but I hope we're going to get some more input from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| if they're here to give it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| I would offer a similar comment as Commissioner Smith has reminded us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| There, it is a first reading, and regardless of what we do on first reading, even if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| pass the ordinance on first reading, we're under no obligation to pass it on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| just because we have a special session next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| If there's no further discussion, we will proceed to vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Yeah, I wanted to just discuss something on the map that affects my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| Did you want to do that during this part of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| I guess we should since we're voting to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Yeah, that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| I was just going to ask that if we could make just a couple of minor alterations that affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| the 5th district, and because obviously we can't discuss this amongst ourselves, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| would affect basically a decision from my colleague, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| And under the new 3B plan, number 69W moved transfers over to Commissioner Ward's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=480)|
| 0:08:12| In that, what happens is two of the elementary schools, A.L. Watts and Bluegrass Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| then would shift to his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| So what I wanted to propose would the consideration be that the North Shore Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| because it doesn't affect any population and it's in the 4th district now, just that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| must be carved out and included in the 5th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| So we're losing two elementary schools but gaining one if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| And then the other consideration, when the map was made ten years ago, one of the northern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| borders of the 5th district was Fox Road and Kingston Pike, and they carved out a dentist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| office that is on the southwest corner of Kingston Pike, and it has no population base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=539)|
| 0:09:09| but they moved that to the 3rd district because that is actually in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| But just for uniformity, it seems like if you've got all of the properties in the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| district on Fox Road, why not include that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| So it's just a minor mapping error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Just for clarity, when you're talking about North Shore Elementary, you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| just moving the school, not the precinct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| School only, no population, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Just the school only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| What was the other intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Fox Road and Kingston Pike, which is currently in the 3rd commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| And it's an office building and there is no population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| And that just clears up the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| I was under the impression that we had to move all of the voting district as one big block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| There was no opportunity to change the size or scope of a voting district because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| timing with the election commission, the current city election, and the upcoming 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| So I don't think we have the ability to carve anything out unless you're going to move a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| whole section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| But was I remembering that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| I think you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| I don't know how that would apply if there's no population being moved and only a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I guess that would be a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Commissioner Smith and then Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| I guess that would be a question for the election commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| Mr. Davis, can a non-residential piece of property be moved precinct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=636)|

| 0:13:24| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| You can or can't carve out a piece of commercial property if there's no election, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| nobody registered to vote at that specific property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| Mr. Davis, did you catch that part of the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Could you repeat it, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| I'm probably going to ask Mr. Gajula to help us with this answer, but go ahead and please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| repeat the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you want to repeat that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Yeah, in other words, at the intersection of Kingston Pike and Fox Road in West Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| County, just about a quarter of a mile east of I-140, there's a commercial, probably one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=832)|
| 0:14:01| acre lot or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Is that the dentist's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| It used to be my dentist actually, so yeah, I'm well familiar with what you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| That was originally carved out to the 3rd District, but there's no votes or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I mean, and so, because it was in the city of Knoxville, that's why it was carved out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| But it just seems like if you say, hey, your district is west of Fox Road and south of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| the interstate, so it's those three parcels right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Yeah, my understanding, and please, you may want to weigh in on this, my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| is that the Election Commission can go back and make that change after the fact, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| can move it from the 5th to the 3rd, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| That happened, although I wasn't here, I will tell you anecdotally, I looked at what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| in 2012, 2011, late 2011, early 2012, and there were a number of instances where something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| similar to that occurred, where we moved a street over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| I will tell you, I know there was one in Precinct 31 that literally has got like two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| I plan on addressing that with Knox Planning and later on, later this year, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| another one, I believe it's in Lynn Lonsdale, 19E, 19W, where literally one apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| has been cut out, and I'm not really sure why that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| I certainly had no institutional knowledge of that, but that's one of those where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| going to even that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| So there will be an opportunity in the future, maybe not anything, particularly with no voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| that that can be done after the fact, if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Do you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Did I state that to your satisfaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Terry Gilhool in Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| No, I agree with everything Mr. Davis said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| That particular property, though, if you were to move it, the problem is that you're changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=941)|
| 0:15:50| the boundaries of a precinct, not just the boundaries of the district, and you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| split a district, you can't split a precinct into two different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| So the change to the precinct boundary would have to be coincidental with the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| of the redistricting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| So unless Mr. Davis is able to get that done at the same time, then no, you can't, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| wouldn't be allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| I don't think it matters whether it's commercial or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| You're messing with the boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Regarding the North Shore Elementary School, that's not going to work at all regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| because it will create an island in District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| The property is not contiguous with any of the district boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| So not only would you have a precinct in two different districts, you'd have a non-contiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| That solution wouldn't work at all regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Thank you, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Chris, I have an election law question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| If I own a commercial business, can I use that as my registration for voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1019)|
| 0:17:10| If you live at said commercial address, and the one example I can think of is if maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| you've got a business that's on the ground floor and you live on the second floor, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| certainly you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| I will tell you registration under the law has a lot of caveats to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| So I could blanket answer your question and say it depends on the circumstances, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| certainly is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| But I'll give you one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| A very prominent business owner in town tried to register a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| He has a very prominent North Knoxville restaurant that all of you would probably know and like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I believe it's in your district, Dick, and he attempted to register from that address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| and he doesn't live there, so we could not register him at that address, if that makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| It kind of, but I know people that have lots in the city can vote in city elections if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| they don't live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| That's called property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| These properties are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Property qualified voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| So the people who own the property, number one, would have to have owned it for at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Number two, their name would have to be on the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| It can't be in an LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Number three, the property, I think, has to be at least 4,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| And no more than two people can vote on any piece of property, no matter how many individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| owners own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Does that all sound good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1106)|

| 0:18:52| There is a boundary line, and zoom in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1132)|
| 0:19:02| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1142)|

| 0:19:11| We're underneath where it says Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Our boundary goes right through the middle of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Can that be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Can't fix anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| The election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| After the fact, I believe that can be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1165)|
| 0:19:34| In fact, I know that was done in 2011, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| There were a number of pieces of property where little boundaries, little things here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| and there were adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| But it can't be done as part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Sorry to keep putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Well, again, you can make that correction, but then you have to change, officially change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| your precinct boundaries at the same time that we submit the district boundaries to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| In 2011, when we went through this process, immediately after the submission of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| boundaries, then Commissioner Cliff Rogers met with our staff, and we worked with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| closely on making these very same types of adjustments to precinct boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| We've identified just in our work with city council and redistricting, we've found little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| issues very much like this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| There are also, Mr. Davis is well aware of this, we have precincts that exceed the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| limit on population size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| There's a 6,000 person limit to a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Several of the precincts in Commissioner Schoonmaker's district, they need to be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| So this will be a post-redistricting effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Under everything that I've read in the redistricting process, there is a deadline for us to redistrict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| by December 31st based upon this census data, but there is nothing that prohibits this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| from redistricting again at any given period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| We're mandated to do it once every 10 years, but we can make additional changes down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| road, like you said, with both our districts, just as we can do with a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| to change the number of commissioners and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| But obviously it would be a much more duplicate and bigger process, but it doesn't preclude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| we're not locked in for 10 years, I guess is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211021-redistricting?start=1293)|
