| 0:00:29| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| Welcome to the May agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| One quick announcement before I turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=35)|
| 0:00:41| In the past, when there's a commissioner who needs to recuse themselves for an item, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| on the agenda, we used to have them leave the room, and then we kind of got into, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| they can legally stay in the room, there's no reason why they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| So now we're going to reverse that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| If you have to be leaving them, if you are going to recuse yourself on an item, we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| that you do leave the room, and that includes not only during the board meeting, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| under agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| So you got an item on the agenda, you got a conflict, you'll need to leave the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=74)|
| 0:01:21| and go out the door, and we'll get you when you're finished with that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| That'll be our policy going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| So I appreciate everyone's cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| Anyway, that's all I've got, and we'll turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:39| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| I have a few updates for you all on staff activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| We have added to the American Community Survey Data Explorer that's on our website, so for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| all of you who are interested in data, the 2020 data sets have been added from the census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:59| to that Explorer, so please take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Advanced NOCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| So today is the last day to submit online comments for the first round of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| for advanced NOCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| We had extended that to allow additional time for people to give us their thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| So if you haven't done so, please do, and I appreciate all of you who have shared it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| out with your colleagues and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| The development services with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| We are working with a consultant and City of Knoxville staff, and that has gotten kicked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| off here recently, and the purpose of that, as I've mentioned before, is to evaluate process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| and procedure that involve development applications, reviews, approvals, and the permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| specifically in the City of Knoxville, which planning plays a large part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| And so the goal is to reduce redundancies, create efficiencies, evaluate roles and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=169)|
| 0:02:57| of the City of Knoxville staff, as well as partner agencies such as us, with the ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| goal to improve and streamline how we do our business and make more efficient a complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| development process that a lot of you have experience with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| Planning staff and partners kicked off work with our consultant, Optikos, on the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| that you all recently approved, Missing Middle Housing, for the City of Knoxville yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| I'm really excited about this project, it's a fast timeline, we're anticipating that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| will have recommendations to us by late summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| And just to remind you all, the project is going to be analyzing barriers to what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| call Missing Middle Housing in the City of Knoxville and provide a strategy to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| those barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| So we are anticipating very specific recommendations on how to increase housing and housing supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| in the city in a way that really does respect communities and existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| And those specific strategies might be policy, but are more likely to be amendments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| we can make to the City Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| And that concludes my updates from staff this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| Anybody has any questions about those before we get into the agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| All right, so we'll start off with Road Closures, which is 5A22SC, and this was Levin's case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:26| and staff is recommending denial of the street closure, I'll let him review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:39| Hi there, so this is for case 5A22SC, it's a street closure specifically at Superior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| Street south of Lay Avenue between parcels 082KK018 and 082LB001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=287)|
| 0:05:02| And this is a typical 50 foot right of way width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| I provided an aerial map for your eye review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| And just, this is a zoning map, I know this isn't, like a right of way doesn't have zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| but just for your context, it's R&T zoning which surrounds this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| This is an equal view perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| They're not closing the entire segment of Superior Street, it's just what's outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| I just thought this would provide a little bit more detail for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| So as Amy mentioned, staff are recommending to deny the closure of Superior Street since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| it would prevent the opportunity to enhance connectivity in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| Superior Street runs from Wilson Avenue to Hillside Avenue, a span of four blocks, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| it's not fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| Some of Superior Street is paved with other portions to be developed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| Currently there are no plans in place to pave the undeveloped portions, however, if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| street closure, or sorry, if this street were to be closed, it would stop all possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| of Superior Street from being completed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| Leaving Superior Street open would allow the possibility for it to serve the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| adding to the grid structure of the neighborhood and additional connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| I'd also like to mention that the applicant's desire to close Superior Street is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| purpose of placing a home on their property, however, I do want to also mention that currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| their lot is buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| It does meet the dimensional standards of the R&T zone, and from a staff perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| there really isn't any hardship in place regarding the lot area or lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| And that is what I have for you guys today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Levin, could you go back, put on the aerial again of the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| This one or the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Either one, that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| I guess my question is, did city engineering look at this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| Yes, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| They didn't have any concerns as far as wanting to keep it open or that it should be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| It was more from a planning staff perspective that if this segment were to be closed of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Superior Street, it would really halt the possibility of this to really flow vertically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| through the neighborhood here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| I guess my concern is, who would ultimately build it if it was ever going to be actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| I mean, there's really no economic value for somebody to build a street to meet city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| standards and there's no gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| You're not picking up lots, you're not, that's kind of my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| I understand the grid pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| I'm not sure I understand long-term who would end up building it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| Another consideration to think about is that this could also be another lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| This could actually be built upon if it was, if the right-of-way was closed at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| in time, the city could turn this into a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| It's a buildable lot now, it meets the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| That is another consideration, especially given our current housing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| So he doesn't own this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| No, it's city-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Yes, it's city right-of-way, so if it is closed, then it is divided in half and that land is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| given to each property owner, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Property owner owns both lots, same person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Levin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| My understanding, the applicant would be on the west side and they do not own both properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:25| So, if this was not closed, excuse me, if this was closed, the property owner on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:33| west and the east would benefit from having some additional space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| And just to clarify, if this were to stay open, they could still build on their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=584)|
| 0:09:53| This isn't, I just wanted to summarize that last statement I made in my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| It's not exactly a hardship, what they're going through, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Sorry, I'm dealing with creaky mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| But I hear you saying that they could still build on that, but it would, from an owner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| perspective, be diminished in terms of the pleasantness of it, because there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| a road going right through it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| I mean, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| In reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| So, if it's not going to be built, then it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| I think we're trying to look, you know, 20, 30 years out, but we don't know exactly what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| There are a lot of streets that weren't completed, probably for a number of different reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| and that is there really a reason to close this, this particular portion, and give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| property, split the property and give it to either property on either side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| Is there a rationale to do that at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| And I think planning is saying that no, we don't know long term what might happen, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| we want to, there is some value in maintaining the potential for connectivity, or to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| about, could this be turned into a lot in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| Do you have one additional thing I think might be worth considering that I didn't include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Is that if this were to be closed, this is the first segment of Superior Street that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| would be closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| In the past, there's no other closure along this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| This would be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| So, right now, it remains open, just not fully developed, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| I just wanted to clarify, because I know that when you close a road, it gets split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| up, but you were saying that it's, if it stays as is, it's 50 feet of land, and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:48| the city could, if they chose, actually make that one lot, but if it were closed, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| go to those two property owners, and then they would just have bigger yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| There wouldn't be a third possible house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| I mean, if we close it, would the advantage be that you could actually come back and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| for re-plotting and make it three lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| David, the property owner would have to purchase the portion that went to the adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Is it big enough to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| To have three lots across?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| So, the width of that right-of-way is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| And we will move on to rezonings and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| I'll give Liz a second to switch over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:13:00| So, item number eight is 5D22RZ, and it also includes a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| This is a small parcel located on East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| And Liz will review the staff recommendation on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:44| My apologies for my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| The subject property is at the corner of Greenwell Drive and East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| It's approximately 1.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| This area is mostly a mix of single-family residential homes within PR zone subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| and large lot agricultural zone properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| It began transitioning to single-family residential in this area in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| The sector plan shows this area as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| and it is within the planned growth area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| There have been no major changes in the area since the 2012 sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| It's notable that although this is at an intersection of East Emory Road and Greenwell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| this property does not have frontage along Greenwell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| because of a stormwater facility that's located at that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| The applicant is requesting to go to rural commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| And to do that, they also need a plan amendment to rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| Staff is recommending to deny both of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| because it is largely low-density residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| It's not a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| It's more suburban in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| This oblique sort of shows you what the houses look like in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| And this is the existing property at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| So we're recommending denial. Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=925)|
| 0:15:38| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| I'm going to recuse on the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:55| Thank you. Liz, let's move on to item number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| 5E22RC with the sector plan for Homestead Holdings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| So this is an approximately 58-acre site along the south side of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| It's within the parental responsibility zone of Hardin Valley Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| It's currently zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| And this side of Hardin Valley Road is really characterized by steep topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| and it has generally lower residential densities than the northern side of Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| that does not have quite the slope constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| The applicant is requesting to go to a planned residential up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| They're also asking for a sector plan amendment from rural residential to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| and both of those are within that hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| The sector plan, again, shows this as rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| because it is in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| This is that area along Hardin Valley Road where the growth policy plan on the south side is all rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1019)|
| 0:17:10| and then all the property adjacent to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| and on the north side of Hardin Valley Road is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| It's also notable that in this area there are instances of medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| that were acknowledged in the sector plan that allow for additional opportunities for residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| that have not been built out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| And this is an oblique of the area with the contour lines on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| You can see the steep slopes on the southern portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| and you can see that they are mostly forested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| This is the USGS quad map for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| The blue-lined stream, which you see on the frontage along Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| is a tributary of Connor Creek, and this is a pretty saturated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| It falls outside of the hillside and ridgetop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| but this area may also have some development constraints located there because of this saturated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:27| This is what the aerial oblique looked like in 2006 for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| so you can see the sort of fingers of the stream system coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| And this is what it looked like in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:48| You can see that it remains relatively saturated in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| And this is what the slope analysis looked like for this property of the 40-acre area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| Over 34 acres of that are slopes greater than 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| so it's pretty steeply sloped in the areas that are within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| And again, the majority of the development on this north side ofâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| or sorry, south side of Hardin Valley Road has remained a little lower density generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| probably due to the steep slope constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| So rather than up to three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| which is what the applicant is asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| staff is recommending planned residential up to two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| primarily because of the constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| We're also recommending to deny the low-density residential sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| because there already has a rural residential designation on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| that would allow up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| So if we deny the sector plan and approve PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| what's the maximum density that's allowed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| Well, in rural residential, I think you can actuallyâ€”in the rural area of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| I think you can get up to three dwelling units an acre if you meet all those other requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| like having sewer and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| But, you know, we're recommending up to two because of the constraints of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:52| Everything else around it is one or less per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| I think, well, on this side of Hardin Valley Road, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| A lot of it has remained undeveloped or, well, I shouldn't say undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| but remains not developed as subdivisions under a planned residential or RA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| There's some MDR right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Yeah, some vacant MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| So there's opportunities for additional residential development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| This is the one that keeps referring to Chestnut Grove?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| Am I in the wrong case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Chestnut Grove subdivision abuts this property on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| And it's LDR and there's MDR right next to it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| It actually is shown as agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| so their densities would be no greater than one dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Under the ag zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| So under ag zoning, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| they have to have lots that are one dwelling unit an acre under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| There's no minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| they could concentrate all their development in the flatter portion of this property along Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| and do something like a mix of townhomes to get the density that they would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| rather than expanding all the way back into the real steep sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:32| What's the density on the subdivision across the street, across Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| What's it built out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| I think that one that shows up as one to four dwelling units an acre is an upwards of about three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| I think three something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Let's move on to item 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| This is the east side of Beeler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| This is south of East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| The subject property is approximately twenty seven point five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| And also this area has been transitioning to single family residential since the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| The average density of the surrounding neighborhoods in this area is approximately three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| However, the approved zoning density in this area actually permitted more density than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| On the sector plan, this is primarily low density residential with a small portion of the property in both the H.P. and S.P. overlays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1414)|
| 0:23:44| because of the tributaries of Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| On the USGS map for this area, you can see one of the tributaries for Beaver Creek on the rear portion of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| And along the front portion of the property, there's also a utility easement that runs along the frontage with Beeler Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:11| The staff is recommending planned residential up to three dwelling units an acre because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:21| And a sector plan amendment is not needed for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| So part of the property is across the street. Are they planning on developing that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| So we don't know since we don't have a plan at this time, but that could be a question you might like to pose to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:49| It's, I think, mostly in the stream protection area on that side of the road, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| This is actually case 16, not 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| My apologies. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Yes, 16. This is B&B Builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:15| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Any other questions? All right. Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| I'll turn it over to Jesse to review the next three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| First one up is item number 12, 5H22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| This request is residing to OB and staff is recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| Can you hear me OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Good to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| So item number 12, 5H22RZ, this property is located north of Carmichael Road and west of Valley Vista Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1546)|
| 0:26:07| The applicant's requesting a zoning change from PR planned residential to up to 12 dwelling units per acre to OB office medical and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:20| and the technology overlay district would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| As you can see in the zoning map, this would be a minor extension of existing OB zoning to the north and the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:38| This is the sector plan, which shows us as a mixed use special district for the Carmichael Road Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| The northwest county sector plan recommends office zoning for properties west of Valley Vista Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| So this is consistent with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| Some additional context, the surrounding area is a mix of multifamily residential and single family detached homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| In addition to commercial and office uses, this has been developing for the past 20 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| Of particular note is a commercial corridor at the corner of where Hardin Valley Road meets Valley Vista Road to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:19| And there is the anchor institution just north of that, Pellissippi State Community College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| This is in the hillside. Most of the property is in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| And so staff recommends approval because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| There have been a few residents expressing concern about future development connecting to Berrywood Drive, which is this cul-de-sac just to the west of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:28:00| It's of note that this rezoning case coincides with rezoning case number 5N22RZ by the same applicant, which you can see just up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:11| We've seen a preliminary concept plan which has no bearing on this rezoning case, but does indicate that this would all be developed together and there's no plan to connect to Berrywood Drive, indicated by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1691)|
| 0:28:26| TTCDA would review any non-residential or multifamily development if that was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:44| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| We'll move on to the next item, number 13, 5I22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| So this property is located south of Jenkins Road and west of Meeting House Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| The applicant is requesting a zoning change from agricultural to land residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:11| The zoning shows that this is a residential area with a mix of agricultural, low-density residential, and planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:24| The sector plan designates this low-density residential, so this is consistent with that northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| In some additional context, it's mostly detached single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| There is a church and a Quaker meeting house to the southeast of this property, as well as a recreation field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| The homes along Jenkins are very wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Residential properties do have an abundance of mature trees, and this property is within the hillside protection area and forested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:59| Staff recommends approval of planned residential because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| However, we recommend a density of four instead of five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| This is informed by the slope analysis, which recommends around four dwelling units per acre, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| And this density is more consistent with PR zoning density in the area that's been approved, as you can see, to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:26| It's PR four to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| There has been some concerns expressed by several residents about the recommended density due to traffic and runoff concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:39| and I'm happy to answer any questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| I would say the density did not trigger a traffic impact analysis, and I'm showing in the bottom there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| It's kind of small, but that's traffic counts that have been done since 2003, and it's not showing an upward trend of congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1848)|
| 0:30:58| I have a question about the density recommendation because you said to the east they have up to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| and if I'm looking at the image that's on the screen, well, that was on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| That's the large rectangular development on the far right of the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| but the property that we're discussing is abutted by which the density for that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| Yeah, this is PR at 2.7, I believe, and so I was looking at just kind of the broader area along Jenkins Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:37| and you can see it's up to four that it's been zoned to a little bit further east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| There's nothing else around it except that one development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:32:00| RA does allow lots that are up to 10,000 square feet in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| so that would be closer to the four dwelling unit per acre recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| So the other lots just haven't been built out to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| It was allowed, but they didn't build them out to that density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| Any other questions for Jesse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| Jesse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| We'll move on to item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| It's 5022RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| This property lies on the west side of East Governor John Sevier Highway just south of Old French Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| The applicant is requesting a rezoning from agricultural to planned residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| The most surrounding property is zoned agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| though there is a planned residential subdivision to the south as well as a parcel to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| that was developed as a Veterans Memorial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| The sector plan recommends low-density residential for this property as it is within the planned growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| About 27% of the property does have a stream protection classification, which was part of our consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| but the rezoning is consistent with the south county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| This area is mostly rural with residences existing on lots over an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| Across the French Broad River, you'll see there's some heavy industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| The property is also along John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| which is a major arterial that was part of a corridor study adopted in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| which has some conservation criteria we considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Most of the property is forested and there is an existing forest buffer along the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| So our recommendation is to approve planned residential zoning up to three instead of five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| as it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| The two conditions we placed on this are based on the John Sevier Highway corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| which is to maintain a 50-foot tree buffer along the highway frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| and not clear or grade until a concept plan or use on review plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| And I'll accept any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Is this adjacent to one we did last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| What did we designate that one at, density-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Yes, this is adjacent to the property here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| which we recommended a density of three dwelling units per acre and it was approved at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| We approved it at five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Yes, or I think it was 4.9 based on the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Okay, and then that, could you go back to the stream protection or floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Okay, so is that stream protection is the diagonal line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| Is that what you're seeing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Yes, that's stream protection and then here you can see this is the FEMA floodplain, 100 and 500 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| Is that a floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Not a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| A floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Oh, it's a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| So that can be filled though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| In theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Is the reason to go to three from five because of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Environmental constraints were a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| You know, planned residential is advantageous because they can conserve the more sensitive areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| but then that would potentially lead to clustering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| which might not look consistent with the rural character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| All right, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| Change computers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| While he's doing that, I just want to say I really liked the format of those particular cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| as they were being showed, breaking out the specific conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| and just the format of that discussion was really helpful, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Item number 22 is a concept plan, rock point crossing, and Mike will cover this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Let's see if the projector turns on here in a second with my presentation, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| I'm not sure why the projector is not showing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| It's on up here on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2212)|
| 0:37:08| And then it's on and then off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Well, let's see if I can try one more thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| There it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| So number 22 is rock point crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| This is at Rutledge Pike and I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| There's the Rutledge Pike interchange just to the north of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| I wanted to go through this one just because it has some complexities to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| I'm anticipating that hopefully this will be on consent, so if it does come off consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| we don't have to go through it during the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| So what this is including is a partial closure of Pelham Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| and then what they do is propose a new road to replace Pelham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| There is some access to McCalla Avenue and Rutledge Pike may have to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| but as of right now I'll show you what they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| and what we're recommending approval of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Part of the problem is that there's some ownership of right-of-way challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| It's an old area and TDA and city, it's kind of hard to know exactly what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| There's two parcels at the terminus of this new road that need to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| to allow commercial connection, and there are some zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| and subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Just real quick, the road closure, which you see in blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| is the portion of Pelham Road that's proposed for closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| that will require a separate application later for the official closure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| But if this new road is approved and permitted for construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| obviously that's a good sign that everyone's in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| that the old Pelham is going to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| That then would be absorbed into their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Obviously they'd be dedicating the right-of-way for the new road from their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| The area at the terminus of Rock Point Drive is zoned RN1 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| This is all zoned commercial and industrial around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| In order to have a commercial driveway connection to the end of this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| which is what they're wanting to do, this will have to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| to a zone that allows that use that's connecting through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| So presumably it would be an industrial-type use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| so they'll want to rezone this to either commercial or industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| to allow that commercial or industrial driveway connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| This is more of a side note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| That doesn't impact this concept plan because you can build a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| through residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| It's just really on the backside when they're doing a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| They can't connect their driveway to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| So McCalla Avenue and Rutledge Pike intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| which you can see on the right side is their new road coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| and connecting to McCalla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| The existing road connects in just to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| so it's offset from the actual connection over to Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| What they're wanting to do as part of this plan is continue to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| this little section in McCalla that comes into Rutledge Pike at an angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| So that's what you're seeing is a truck turning template in a large radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| onto McCalla over to Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| The problem is this little section of McCalla is right where the on-ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| to I-40 is, and it's not the most safe condition when somebody is pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| up to this intersection with Rutledge at a sharp angle looking back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| over their shoulder, and then you have vehicles trying to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| onto Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| So the preference is to eventually close this, if not part of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| but maybe sometime in the future, and then they would just use this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| existing connector over to Rutledge Pike and improve this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| to allow the turn movement onto Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| So as part of this, we're not necessarily saying that they can't go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| with their proposal, but during the permitting phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| during the design plan phase, they might have more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| with Citi and TDOT and determine whether or not what they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| can go through with permitting or if they need to improve that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| over at Rutledge Pike and make that right turn movement more a 90-degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| like T intersection versus this little offshoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:51| I think that's, I'm not sure if Curtis, if you know, but my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| that it's unknown who owns that right-of-way, and so that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| complicates the situation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| So this is basically all right-of-way in this little triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| They show like a little lot line going through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| but I don't think that's really a lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| I think this is all right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:25| In my opinion, it needs to go ahead and extend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| come at right angles with Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| I don't know, Curtis, if you have any comment on during the permit process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| what considerations could be done then or if the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| needs to make an action if they feel they just need to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| and make the connection all the way over to Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| or if that's something that could be considered during permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| As far as the city is concerned, I think we could go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| We were willing to try to work with the developer after concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| to look at removing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| I don't know if they had some timelines that they were up against or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| so we were trying to work with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| Either way would be fine with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| but we would like to have that conversation with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| because we see the benefit of removing that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| I think what that is is actually the old Rutledge Pike alignment is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| If you go back far enough, that's the old roadbed basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| so just a remnant, kind of an odd intersection there with the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| When it moved in and created the partial cloverleaf out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| it definitely created some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2622)|
| 0:43:51| Even if it did get constructed as they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| and this little segment of McCalla stays open for a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| there's no guarantee that it will stay open permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| The city and or TDOT could close that at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| so ultimately they might be coming out to Rutledge Pike with their turns anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:19| There's two zoning variances required to construct the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| particularly at Pelham intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| There's two existing driveways, residential driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| within 50 feet of this intersection that will require a zoning variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| If they do not obtain that zoning variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| they're going to have to either shift this further away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| or work with those property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| shift the intersection further away from these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| or work with those property owners to move their driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| So that's to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| For the subdivision regulation variances and alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| there's three different intersections that have a request to reduce the radii,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| the curb radii and the right-of-way radii from 75 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| which is a commercial and industrial standard, to 25 feet of radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| The 75-foot radius that you can see at the northeast corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| that's a 75-foot radius, just to give you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| So it's a pretty sweeping, large radius to allow the truck movements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| We don't really want truck movements going on McCalla and on Pelham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| and so staff is supporting the reduction to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| to discourage trucks from turning down those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| We want to make sure that they stay on Rock Point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| and go out to Rutledge Pike or onto their commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| and not turning down those local roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| The intersection, increasing the intersection grades are pretty common,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| and really the intent there is that we have proper ADA crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| So 2% is the max you can have for an ADA crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| and the city is okay with this request up to 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| at these two intersections, at McCalla and at Pelham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2777)|
| 0:46:27| Any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Like I said, this may not, hopefully it won't come up during the Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| but just in case you have some background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| Let's move on to item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Okay, this one most definitely will be discussed at the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| This is Parker 4 subdivision on Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| It came through for rezoning last, I guess, two months ago for the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| It was rezoned to plan residential up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| I believe the property is about 54 acres in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| so at one dwelling unit per acre they could, over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| request 53 to 54 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Right now this plan shows 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| There's 15 smaller lots that are clustered in the northwest corner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| and there's one large lot that's the balance of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| There is some concerns with Irwin Drive that we've heard from residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| Staff, we are recommending denial of variance number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| and I'll talk about that in just one sec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And just to make you aware, the applicant is going to request a 17th lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| That's what they intend to do at least during the Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| so I just want to make you aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| and I can show you what they're interested in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| Just to give a little context on where this property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| the red dot there is where the 15 lots are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| Irwin Drive kind of wraps around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| West Beaver Creek Drive is to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| We have Beaver Ridge that this property goes up on the backside of the property on the southern side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| Callahan Drive, I-75, and the Irwin Drive-Central Avenue Pike intersection is just to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| Just in case you're not familiar with the Irwin Drive-Central Avenue Pike intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| there's a railroad underpass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| The sight distance really isn't too terrible, but obviously it does obstruct some through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| The other direction, you do have a curve in Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| Again, sight distance-wide is still pretty good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| but there has been stated some concerns with that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| With their new road alignment, they are coming into Irwin Drive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| This is a private road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| Because of this curve in Irwin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| they are going to require a sight distance easement through the front of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:13| I'll show you an image in just one moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| but a significant amount of vegetation will have to be cleared to make that sight distance obtainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| On the right, you can just kind of see how the curvature of Irwin Drive is through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| It kind of makes these S-curves that make it challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| Looking to the north, this is where we're looking towards that sight distance easement issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| that they're going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| You see all the vegetation on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| It will probably require some grading, and obviously the removal of the vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| Looking in the opposite direction to the south is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| It's going to have plenty of sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Looking up here on Irwin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| this is some of the issues that we just hear from the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| There's a vertical curve on Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| It kind of limits your visibility as you're coming around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| and then it turns into this horizontal curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| In general, people have had concern with Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| They've stated there's accidents on Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| It's not a perfect road, but it is a decent road that can handle this traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| It's just something I wanted to kind of show you what they're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| but there are issues with Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3041)|
| 0:50:50| Again, that's part of the reason why the reduced density was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| versus something higher like two or three dwelling units per acre for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| Variances and alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| The denial of variance number one is they're asking for a K value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| which is this vertical curve at their entrance, a K of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| They're required to have a K of 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| and really that's going to be a fairly minor adjustment for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| That should be pretty easy for them to fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| so just go ahead and meet the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| There's really no reason to reduce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| Again, just like last time on the last project we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| the intersection grade increases from 1% to up to 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| which is a pretty common request right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| We don't have any concerns with those, the two intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| This is a private right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| They're asking for a 40-foot right-of-way versus a 50-foot right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| in a 24-foot paved surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| We don't have any concerns with those requests either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| The only other thing that's a little bit unique with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| since they do have a T-shaped driving or road system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| they're requesting that the road basically be a T turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| and not provide some other turnaround at the end of these two road stubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| Because of the length of the T, it pretty much meets AASHTO standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| We're okay with approving the variance to not require a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3145)|
| 0:52:34| There's obviously a lot of hillside on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| On the backside of Beaver Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| there's a small amount of hillside protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| On the north side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| it's going to be a very small amount of the overall area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| If they bring their driveway in as they propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| it will come through that hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| but it's not a great concern considering the large amount of hillside in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| southern part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| I mentioned that the applicant may request a 17th lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| They'll still remain well under their maximum density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| Basically, they're interested in maybe splitting lot 16 into two large lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| lot 16 and lot 17, which you see on the screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| The reason why we're not just going ahead and updating our staff report is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| there was confusion on exactly what their request was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| Their original application was for 16 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| When we got revisions, it was still 16 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Then they requested 17, and then they got plans with 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| and now it's back to 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| and so we said it would be better for them just to make this request at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| Planning Commission meeting to just go ahead and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| if they want the 17th lot, just make the request at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| and the Planning Commission can approve it if you wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:54:06| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| We'll turn this over to Michelle for item number 36, the final subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3256)|
| 0:54:26| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| So with that 17th lot, would they be able to clear more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| It seems like is it on a hillside up on the top part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Lot 16 and what is currently lot 16, which is just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| balance of the property outside of the small 15 lots, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| they could, I guess, request or get a grading permit potentially to grade up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| there, but same thing with if they split into two lots, 16 and 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| the chances of somebody wanting to grade up in that area are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| I'm not sure why they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| It's only approved for one house lot right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| so if they went up there grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| they're spending a lot of money and potential headaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| So I don't anticipate that anybody would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| But you said they're planning on building another house up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| and that's why they want another lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| No, I have no idea what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| If they create two lots, 16 and 17, which are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| probably 20 acres-ish each maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| they would be allowed to pull one building permit on each of those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| Where they put that house, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| The plan currently shows one proposed house lot near the other 15 houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| or lots that are created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| one proposed house lot on the flat area, not up on the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| They don't show where that other potential house might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| but even if they did build a house up on the hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| the amount of disturbance would be pretty low for one house in a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| It would be low?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| So that's not an existing house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| There wasn't an existing house on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| There is an existing house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| but they don't intend to keep that existing house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3384)|
| 0:56:32| Okay, so on the agenda today we have, instead of a final plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| it's been requested to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| However, the item that's on the screen now, number 29, use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| received notice yesterday that there was opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| so I'm going to kind of switch gears on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| So instead of discussing a final plat, we'll discuss this use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| if that's okay with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| This is a request for an auto repair facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| It's located on Murdoch Drive, near where the Dutch Town Road kind of turns off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| and it kind of splits and becomes Murdoch, just west of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| The parcel has split zoning, BPTO on the top and PCTO on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| Some existing land uses, as you can see, most of the land use around is office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| There's a lot of vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| There's some industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| This green area right here shows this public park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| but it's actually a multifamily development that's under construction currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| And just kind of the context, you can see the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| There are a few site constraints on the property, so there's a creek running through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| You can see the floodway here with floodplains on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| and it's designated as a stream protection area in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| There were two waivers issued by the TTCDA for this yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| One was to increase the parking spaces, so the TTCDA had a max of 142 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| They needed 144, so the increase was pretty minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| It's hidden behind a row of landscaping here, so the waiver was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| There's also, whenever parking is in front of the building in the TTCDA area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| there's a 20-foot parking lot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| The second waiver was to reduce it in this corner to 9 feet and in this corner to 19 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| due to the topological constraints on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| and to keep it further from the stream protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| There are loading dock doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| There are two on each facade, so there's the front, the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| and then actually I guess two except for the south elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| They are proposing a fence around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| You can see here, this is the plan that kind of delineates that going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| So the sides, the rear, and the other side are going to be a dark chain link fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| with plaits woven through so that it's opaque,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| and in the front it's going to be white metal panels to match the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| The landscape plan here, so you can see here the gates for the fencing around this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| and here's your front row planting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| so that's going to buffer the building and buffer the cars that would be parked here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| So the idea is that they want to make the site secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| so that the cars that are damaged for Harper Auto would be protected behind the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| but it also provides a level of screening of the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| So the opposition is opposed to the use as well as the site plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| They don't feel like there's enough landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| although it did meet the TTCDA landscaping standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| The other thing that they're opposed to is the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| and so in looking at how this was decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| the applicant met with Knox County Codes prior to submitting the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| and submitted it under Section 5.503R,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| which states that other assembly or limited manufacturing uses of a similar nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| when located and arranged according to a plan providing for aesthetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| or other conditions in harmony with the neighborhood and approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| As part of the BP zoning requirements, the applicant submitted an operation statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| and so these are some bullet points that are taken from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| so you can kind of make a determination whether you feel like the operation statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| meets the zoning it was submitted under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| They are an auto remanufacturing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| They adhere to manufacturer's specifications for remanufacturing to ensure safety and soundness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| They specialize in remanufacturing of steel, aluminum, and electric vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| They offer tooling and equipment with technological advancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| There's a team of 28 employees, which could grow to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| They anticipate between 150 and 180 work orders per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| and their normal business hours are from 8 to 5, Monday through Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| and by appointment on Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Again, just kind of looking back to that site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| the cars that are back here, obviously they're going to be buffered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| and then through here on the front, that's only going to be parked during business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| If you guys have any questions, I'm happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Yeah, so what is your staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| We're recommending approval. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| I should have left with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Yeah, and then the second question is, what is the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| What's the who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Daniel Sanders will be representing the opposition at the planning commission meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| He came to the TTCDA meeting yesterday in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| but most of his arguments were geared more towards what you all hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| the planning commission with the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Is it a contiguous person that doesn't want it built there, or is it just a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| He said he was representing someone who lived in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| but I don't know if it is a single person that lives in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| or if it is a broader group of people that he represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| It's kind of an industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| I mean, there's new buildings just like it across the street being built, so it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| That was what I was curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Is it an auto repair shop not allowed in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| or is it specifically called out that it's not allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| Well, I think that's what you guys are going to be looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| so Steve can speak to this a little bit better, but we were allowing it under Section R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| Yeah, it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| In the CA zone it does specifically call out auto repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| but in the BP zone it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| It says manufacturing, and we based it off of the Section R| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| that Michelle showed on the screen earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| One of the concerns that we had that they addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| were we were concerned that cars would be stored outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| and we've been told now that everything will be stored inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| There will be no outdoor storage of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| Is it a body shop or repair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| It's a really nice repair body shop, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| Is it a body shop, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| They're calling it a remanufacturing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| All I know it's an auto repair facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| I'm not exactly sure what the difference is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| but maybe the applicant can speak to that on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:25| Are there any other items that we haven't covered today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| that any of the commissioners would like for us to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| I guess we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| See everybody Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220510-agenda-review?start=3814)|
