| 2:34:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9246)|

| 2:34:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9274)|
| 2:34:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| 10A is an appeal by Cherokee Bluff Council of Co-Owners, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve a use-on-review for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| development plan for up to 30 residential dwelling units with a maximum of 80 bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| subject to nine conditions in an RP1 Planned Residential District property located on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| northeast side of Cherokee Trail, west of Eddington Road, in conjunction with 11X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| which is a resolution approving the appeal by Cherokee Bluff Council of Co-Owners, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9298)|
| 2:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9308)|
| 2:35:09| I have two people signed up to speak here, Mr. Seymour and Mr. Pope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| Mr. Pope, you're, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| We have got an agreement that we would ask Council to bless, and I represent Todd Kennedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9318)|
| 2:35:30| the property owner, or will be property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9330)|
| 2:35:34| Mr. Pope represents the Cherokee Council of Homeowners, Inc., if I pronounced that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| We have agreed, subject to Council's approval, that a tenth condition be added to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9340)|
| 2:35:49| approval, and I have it written out, that the applicant will dedicate a conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| easement over the undisturbed areas of the property, and this is designated in green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9356)|
| 2:36:04| here, with Legacy Parks, Cherokee Bluff Council of Co-Owners, Inc., or a like organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9364)|
| 2:36:12| as beneficiary, that will ensure the preservation of the undisturbed area of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9372)|
| 2:36:18| in its present state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| That area is delineated on Exhibit 1, which I'll hand to Ms. Mitchell in a moment here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| I would like to add to that, after discussions with Councilman Hulquist this afternoon, that, if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9388)|
| 2:36:35| the undisturbed portion here be conveyed to Legacy Parks or a like organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9395)|
| 2:36:45| Fee simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9405)|
| 2:36:46| And fee simple, rather than a conservation easement as an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9406)|
| 2:36:51| The reason I want it as an alternative is, one, we've got to satisfy our bankers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| and they are harder and harder to please these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| Second is, if we conveyed it at this time, we would lose our density, which is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9421)|
| 2:37:10| So I would simply like to add that as an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| Mr. Kennedy would love to convey it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| He receives no benefit from the conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| And I have talked briefly to Carol Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| We would have to have further discussions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9445)|
| 2:37:31| Mr. Pope, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| Robbie Pope, 1837 Cherokee Bluff Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| That's accurate representation of where we are, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9456)|
| 2:37:39| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| Comments from anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| Mr. Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| I'm going to make a motion to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| deny the appeal with the provision that this additional condition be included in the overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9469)|
| 2:38:02| And I will comment as an aside that my concerns remain about development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9482)|
| 2:38:13| The infrastructure is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| It will never be adequate for intensive development beyond what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| It's barely adequate for what's now in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| And there's another major project proposed immediately outside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9504)|
| 2:38:29| off of Eddington Drive, right around the corner from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| So we've got major problems looming because we've approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| we and county government combined, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| county commission have approved a series of developments without thinking through what the impacts will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9520)|
| 2:38:46| But that said, I think this is the best compromise solution for this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9526)|
| 2:38:54| And since the parties involved have agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9534)|
| 2:38:57| I think the only reasonable thing for this council to do is to deny the appeal with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| but in doing so require that additional exception that Mr. Seymour is entering into the record to be part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9545)|
| 2:39:13| And I think, is that the way we would do it, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| Could I suggest to you that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9556)|
| 2:39:17| Yeah, if you've got a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9557)|
| 2:39:18| Because this sounds, it doesn't sound like, it doesn't feel like it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| But I would suggest to you that you move to approve the appeal to the extent of adding this additional condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| the condition number ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9567)|
| 2:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| That makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| And then deny the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9570)|
| 2:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9571)|
| 2:39:32| My motion, let me restate my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9572)|
| 2:39:33| My motion is, as Mr. Seymour said, to approve the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| but deny all the other components of the appeal except to include in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9577)|
| 2:39:47| the appeal will essentially amend, by approving the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| all we'll do is amend the plan that was approved under use on review so that it includes this additional provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| Does that more or less work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9600)|
| 2:40:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9601)|
| 2:40:02| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| Well, yeah, I want to actually echo Mr. Holquist's concerns about the long-term development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| And I guess to go a little further, I would be, it's not my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| but I'd be supportive of development moratoriums while we develop the good plans for making that area successful in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9612)|
| 2:40:20| There are significant problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| That would be a challenge because we'd have to define the area and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| But we may be able to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| I don't think it's worth exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| Just the traffic on that road at bad times is horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| And I think just the environmental development issues are pretty significant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| I know we're making progress with some of the urban wilderness and historic corridor and all that's happening in there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9637)|
| 2:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9651)|
| 2:40:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| Thank you all for working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9659)|
| 2:41:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9670)|
| 2:41:18| Go ahead, Sandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| 11A is a resolution in support of policy governing development on the green space of the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Yeah, I guess I am talking a lot again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| I'm sure that shocks people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| I think this is a really important point of sort of how we regulate the development of our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| And I guess, I mean, I've read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| It feels like a very good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| There are a couple suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| I know this is actually a PBA plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| And I'm not quite sure what the process is for impacting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| But I'm just going to say sort of what I'd like to move and if Mr. Smith has any responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| At some level, part of this came about because there was this concern about something improper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9719)|
| 2:42:06| being built on that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| And we tried to figure out some regulations of what would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| But we also tried to figure out regulations that would stop that particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| And I think we can do a better job than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| I'd like to see an ability in this to say that if the downtown design committee has approved a design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| that we could be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| And especially this concern about it only being a one-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| I think that's a wonderful plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| I can envision things that would be better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| I just want to toss that out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| My memory might be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| But I think five members of this council have previously voted on a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| objecting to the development of the green space here at the city-county building area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9770)|
| 2:42:56| I see Councilman Pelo nodding her head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| Yes, indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9779)|
| 2:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9785)|
| 2:43:06| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| Is it Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| Mr. Ricker, are you proposing to amend the policy in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| to include some kind of review by the downtown design guidelines committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| Because something like that was essentially proposed by Mr. DeFord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| And we had the comments included in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| And his sense was adding a citizen layer of input might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| There is a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| I mean, I think my first thought would be to actually expand it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| I think as a base, I think putting in language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| and I'm glad you caught my thought that was badly articulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| that I would like to amend this to include review by the downtown design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| or the downtown design review committee and make that explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| If – yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9828)|
| 2:43:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| Okay, there's a motion to amend and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9831)|
| 2:43:52| Discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| All those in favor of amending, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| Those no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| Okay, now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| Let me – Councilman Frost really just reminded me of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| that we did do a while back, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9849)|
| 2:44:10| With regards to the green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| And now this – I guess, Mr. Swanson, the effect –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| what's the effect of this resolution on the one that was passed by –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| I guess at least five of us voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| which basically said we didn't want to see any development of the green space years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| What's the practical effect of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9865)|
| 2:44:28| Are we just going to have two resolutions that are sort of conflicting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| I know a resolution is not law, but what's the effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| I don't have the previous resolution before me to see whether they are in direct conflict with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| If they are in direct conflict with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| the more recent of the resolutions would take precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9884)|
| 2:44:51| But I don't have the one you're talking about in front of me to review it to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| I think it was about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| A policy governing development on the green space of city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| could possibly – one that says no development on the green space of the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9901)|
| 2:45:06| Is that correct interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| A policy governing development on the green space –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| that policy could be one that says, hey, after we've looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| we don't want to do any development on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| Could it say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9919)|
| 2:45:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| It could say that, couldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9921)|
| 2:45:22| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| All right, then I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| Is there any sense to postpone this for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| to get out the previously passed resolution on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| Seeing Councilman Becker nodding in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9932)|
| 2:45:35| I'll go ahead and make that motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| There's a motion and a second to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Well, I guess my question is who is going to be determining this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9942)|
| 2:45:49| Bill, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| Dr. Lons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| Well, this is a policy that PBA has begun the process on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| and we, along with the county, went through the public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| and the receipt of the comments which we have forwarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| and has been mentioned here in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| And this would be something –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| and I guess unless Dale Smith would like to elaborate on this –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| that would guide – that the county and the city would have voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| and go to the PBA board that would be used to guide any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| that would be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| I guess it would have to be on the Hill Avenue portion of the green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| So that would be basically its impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| It would be the statement of council preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| or council acceptance of concurrence with the policy promulgated first by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9991)|
| 2:46:37| Well, I do recall that when this vote was taken by the five of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=9997)|
| 2:46:43| who are still on the council, it was a very strong sentiment among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10003)|
| 2:46:49| And we wanted definitely to strongly voice our position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10009)|
| 2:46:55| And I really very much appreciated the letter Ms. Poplin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| and Vice Mayor Brown crafted this week on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| Well, we'd be glad to bring out the previous policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| and have a little more background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| and maybe Mr. Smith wants to comment or not about what the impact –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| the genesis of this suggested policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| If you would like to compare the other one to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| Clearly, I mean, if the other one was nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| something that allows something contradicts it, that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| I think we can safely say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| Bill, do you want to make any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10048)|
| 2:47:29| There was no policy, but –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| I was unaware of the resolution you're addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| I doubt that it has any real force in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| I don't think it does except express –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| Right. Oh, I understand it expresses opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| And our practice, my board's practice has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10067)|
| 2:47:52| to do nothing significant with this property or this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10072)|
| 2:47:57| without the agreement and consent of both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10077)|
| 2:48:02| I think that if we want to head in the direction I think you're headed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10082)|
| 2:48:08| I think a postponement is a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| because I think there's some legal research that my attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| as well as maybe yours will need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| I would ask you to consider our enviable role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10098)|
| 2:48:25| of trying to manage this building and this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10105)|
| 2:48:30| in the interest of both the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| and the fact that unanimity is not common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| That the ultimate –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10119)|
| 2:48:44| you know, the ultimate path if PBA were dissolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| and the ownership reverted is very, very unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10129)|
| 2:48:55| It would appear on its face the county would own two-thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| the city one-third, and you guys would be left to your own devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| to figure out what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| So I think that in regards to these policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10144)|
| 2:49:08| we've tried to navigate this in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| that appeared to be comfortable to both the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| without being overly restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| also without just sort of the laissez-faire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| that has existed regarding the green space up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| That's all I think I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| I think you're about to say what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| I think that in light of everything we heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| a postponement may be viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| because I would like to see the resolution we did vote for and pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| and also maybe at that junction two weeks from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| we can have a discussion about the genesis of this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| and also the implications, at least for us as individual council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| who have voted on a resolution in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| so that we're very clear that this may in some instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| if we vote for it, seem to show a turn of our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| And we need to make sure we're very clear on what this vote is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| This resolution here to me just says develop a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10202)|
| 2:50:06| A policy may be, hey, we're officially putting down a policy that says no development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| or maybe one that says some development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| So that may be, I think that's an open interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| So two-week postponement I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10216)|
| 2:50:18| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| It sounds like this policy might very well be in conflict with your previous resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| Ms. Pillow, is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| No, I'll just quickly say, Mr. Smith, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10226)|
| 2:50:29| when we speak, we speak with both the city voice and a county voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| because we are both city taxpayers and county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10234)|
| 2:50:38| And I think most of us take that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| So in a sense, we feel a great deal of ownership of the property and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10240)|
| 2:50:46| I understand, Ms. Pillow, and I wasn't saying anything to be sarcastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10246)|
| 2:50:52| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| I didn't read it that way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| Okay, I think we're all clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| Ready to vote? Then the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| The motion on the floor is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10261)|
| 2:51:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| All those opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10263)|
| 2:51:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10264)|
| 2:51:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10265)|
| 2:51:06| 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10266)|
| 2:51:07| 11B is a resolution authorizing Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10267)|
| 2:51:11| to study and prepare a redevelopment plan for the Magnolia Avenue Warehouse District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| within the city of Knoxville and to conduct a public hearing regarding the necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| for the adoption of such a redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| Requested by the Department of Policy and Communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| Council Member Woodhull and Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| There are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| We have several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| Mr. Frost, do you want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| I was looking at this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10295)|
| 2:51:36| Does this include the executive suites of interior finishes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| I have four folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| All signed up to speak in opposition to our rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| I'll say three, but if you will all keep your remarks brief, we'll let everyone speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10308)|
| 2:51:53| Denise Sanabria, I'm not sure I got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10313)|
| 2:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10317)|
| 2:51:58| If you'd give us your name and address, Denise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| My name is Denise Sanabria, 1153 Edinburgh Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| I'm the Vice President of A1 Lab Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| It's a very large artist organization that's located in Fireproof Storage Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| We are apprehensive about a redevelopment program that doesn't include us in a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10334)|
| 2:52:20| I mean, the owners of Fireproof Storage just found out about this meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10340)|
| 2:52:26| And we are basically apprehensive about something that might change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10346)|
| 2:52:34| the self-interest of businesses that have been there for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10354)|
| 2:52:41| And for people who are operating businesses and organizations there right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10361)|
| 2:52:48| we're looking at a very big question mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| And we don't know whether we are going to be negatively or positively affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| That is our main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| We don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| And we want to absolutely make sure that nothing is going to harm what we have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| We'll speak a little bit to that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| But that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| And I think Mr. Wetzel will get up and explain a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| And if you have some questions, we can come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10392)|
| 2:53:13| It may be helpful for them to know also this is the beginning of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10393)|
| 2:53:17| There will be a series of meetings, KCD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| Maybe can I just suggest this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| Mr. Wetzel, you want to get up and give a one-minute summary about how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| And then we'll – everybody that signed up to speak, we're still going to let come speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| But that might be a good preface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10409)|
| 2:53:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10410)|
| 2:53:31| So they understand that this doesn't grant anything that I would have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| Because there's a lot of fair questions that I think people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10418)|
| 2:53:39| What we have here is the beginning of a process to declare a Magnolia Avenue warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10419)|
| 2:53:44| district redevelopment because we feel like there's a real need there to get some redevelopment going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| And we can get into details of that at some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| The process is to – if you all pass the motion tonight requesting KCDC to create the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10432)|
| 2:54:01| then they will begin a process of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10441)|
| 2:54:05| And the next big step that comes in that process of review is a public meeting to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10445)|
| 2:54:11| And talking with Mr. Nance, chairman of KCDC, it's another part of their practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10451)|
| 2:54:17| to always contact individual property owners before you get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| to have discussions with them before you even get to the public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| So there will be a contacting with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| Then we will move to a public meeting to kind of take comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| At that time, comments will be made, positive, negative, whatever those comments were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| And KCDC will then work to draft a plan that becomes the redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10474)|
| 2:54:41| incorporating those comments, some probably into the body of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| some in the appendix of the plan that says comments received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| Maybe these are not comments we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| At that point in time, it would then come – there would be discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10490)|
| 2:54:54| It would come back to the council for you all's final decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10494)|
| 2:54:57| whether you want to create the redevelopment district or not with the plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| So that's kind of – if you start to process, KCDC gets the genesis of the plan together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| gets the outline, talks to the property owners, has a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| takes comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10510)|
| 2:55:11| After those comments, it creates – it finishes off a potential plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| brings it to this group for approval or disapproval at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| That is the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10520)|
| 2:55:21| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10521)|
| 2:55:22| I'm going to let the other folks who signed up to speak come and speak now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| but that – I just want to let people know how the time frame worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| Next is Harriet Proffitt and Preston Proffitt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| and I'll let you all come in whichever order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10531)|
| 2:55:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10540)|
| 2:56:03| Just to – since we are running on short time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10563)|
| 2:56:09| I'm going to deliver both – this is Harriet Proffitt here, who is my mom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10569)|
| 2:56:16| and I am Preston Proffitt, and we are the family that owns Fireproof Storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10576)|
| 2:56:21| and Van Company Incorporated downtown in the warehouse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10581)|
| 2:56:26| So I had just written some words regarding the matter because I was not familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10586)|
| 2:56:33| with the process that was just explained as far as with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10593)|
| 2:56:39| So, anyway, this is what I had written, and basically, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10599)|
| 2:56:48| the term redevelopment, by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| implies that the warehouse district is somehow falling to pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10611)|
| 2:56:56| and is in need of developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| And if we're talking about the area where I am, which we are the largest warehouse in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10619)|
| 2:57:10| I don't see that immediate area as being as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| Most of the businesses are up and running and have customers on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10635)|
| 2:57:22| But as vice president of Fireproof Storage, a solidly developed structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10642)|
| 2:57:29| that has been maintained by myself and my family since the early 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10649)|
| 2:57:35| I find it difficult to accept redevelopment simply based on a few facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10655)|
| 2:57:43| Fireproof Storage was built in 1923 and continues to do business as a commercial warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10663)|
| 2:57:53| The ownership may have changed over the years, but the business itself has never changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10673)|
| 2:58:01| meaning that it has continually been in the warehousing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10681)|
| 2:58:12| We are almost completely at capacity at this moment, which is approximately 150,000 square feet of area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10692)|
| 2:58:22| and we are the largest facility in the warehouse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10702)|
| 2:58:29| We have also ventured into other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10709)|
| 2:58:36| Approximately three years ago, we began providing space for A1 Lab Arts Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10716)|
| 2:58:43| in order to diversify the use of our space and, most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| to give back to the downtown area a space for like minds to gather and enjoy fine arts of all mediums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10728)|
| 2:59:00| In this short time, it has become incredibly successful, and Fireproof has been able to reach another goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10740)|
| 2:59:09| not only to be successful in the warehousing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| but also to successfully utilize some of our space for a unique and creative purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10753)|
| 2:59:21| We plan to continue commercial warehousing as well as give Knoxville a new and artistic venue to enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10761)|
| 2:59:32| and we plan for those new ventures to be successful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| We will try as hard as possible to do so to keep not only the same business going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10777)|
| 2:59:47| but to diversify and give Knoxville something else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10787)|
| 2:59:54| To me, these are new and exciting developments, so why redevelop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10794)|
| 3:00:01| When I began, I said redevelopment by definition implies that we are falling to pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10801)|
| 3:00:09| We need development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| If some structures are in shambles and not in use, they probably do need redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10811)|
| 3:00:20| But Fireproof still stands tall, a beacon in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10820)|
| 3:00:33| and reaching to the sky as if looking for new and creative possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10833)|
| 3:00:39| And that is exactly what we are doing and hope to continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10839)|
| 3:00:44| So in closing, I suppose what we need to know, and I was just helped along by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10844)|
| 3:00:51| is what we need to define is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10851)|
| 3:00:55| What is implied by redevelopment when these businesses that are around me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10855)|
| 3:01:03| it's not just Fireproof, but other business owners that, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10863)|
| 3:01:10| we're completely in control of our own fate at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10870)|
| 3:01:15| So we would like to know just exactly what is the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10875)|
| 3:01:22| and what is encompassed in this warehouse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10882)|
| 3:01:26| But, as I said before, some of these questions were just answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10886)|
| 3:01:31| and I appreciate your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10891)|
| 3:01:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10894)|
| 3:01:37| Ms. Proctor, did he speak for you as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10897)|
| 3:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| Do you have a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| Well, I did have a few words, but since we're running so late, I told him to just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10903)|
| 3:01:48| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10908)|
| 3:01:49| And we do appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10909)|
| 3:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10911)|
| 3:01:52| Mr. Brandon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10912)|
| 3:02:05| My name is Thomas Brandon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| I own 308 Randolph Street, 711 East Depot Street, and 707 Willow Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10927)|
| 3:02:19| I'm very upset about a lot of this being put under KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| It's under an empowerment area, as I understand now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| which I think should be sufficient to put this back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| I have several comments and questions that I'll read here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| Why am I being included in a Magnolia Avenue warehouse district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| Is there any intent to condemn any property to be used by private developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| or by the city or by KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10966)|
| 3:02:51| What is the definition of the word redevelopment for Magnolia Avenue warehouse district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10971)|
| 3:02:56| which has already been asked before and part of it answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10976)|
| 3:03:00| Most of the area is old, but it's fully developed and has been for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10980)|
| 3:03:07| There are older but solid buildings, most of them thriving business, employing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10987)|
| 3:03:13| One building is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| Two buildings are for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10995)|
| 3:03:18| With economic times as these, employment is the word, not beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=10998)|
| 3:03:25| Why are the occupants and owners of the buildings not notified by the city council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11005)|
| 3:03:32| This has been very upsetting to all the occupants in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| and I talked to about 12 of them the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11016)|
| 3:03:41| The proposal and redevelopment plan has long been known in the city and KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11021)|
| 3:03:47| Why is the public owners just now being informed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11027)|
| 3:03:52| An attorney has been trying to buy up various pieces of property for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11032)|
| 3:03:59| Two of these are mine at 308 Randolph and 711 East Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11039)|
| 3:04:04| Rumor is they are to be demolished for a retail and a parking lot for a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11044)|
| 3:04:13| This sounds as if KCDC has already done the redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11053)|
| 3:04:20| I just wonder, what about the state street area is vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| Why is it not being redeveloped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11063)|
| 3:04:29| The attorney, is he connected with the city, the KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11069)|
| 3:04:34| Is he a privileged contractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| Where did he go, and when did he get his information from over a year ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11078)|
| 3:04:46| The redevelopment of the Magnolia article states the loss of several large manufacturing operations in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11086)|
| 3:04:55| This has also happened in other areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11095)|
| 3:04:58| This is no excuse to run or displace the present owners out of their businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11098)|
| 3:05:05| or buildings for the benefit of a few developers or whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11105)|
| 3:05:10| and to make the area in a beautification place, keep people in their jobs and their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11110)|
| 3:05:17| I am against this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| When KCDC becomes involved, owners lose control of their investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11119)|
| 3:05:26| I believe that the taxpayers' money should be spent on more viable and beneficial products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11126)|
| 3:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11132)|
| 3:05:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11133)|
| 3:05:36| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| Like has been indicated by Councilman Frost, I am in this redevelopment, proposed redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11138)|
| 3:05:47| My property, my piece of property adjoins two of Mr. Brandon's properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11147)|
| 3:05:54| And he is correct that there is somebody trying to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11154)|
| 3:05:59| And I have signed an option agreement to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11159)|
| 3:06:05| And I'm sure that if, in fact, he goes through and purchases the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11165)|
| 3:06:09| he would like it to be in a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| But that's somewhere down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| I personally, if I continue to be the owner of the property, do not want to be in a redevelopment district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11175)|
| 3:06:22| because in all these redevelopment districts we've seen in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11182)|
| 3:06:27| we're giving control of people's property to a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| They don't have any investment in that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11192)|
| 3:06:35| And I, for one, because I have invested my hard-earned dollars into this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11195)|
| 3:06:41| don't feel that I need KCDC or the city of Knoxville to tell me how I need to do to develop my piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11201)|
| 3:06:49| The business that I'm in, I'm in a construction company and I have a warehouse office in the warehouse space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11209)|
| 3:06:55| I could be at that location, if I so desired, for another 50 years and it would still function just fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11215)|
| 3:07:01| with just minor maintenance of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| And so I personally don't understand what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11224)|
| 3:07:08| I do share some of Mr. Brandon's concerns that sometimes these agreements do appear to get into agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11228)|
| 3:07:18| to force people to sell when they're not so inclined to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11238)|
| 3:07:22| So I oppose this wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11242)|
| 3:07:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11246)|
| 3:07:27| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11247)|
| 3:07:28| Mr. Woodhoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| What I like about at least starting the process to ask KCDC to study it is that it becomes a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11250)|
| 3:07:40| and it becomes a public process where all the comments and concerns and aspirations of that particular community are compiled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11260)|
| 3:07:52| and listened to and heard and processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| I haven't experienced KCDC controlling and limiting possibilities like in the old, what's the north district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11275)|
| 3:08:07| the downtown north redevelopment district, which has been a great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| And we chose to move on that particular plan, which I saw it not as a way to control people's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11292)|
| 3:08:21| but as a way for the city to say, we'd like to partner with you to get what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11301)|
| 3:08:29| I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| This is the beginning of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| And that's how I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| I think beginning the process is worthwhile, especially if it means connecting a lot of the downtown energy with Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11314)|
| 3:08:45| And there were comments about the word redevelopment suggesting that the buildings were dilapidated or not nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11325)|
| 3:08:52| Actually, I think they're wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| I think a redevelopment area only works if you see the areas, the buildings and the assets in the redevelopment area as opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11334)|
| 3:09:08| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11348)|
| 3:09:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11349)|
| 3:09:10| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11351)|
| 3:09:12| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11352)|
| 3:09:13| First, I don't necessarily agree with all the comments that the speakers made, including Councilman Hall, about the KCDC issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11353)|
| 3:09:20| But the question for Councilman Hall, is there a fuse on the options to purchase the property when they will expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11360)|
| 3:09:28| Is there an event that will trigger the options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11368)|
| 3:09:33| Just time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| No, they're not conditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| It's not conditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| Mine is not conditional upon anything other than time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| And I have just recently extended it for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11382)|
| 3:09:48| So, towards the end of May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11392)|
| 3:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11393)|
| 3:09:54| But there are several other property owners involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11394)|
| 3:09:57| I don't know how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| Ten, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| And what terms those expire on, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11400)|
| 3:10:06| And I've just been informed, because I do have a financial interest in this, I'll have to abstain from voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11406)|
| 3:10:13| I do oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11413)|
| 3:10:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| Mr. Ross, would it be prudent, and I don't know if this is for Dr. Lyons or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11417)|
| 3:10:24| considering there's an extension on some options to potentially postpone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11424)|
| 3:10:31| What are the pros and cons to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| Well, I want to make clear that this redevelopment area has been something we've been talking about independently of any project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11434)|
| 3:10:41| Prior, I think, both with Vice Mayor Brown and Councilman Woodhull in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11441)|
| 3:10:46| asking, you know, with the action we've had moving to downtown, north and downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11446)|
| 3:10:51| and as Councilman Woodhull said, when can we start extending this energy out toward Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11451)|
| 3:10:57| And even if the project that has been referred to, which we are, of course, aware of, were to go away tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11457)|
| 3:11:03| we think this redevelopment area is worth exploring, which is all this starts doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11463)|
| 3:11:09| So I would not want to tie it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| It is not conceptually tied to any specific development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11471)|
| 3:11:15| So what are the cons to delaying this until these options run their natural course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11475)|
| 3:11:23| Well, I think the only con is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11483)|
| 3:11:26| it delays a process that I think some in the community would like to see in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| By beginning work on this redevelopment area, even if it's there and not enacted upon immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11492)|
| 3:11:41| the one thing we do know is there's interest in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11501)|
| 3:11:45| We have some vacant lots where TDOT has gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| We've got new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11508)|
| 3:11:49| We've got development opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| We've got areas that we think that the natural development process toward the east, which we think is critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11511)|
| 3:11:59| and down Magnolia, and there's a lot of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| and we've had the task force looking at Magnolia and its development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11521)|
| 3:12:05| that getting the toolbox in place is a good idea, and this would just delay that being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11525)|
| 3:12:11| I think in practical terms, it may well be that it wouldn't make any difference at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| but we thought this was a good time to go ahead and round out the core of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11535)|
| 3:12:21| the redevelopment areas in the core of the city that would help radiate out from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11541)|
| 3:12:25| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11548)|
| 3:12:29| Actually, Mr. Frost, I think there's sort of a disadvantage and a delay in this because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11549)|
| 3:12:33| this is, to be clear, just the beginning of a study about whether we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| I mean, keep in mind there's another vote of counsel that has to happen before any action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| and especially that, again, the possibility of these public discussions that are leading to the development of a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11562)|
| 3:12:49| allow the folks that have showed up tonight to answer some of the questions that they've asked about what this means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11569)|
| 3:12:56| I think it's actually I was really impressed that there are so many people in on the front end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11576)|
| 3:13:01| We've done lots of development districts where we don't hear a peep from anybody until two years after it's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11581)|
| 3:13:07| and in a way this is really exciting that there are four people who came the moment they heard about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11587)|
| 3:13:12| with seeing some opportunities and some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11592)|
| 3:13:16| My sense of the process on this is that the questions that got asked tonight by the four speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11596)|
| 3:13:24| will be answered in the development district that KCDC develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11604)|
| 3:13:29| and they, the four people here, will be at the table making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| So I think moving now makes a lot of sense to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11612)|
| 3:13:37| Now, as far as the legality of those options, I'm not sure what the answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11617)|
| 3:13:43| but I think moving forward now makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11623)|
| 3:13:47| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11627)|
| 3:13:48| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11628)|
| 3:13:49| I think also moving forward now makes good sense for the reasons stated by Director Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11629)|
| 3:13:56| but also because in delaying it based on these potential options that were just brought forth tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11636)|
| 3:14:05| first time I've heard about those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11645)|
| 3:14:06| it somehow implies that this project and or this potential study is tied to some particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11646)|
| 3:14:13| and I wouldn't even want that implication put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| And if we delay it in saying we want to see what happens with these options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11655)|
| 3:14:19| it kind of makes it sound like that kind of development is what's keying this or the catalyst to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11659)|
| 3:14:24| and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| You know, as people long know, even before this current makeup of council, back even under the old council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11666)|
| 3:14:32| I've always talked about how we must develop those arteries that are flowing into downtown also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11672)|
| 3:14:37| Magnolia, Broadway, Central, those major arteries, Chapman, Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11677)|
| 3:14:43| that are flowing into downtown as we develop downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| And now is the time to begin to talk about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| So I would not want to delay for fear of putting or even implying that somehow any option that any particular person may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11688)|
| 3:14:57| is the catalyst or contingent upon how we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| So I don't want that specter even brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11700)|
| 3:15:03| So I would like for us to just move forward with authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11703)|
| 3:15:06| or asking KCDC to begin their public process of defining out what this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11706)|
| 3:15:12| and letting those property owners who are in that area know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11712)|
| 3:15:15| and those neighbors who are in that area know and the community know that this is what a redevelopment district is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11715)|
| 3:15:20| this is what it could potentially look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| this is what we would propose for city council to consider to vote up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11722)|
| 3:15:27| and these are the pros and cons, the benefits and the liabilities of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11727)|
| 3:15:31| And I think once we have that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| we'll all be in a better position to see if this makes sense for further development of this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11733)|
| 3:15:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11740)|
| 3:15:41| Seeing no further lights, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11744)|
| 3:15:45| We'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11747)|
| 3:15:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11748)|
| 3:15:49| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11749)|
| 3:15:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11750)|
| 3:15:51| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11751)|
| 3:15:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11752)|
| 3:15:53| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11753)|
| 3:15:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11754)|
| 3:15:55| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11755)|
| 3:15:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11756)|
| 3:15:57| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11757)|
| 3:15:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11759)|
| 3:16:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11762)|
| 3:16:03| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11763)|
| 3:16:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| I heard six ayes, two nos, and an abstention from Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| 11C is a resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11770)|
| 3:16:14| to design and implement a form for appeals which fully comports with the requirements of the city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11774)|
| 3:16:20| relative to the filing of appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11780)|
| 3:16:24| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11786)|
| 3:16:27| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11791)|
| 3:16:32| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11792)|
| 3:16:33| I'll just give a real brief explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| The current appeal form at MPC doesn't really comport with city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11795)|
| 3:16:41| It has been used as an argument against the city in the past in trials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11801)|
| 3:16:49| and I always believe try to take care of your attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| Give them as solid a record as you can on matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| Make sure you pay them on time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| And this simply is trying to remove the arrow from the quiver of an attorney that, you know, is coming after the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11818)|
| 3:17:08| So, to be clear, we're not voting on paying lawyers, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| I was wondering what it was about, and that's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| You know, I would hope that in the future we don't need resolutions that do something that makes perfectly good sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11840)|
| 3:17:25| and I appreciate Councilman Frost for the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11845)|
| 3:17:27| but that seemed like something that maybe we should have jumped on and plugged the hole up, you know, in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11847)|
| 3:17:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11851)|
| 3:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11852)|
| 3:17:33| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a proposal with the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11853)|
| 3:17:38| for State Route 33 Henley Street Bridge and approaches widening from Main Street to Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11858)|
| 3:17:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11865)|
| 3:17:46| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11866)|
| 3:17:49| I met with Mr. Hunter at TDOT's regional office here a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11869)|
| 3:17:58| Maybe I should wait until I get the attention of Council so I can say this, but I better not because we're so far into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11878)|
| 3:18:03| so I'll let them go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11883)|
| 3:18:07| We had a discussion about this two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| I met with John Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11889)|
| 3:18:12| As everybody who's dealt with him knows, you can't get any better than him in terms of TDOT project managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11892)|
| 3:18:18| He's a great guy and great to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| And I asked him if he could possibly provide some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11900)|
| 3:18:26| We discussed the Henley Street Bridge project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| He provided a lot of information, including copies of the design document as it exists now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11909)|
| 3:18:36| all of certain pages of which every council member now has in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11916)|
| 3:18:41| And he also agreed to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11921)|
| 3:18:44| And not only did he come, but he brought with him Fred Quorum, who's the regional manager for Region 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11924)|
| 3:18:55| and Travis Bricky, the public affairs officer for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11935)|
| 3:18:59| And I just feel really bad because if I'd known I was going to subject them to all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11939)|
| 3:19:04| and keep them here this long, I probably wouldn't have invited them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| But they're here, and I'm very grateful for them coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| And, Mr. Hunter, if you wanted to step up to the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11950)|
| 3:19:15| I'll try to get you out of here as quickly as possible after all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| But he and I talked about the issues that the resolution that council passed more than a month ago now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11958)|
| 3:19:28| in terms of context-sensitive solutions for the design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11968)|
| 3:19:34| and mitigation efforts to try to mitigate or minimize the impacts of the bridge closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11974)|
| 3:19:41| which could be 18 to 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| We talked about that, the design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11984)|
| 3:19:47| John, you may want to say something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| It's nearly 90 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11989)|
| 3:19:53| The bridge design is roughly 90 percent complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| and the bridge closure could take up to 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=11995)|
| 3:20:01| Up to 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| Up to 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12003)|
| 3:20:04| Just, you know, we're working to make sure that we shorten that as much as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12004)|
| 3:20:09| But I want to make everybody aware that it could be up to 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12009)|
| 3:20:13| So, we still have a tremendous concern in terms of can that be mitigated at all as far as impacts on the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12013)|
| 3:20:20| and especially businesses on Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12020)|
| 3:20:22| Because a lot of businesses can go out of business even in a year's time of significant business loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12022)|
| 3:20:29| much less 36 months if it goes that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12029)|
| 3:20:33| So, I don't know that we, I mean, they're committed to working with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12033)|
| 3:20:37| and, of course, Mr. King and his department and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12037)|
| 3:20:42| and everyone involved in the city administration in trying to find the best mitigation efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12042)|
| 3:20:47| But it's going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| And as far as the context-sensitive solutions part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12049)|
| 3:20:53| I think the thing that we really focused on was just the pedestrian capacity of the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12053)|
| 3:20:58| and can it be dealt with like the Gay Street Bridge was dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12058)|
| 3:21:02| where you have sidewalks with barriers so that pedestrians have some sense of security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12062)|
| 3:21:07| and it's a pedestrian-friendly environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| And we don't even know at this point if that's possible to get into the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12069)|
| 3:21:13| because of how far the design has gone and some questions about load capacity and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12073)|
| 3:21:18| If we were to go back and look at doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| you would actually have to go back to the SHPO, State Historical Preservation Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12080)|
| 3:21:24| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| That could take up to two years to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12085)|
| 3:21:29| We are adding an extra lane on the bridge with bringing this rehab back up from the arches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12089)|
| 3:21:37| That lane actually takes traffic coming from Blount Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12097)|
| 3:21:41| which already has about a 75-foot to 100-foot merge lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12101)|
| 3:21:47| takes that all the way across the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| and ties in with the lane that's already on the north side of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| So it essentially takes that three lanes northbound all the way across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12114)|
| 3:22:00| I think if TDOT had had a formal request to look at the pedestrian issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12120)|
| 3:22:06| and the separation kind of issue that I was mentioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12126)|
| 3:22:11| they would have taken that on in the initial design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12131)|
| 3:22:15| and at least considered it, but that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| And so I know that there were suggestions that came out of MPC and TPO for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12138)|
| 3:22:22| but somehow that never materialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| And so they never got that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12145)|
| 3:22:29| I thought that they had, but I wasn't in the loop on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| So they never got any requests from TPO or from the city, and so that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12152)|
| 3:22:38| So, John, you had said that it might be possible to re-stripe at a later date if we wanted to add bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12158)|
| 3:22:45| I mean, not that TDOT would agree to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12165)|
| 3:22:48| but that could at least be looked at once the bridge is reconstructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12168)|
| 3:22:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12173)|
| 3:22:54| During the time that we're reconstructing the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| we can work with city engineering and look at possibly doing some re-striping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| instead of putting a sixth lane, possibly doing bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12180)|
| 3:23:04| which could give you pedestrian separation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12184)|
| 3:23:09| What about the option of going back later and putting a barrier on if the structure will allow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12189)|
| 3:23:16| I know you had to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12196)|
| 3:23:17| That would be a later project to go through SHPO and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12197)|
| 3:23:20| But is that something that could be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| Could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12202)|
| 3:23:23| That was my impression from our earlier conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| Well, again, I think that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| I wanted to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12208)|
| 3:23:29| Council asked that that be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| I believe we've done the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| And, again, Mr. Hunter and certainly Mr. Quorum and Mr. Bricky also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12214)|
| 3:23:39| And, by the way, Mr. Bricky joined us for some of that conversation a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12219)|
| 3:23:43| So I'm very grateful to them and their cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12223)|
| 3:23:46| And, Ms. Pelow, your point two weeks ago about how I've never disagreed with you about their cooperative nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12226)|
| 3:23:53| I just wanted to make sure that we had a chance to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12233)|
| 3:23:56| I'm just so glad you had the opportunity to sit down with these gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| I've dealt with them many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| Extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12240)|
| 3:24:01| Never been disappointed in my dealings with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12241)|

| 3:24:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12252)|
| 3:24:13| I just wanted to give them their chance to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| They sat here for three hours, more than three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12255)|
| 3:24:18| Okay, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12258)|

| 3:31:29| And I think they have to get their program up and operational on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12689)|
| 3:31:33| We're delayed, not really due to their part, but because of some building issues early on in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12693)|

| 3:36:38| Unfortunately, what I think you saw tonight, Mayor and Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| was a demonstration of how weak your management is at Knoxville area transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13002)|
| 3:36:47| and how weak is your KTA board that you all have selected to represent you in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13007)|
| 3:36:55| Let me give you an example of what I define as weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13015)|
| 3:36:59| While we were sitting here and you were going through some of your discussions about a variety of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13019)|
| 3:37:03| I looked at the last five meetings that they have on their websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13023)|
| 3:37:08| You've got a nine-member committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13028)|
| 3:37:11| In August 28th meeting, you had five members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13031)|
| 3:37:15| September 25th, you had five members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13035)|
| 3:37:18| October 23rd, you had eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| December 18th, you had six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13042)|
| 3:37:25| November 18th, you had no quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13045)|
| 3:37:28| So the minutes couldn't even be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13048)|
| 3:37:31| Many of you know I've called you time and time and time and time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13051)|
| 3:37:36| you're shaking your heads yes, about this KTA board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| You've got some members on this board that have been there over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13061)|
| 3:37:46| some double-digit years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| They are not serving you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| The questions that you all asked tonight during your first hour should have been asked by this board numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13071)|
| 3:37:58| many opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13078)|
| 3:38:00| They sit there mute, not knowing what questions to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13080)|
| 3:38:05| They don't hold the CAT staff responsible or accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13085)|
| 3:38:10| and then your general manager gets before you and has to answer issues that are just so minor and basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13090)|
| 3:38:18| such as what are the responsibilities of the KTA board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13098)|
| 3:38:22| It's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13102)|
| 3:38:24| Policies, fares, schedules, and oversee all for higher transportation in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13104)|
| 3:38:30| That's a simple answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13110)|
| 3:38:32| Now, I'm not criticizing you, but my point is you've got people that you all are appointing here over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13112)|
| 3:38:38| and the mayor's bringing the nominations, and you all are ratifying them without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13118)|
| 3:38:43| You've got some members on here that are appointing until 2011, 2010, 09, December of 09,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13123)|
| 3:38:52| and they are not serving you all well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13132)|
| 3:38:54| I think you need to look at yourselves for not properly vetting these people when they come before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13134)|
| 3:39:00| and also, quite frankly, I think you need to ask for some of their resignations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13140)|
| 3:39:05| It's a volunteer board, and if they don't want to serve, if they can't serve all good people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| but if they can't serve, get them off the board and get somebody that can serve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13150)|
| 3:39:15| This could have been eliminated tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13155)|
| 3:39:18| This was totally unnecessary that this would be brought before you all in the way that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13158)|
| 3:39:22| because this board had the opportunity to ask the same questions that you all did, and they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13162)|
| 3:39:28| Well, first of all, obviously, by their attendance records, they weren't there to ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13168)|
| 3:39:33| Please give this some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| Get some people on there that want to serve, that can serve, that ride the buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13175)|
| 3:39:40| and so what happened tonight cannot be eliminated again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13180)|
| 3:39:44| where those discussions can take place at KTA meetings as they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13184)|
| 3:39:48| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13188)|
| 3:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13191)|
| 3:39:52| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13192)|
| 3:39:53| Mr. Smith, I don't necessarily disagree with anything you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13193)|
| 3:39:56| but just as you know, the KTA board has very little power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13196)|
| 3:40:02| It doesn't control personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13202)|
| 3:40:04| It doesn't control money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13204)|
| 3:40:05| If you don't control personnel and you don't control money, you don't control a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13205)|
| 3:40:09| And I'm not saying that in defense of board members that don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13209)|
| 3:40:12| I'm just saying it's not as meaningful as it might be if they had real control over the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13212)|
| 3:40:21| Would you allow me to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13221)|
| 3:40:22| Actually, the public forum is not set up to go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13222)|
| 3:40:25| You all are welcome to continue that conversation, but we do need to kind of stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13225)|
| 3:40:29| If I may, Mayor, I think there's a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| See, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13231)|
| 3:40:32| This is a conversation, not arguing with you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13232)|
| 3:40:34| It's your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13234)|
| 3:40:35| You control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13235)|
| 3:40:36| But these are things that should be said on the record because people need to know you're putting people in positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13236)|
| 3:40:41| that are not representing you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13241)|
| 3:40:44| As you said, you're putting $8 million in the transportation system where there's no reason these issues that talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13244)|
| 3:40:51| it's not about the lift service, that's directly in the control of the KTA to ask those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13251)|
| 3:40:57| and hold that management accountable, and they're not doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13257)|
| 3:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13263)|
| 3:41:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13264)|
| 3:41:05| Thanks, everybody, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13267)|
| 3:41:08| Jamie, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13268)|
| 3:41:10| It wasn't what you signed up for, so I kept trying to call on you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13273)|
| 3:41:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13275)|
| 3:41:16| I finally got to the right issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13276)|
| 3:41:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13277)|
| 3:41:18| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike, representing the Tazewell Pike-Beverly Station Neighborhood Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13278)|
| 3:41:25| and I'm here tonight after speaking with the rest of my block captains today to ask for your help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13285)|
| 3:41:31| and your support regarding a property called Joshua's Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13291)|
| 3:41:35| on which the city annexation was final in December of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13295)|
| 3:41:41| Tomorrow, County BZA is again going to try to resurrect 38 invalid dead building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13301)|
| 3:41:51| against the county law director's advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13311)|
| 3:41:54| As I understand this, BZA cannot do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13314)|
| 3:41:57| The permits have lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| BZA does not have the power to do what they're being asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13320)|
| 3:42:04| If the county chooses to do the wrong thing, and in my opinion, the illegal thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13324)|
| 3:42:12| the city must not give up its responsibility to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13332)|
| 3:42:16| I'm asking for clarification of the city's policies and practices, and I'm asking for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13336)|
| 3:42:24| There are two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13344)|
| 3:42:26| Number one, is it the city's policy and practice to follow the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13346)|
| 3:42:32| and require building permits for new home construction on land annexed into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13352)|
| 3:42:38| when there are no valid legal county building permits in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13358)|
| 3:42:45| And number two, if for whatever reason County BZA chooses to act illegally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13365)|
| 3:42:52| by extending long-ago expired county building permits on land already annexed into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13372)|
| 3:43:00| will the city automatically honor the illegally extended county building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13380)|
| 3:43:07| and not require city building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13387)|
| 3:43:11| or will the city protect the taxpayers and require city building permits to be obtained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13391)|
| 3:43:20| This is the city's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13400)|
| 3:43:23| In a case where it is very clear under county law these permits have lapsed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13403)|
| 3:43:30| they are invalid, they are dead, they cannot be extended or revived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13410)|
| 3:43:37| if County BZA chooses to act illegally by breathing life into these permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13417)|
| 3:43:45| it is even more imperative that the city have a clear policy consistent with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13425)|
| 3:43:53| that permits be obtained in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13433)|
| 3:43:57| I'm not asking the city to blindly take my word or anyone's word on the legality of the County BZA's actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13437)|
| 3:44:05| If County BZA votes tomorrow to extend the building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13445)|
| 3:44:10| I am asking that the city not automatically accept County BZA's position and the county permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13450)|
| 3:44:19| I ask that the city administration and that city council review the circumstances regarding these permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13459)|
| 3:44:28| and put into writing the city's decision regarding requiring or not requiring that city building permits be obtained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13468)|
| 3:44:38| and the rationale behind that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13478)|
| 3:44:44| This is the position we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13484)|
| 3:44:46| The county law director has told Councilman Frost that County BZA cannot legally extend 38 building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13486)|
| 3:44:56| because those permits have lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13496)|
| 3:44:59| The County BZA is simply not empowered to resurrect these dead, expired permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13499)|
| 3:45:06| But that may well be what County BZA does tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13506)|
| 3:45:10| The city would be taking on all the liability while allowing the county development and stormwater laws to be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13510)|
| 3:45:20| in a very, very fragile watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13520)|
| 3:45:24| The city taxpayers deserve the protection of the city laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13524)|
| 3:45:30| The city has already issued at least seven notices of violation on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13530)|
| 3:45:36| ranging from inadequate erosion and sediment control measures to grading on city property without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13536)|
| 3:45:44| TDEC has fined them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13544)|
| 3:45:46| What it gets down to is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13546)|
| 3:45:49| As citizens and taxpayers, our neighborhood will live with the government decisions based in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13549)|
| 3:46:00| What we are not willing to live with is having not one but two local governments fail to enforce their laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13560)|
| 3:46:12| If, indeed, the County BZA acts illegally and breathes life into these permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13572)|
| 3:46:19| will the city stand up for its citizens by enforcing the city laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13579)|
| 3:46:25| and require city permits no matter what the County BZA decision is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13585)|
| 3:46:31| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13591)|
| 3:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13594)|
| 3:46:35| I guess Councilman Roddy and I were wondering why she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13595)|
| 3:46:38| I guess we know the answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13598)|
| 3:46:40| Very briefly, last week, Mrs. Rowe, who resides in the district I represent, called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13600)|
| 3:46:46| And I'd heard about, you know, this is an area that has clearly been inside the city for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13606)|
| 3:46:52| This came up at last month's County BZA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13612)|
| 3:46:57| The attorney for the developer acknowledges that these permits have, in fact, expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13617)|
| 3:47:06| The property is now within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13626)|
| 3:47:08| They were not able to get them renewed at last month's meeting, and they're going to try, you know, yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13628)|
| 3:47:17| I would tend to think that these properties are inside the city, have been such for many, many months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13637)|
| 3:47:27| and that it is the city's responsibility and duties to be the one that not only issues the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13647)|
| 3:47:35| but does all the work related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13655)|
| 3:47:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13659)|
| 3:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13660)|
| 3:47:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13661)|
| 3:47:42| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090127?start=13662)|
