| 0:08:29| at 969 Fox Lake Drive, Knoxville. Officer Husky. No applicable record. Ms. Martin. We're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| waiting on copy of the sales tax registration, the corporate charter, certificate of zoning from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| MPC, and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=521)|
| 0:08:49| Councilman Rawley. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Swanson, I would like to know is this the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| lemongrass that is in Merrillville? Yes, that's the same. Excellent. I hear you have a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| restaurant. Thank you. And I was going to ask you if you were in any way connected with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| the New China Buffet. No, we don't have any related. No relationship? No relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| Well, I'll move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| Any discussion? Councilman Becker. My feeling is as I heard the list of what's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| there were a couple things that were under the applicant's control there, and we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| move towards a policy of not acting on things until everything the applicant has control of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| And I don't have any problem with it. It was a corporate charter and sales tax registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| because the zoning actually has to come from MPC. So there are two items that are wholly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| under the control of the applicant here that have not gotten in. So just my tendency would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| be to postpone this, but I'll go along with the will of council or the board on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| Any further discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=598)|

| 0:10:14| Hi. Hi. Could you give us your name and address, please? Sure. My name is Carla Perez. My address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=614)|
| 0:10:29| is 1712 McLean Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912. Officer Becker. No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=629)|
| 0:10:38| Ms. Martin. We're waiting on approval from the Fire Inspector Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| task program certification and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=642)|
| 0:10:52| Councilman Becker. Have you done the task program, the alcohol service training? No yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| It's kind of mine, too. You're close. Just talk to me a minute about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=659)|
| 0:11:16| why you have not been in for the task. The reason is because the class is just a whole 25 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| and it was already full. I have to wait until the next week. When did you apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| Three weeks ago. Officer Husky, would that be a correct statement? The last class we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| was full, but the ones before that were not. When did you make arrangements to take over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| ownership of this establishment? Are you an owner? Yes. About three weeks. So it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=705)|
| 0:11:55| a very brief time. It's been in between them. Yeah. What's your status right now? Is the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| open? No. It is closed? It is closed. When was it closed? Well, it has been closed. I don't open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| yet. I'm waiting to have all my permits ready because I have been having the health and beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=730)|
| 0:12:20| permit. What would your hope be of when you open? Well, when I get all my permits ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=740)|
| 0:12:29| Is that a week from now, a month from now? I would plan two weeks more until I get the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| class and get all my permits ready. I already talked to the inspector in the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| I'm waiting for him next Thursday and the fire department the same way. This is not my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| but it's adjacent to my district. And I'm sorry, but I didn't realize the vice mayor wasn't going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| to be here. And I did not look. Where is that location? It's 4329 Lonas Drive. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=773)|
| 0:13:01| that. So give me some sense of it must be near. It must be near to. Near Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| Hollywood. No, it's near Hollywood and Middlebrook. Oh, it's just almost in my. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=789)|
| 0:13:19| I don't know. I would assume that that store is important to that neighborhood. And I hate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| have you have to wait a month, but the task certification is just such a critical issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| with this council. So I'd like to hear more council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| Councilman Bailey, she won't get her permit until she turns in all her documents. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| think that's what our conclusion was, but in our workshop. But what can I hear him again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| Fire inspector and health department approval. And she's already indicated that that's scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| task program certification. And I understand those classes are offered weekly. So she could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| go any Thursday and the final business tax return from the former owner. And we can assist her with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| that when she's ready to open. Well, I'll make the motion to to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=846)|
| 0:14:14| Well, I'll second that motion. And, Ms. Perez, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| Yes. I would hope you would free yourself and your manager up to go. Yeah, I will be myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| I get a policeman who told me to be there really early just to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| sign it and get a seat in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| Any councilman Becker? I think I'm going to oppose this one because I think the task is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| so important. And it might I would hate for this one to be denied, although this is a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| approve. If we fail to approve, is it denied? Mr. Swanson, it can we postpone if we fail to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| approve? If you fail to approve, it's still on the agenda and you can make a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| if that's what you do. Thank you. Oh, councilman. Yeah. Thank you, officer. These classes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| weekly. And is it first come first serve? It's the it's the first twenty five. That's that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| all the state will allow the first twenty five to show up the first twenty five to sign in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| they can start signing in at seven a.m. OK. Classes at 10 a.m. OK. Thanks. Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| And you're going to go down there next week and take the class. And I just want to this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| this week, this Thursday, I'll be there. Thank you. I'm sorry. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=939)|

| 0:16:33| Officer Husky. No applicable record. Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| fire inspector and health department and task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Councilman Pilo. Oh, my. Have you attempted to apply for the task certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1003)|
| 0:16:59| No, ma'am, not yet. What's your planned opening date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| We're looking at late October if construction and inspections go as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| Oh, Councilman Becker. I'll move to postpone until the next board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1029)|
| 0:17:26| Second. Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Well, that's not going to hurt your opening date, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| I'm not certain I'll have to ask council. What council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| Our corporate council. Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| Pardon? Is corporate council here, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| No, sir. Can I hear those again, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| the ones that are outstanding? Final approval from the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| fire inspector and health department and task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| I think the next meeting, the October meeting is October the 23rd, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1080)|
| 0:18:09| It's not that late in the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Well, I don't want to give anybody any special treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| but I do think we ought to treat everybody consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| And I think that's why we had the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| And I don't know really any difference between this one and the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| And so I'm not going to support the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| I just think we ought to. He's not going to get his permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| until he does what he's supposed to do. And so I'm not going to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| I had a comment to make. I think I will not do that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| So the motion is to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1125)|

| 0:20:44| And we're just appreciative of the opportunity to share our community and our religion with Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1244)|
| 0:20:55| And I want to say how much I appreciate you all for making it easy for us to come here and get the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| And I want to especially thank Wanda, first of all. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| I understand I saw Harry Moskos today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Harry's back in town, and I'm sure he's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| You haven't gotten him to do, like, the dunking booth, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| I think I'll stay away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Oh, Councilman Apelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Well, just on personal experience, I will just comment that I think there are more Greek Fest signs sprouting in the yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| in the area that I drive than there are political signs this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| So I think it's obvious that you have made yourselves well-known, so it should hopefully bring a lot of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1310)|

| 0:22:06| Randy Anderson, 210 West Columbia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1326)|

| 0:22:13| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| We're waiting on the sales tax registration and approval from the building inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| Yes, Ms. Anderson, what is your relationship to Aretha, I believe it is, is it Rita, Aretha Humphreys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Rita Humphreys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Rita Humphreys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| That's my stepmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Your stepmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| And does she have any involvement in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| She's my financial backer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Is she going to play any part in the operation of the business itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Other than helping me financially to get started, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| I've gotten some information that there was a concern raised about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| So I'm just trying to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I understand that if she were to be involved that that might compromise the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| If she's your financial backer, is she an owner or is this a loan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| It's a personal loan to me because this is in memory of my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| And, Mr. Swanson, there's no, the fact that a loan is involved is immaterial to our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| It's only ownership that we can look at, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| That's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| Cash and carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1434)|
| 0:24:07| Could you give us your name and address again, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| My name is Abdul Hadi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| I'm Moldovan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| My name is 929 Shamrock Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| No ethical record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| We're waiting on the sales tax registration approval from the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| fire inspector, health department, and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Well, I appreciate you all holding off on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| I, there may have been concerns expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| but I have not heard from anyone in the community about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| as it has come before the billboard this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| So, I really don't have any reason or rationale for anything other than a move to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| given the constraints we're under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| So, I'm going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Subject to final documentation, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| I think Ms. Martin has a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| We brought to you at your February meeting Daytona Knights at 4412 Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| that was approved, and they were granted an extension of time May 22nd and July 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| They need another extension of time, and he is here to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Yes, it's Brantley Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| It's 4412 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| We're ready for inspections right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| All the contractors are there as we speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| and we had a couple of inspectors come through there and point out a few things that we need to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| But we're ready for a final tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| So, how much would you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Another 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Oh, absolutely, before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| And last, we were asked to place on the agenda tonight for your possible review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| and consideration Taco Del Mar at 2110 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| This had been deferred previously, and no one appeared at the August meeting, and the application was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| But they're here to see you and ask that it be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Mr. Chairman, I was called by an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| this gentleman that I assume is stepping up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| asking that we at least bring this back up before the rear board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| And I agree to do that, at least for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I'm not sure if I'd be prepared to make any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| We'd have to have a motion to reconsider, which would require, I believe, six votes in order to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| And then, of course, we'd have to reconsider and make a determination if we chose to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| I'm going to let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Apparently, they've gotten their liquor permit with the rationale that, hey, we've got our liquor permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| therefore why deny us a beer permit, even though they are too close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| He disagrees with the measurement, the distance requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and whether or not the measurements are within the parameters for the offset from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1661)|
| 0:27:51| But I'll let him speak and introduce himself, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Blake Fultz, 5650 Eagle Crest Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| I just want to ask that you, we were not aware that the deferment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| my assistant had indicated that we were going to be deferred to the October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| and there was a communication breakdown between her and Wanda's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| and I'm not sure we would have appeared last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| But the reason why we had deferred to begin with was because there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| the beer board did not have an accurate measurement or a measurement at all from the Thaxton school to our location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| And the point of interest in the way the law read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| we don't occupy the part of the building where they took the measurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| and that's where the disagreement was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| So we were going to defer it until the measurement came in from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| and I'm not sure whether that did or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| I just want to ask that you do reconsider and let us, allow us to obtain a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1734)|
| 0:29:05| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| So you have a liquor permit right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| What type of liquor are you serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| We're not going to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| We're only going to serve wine only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| We're going to serve the little single-serve bottles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| and the reason why is because when you serve a single-serve bottle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| the little, I think they're seven and a half or eight ounces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| you have a better opportunity to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| Because we're, you know, it's like a Mexican Subway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| and that's what we own a lot of Subways, 115 stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| and any liability at all we want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| We hope, you know, somebody comes in and wants a glass of wine with their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| their little bottle of wine, then they can have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| You know, and we're not a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| We don't have a bar top nor bar stools, and we're going to serve very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| In fact, we're going to serve a Chardonnay, a Zip and Dale, Bud Light, Budweiser, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| We just want to have it as an option as required by our franchise agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| I'm just curious, you know, assuming we reconsider this, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| wouldn't it be to be put on a future agenda because we don't have any of the packet of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| for the property to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| I mean, I'm kind of wondering, you know, there's the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| Well, there's the distance to Thaxton, and there's also Thaxton School Branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| which I don't know its proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| Officer Husky has something he needs to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| I had no idea that they would be coming before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| so I don't have current background checks on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| So I just want to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Counselman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Mr. Swanson, what is the policy in regard to an establishment that has a liquor license, ABC license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| The distance requirements under our code are not applicable in any instance where they have a liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| That was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| I guess I want to we also don't have any documentation showing that that ABC license is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1871)|
| 0:31:21| Do you have that documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| We do not have anything on the liquor license, but I do have the beer permit application file with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| I guess maybe my thought was do we have documentation in regard to when that ABC license was received by this establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1893)|
| 0:31:48| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Well, I'm asking, but I was primarily asking if we have that documentation, and apparently we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| We don't have it in the file yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| You may have had notification, but do you all want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1918)|
| 0:32:07| To me, that's a key issue is that we have documentation available to us to indicate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| that would change the manner in which we treat this decision as a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| I spoke with Ms. Day this morning, and I asked her, we went through to make sure that the file was 100 percent complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| and I do have documentation that all the background checks have been completed with the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| and the file should be complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And as far as the ABC permit goes, the state issues a permit number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| And they don't actually mail you the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| They email you that number, and the state inspector and the, I want to say a federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1965)|
| 0:32:55| it may be a federal inspector for the alcohol, tobacco and firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| They both come in, make sure everything is good, and they give you that permit number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| I understand that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| We, I believe, it's customary for us to have documentation indicating that that application has been received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| and has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Would I be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Wait one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Ma'am, if he wouldn't have a liquor or wine license, they would have given him a license to hang on his wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| And I believe he received, you received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| And I think what we would need would be a copy of that so that this council would be certain that that had been issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2011)|
| 0:33:40| and then that would perhaps change your position thus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| I mean, I can provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I was under the assumption that Ms. Day had already received a copy of the ABC permit, and I apologize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| I think that would be your responsibility to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Well, when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Sorry, sir, but I think that's your obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Now, what is the background on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I know, I remember you being here, and I remember the distance being in question, and then what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| What did we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| What did we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| You deferred it because someone from the city had not given you the information for the correct measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Does anybody know when we last measured it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| I mean, we don't have any documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| That's probably the big problem here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Yeah, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| We don't have anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| And you've been open, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| You know, I'd like to help you, but, you know, it's sort of the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Spare the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| We don't have anything to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| So you probably just have to wait until the next beer board meeting, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| Well, I was deferred the first time by council, if I may add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| I was deferred the first time because the city had not made the measurement as requested by the application office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| It's not my requirement to measure the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| The city did not do it, and, therefore, you all postponed it and didn't give me a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| And in the meantime, the law director had indicated that there is no measurement requirement at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| because I have a wine permit by the ABC, so that distance is not even applicable in the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| Mr. Chairman, Chairman Hall, I don't know how we answer that back to him officially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson if he has an opinion on this, because I'd like to help him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| but if we don't have any answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| It appears to me that you have three options available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| One option is to do nothing, in which case you'll have to apply for a new beer permit and go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| That's option number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Option number two is move to reconsider, and if that motion passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| then someone could move to postpone until the next beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| and you get before you any documentation you want between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| That's option number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Option number three is motion to reconsider, and if that motion passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| then there could be a motion to approve subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| and that final documentation would be the receipt of the ABC license from the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| I think any of those three options are available to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| and you as the beer board need to decide which of those options you feel most comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| Any of them are legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| It's clear we don't have the background check, so this beer board is not going to approve this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| So I think our only options are to make him apply again or reconsider and postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| You thought you weren't coming up until October anyway, so it doesn't feel like that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| That's the reason you gave for not showing up at all these meetings in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| So it feels like a motion to reconsider and then postpone it to the next meeting is logical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| and I guess those are two separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| I'll make the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| The motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion to postpone any action on reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| It will be reconsidered at the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting, which I think is October 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I hope you understand, sir, that your documentation is critical for us making the decision that's going to be in favor of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2285)|
| 0:38:15| Yes, ma'am, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| It certainly is with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| And that is your responsibility, and these ladies will help you, but that's your obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| And I absolutely understand, and I wouldn't ask you to approve it, but can I make a statement from a citizen standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| To go through the beer permitting process, we've never done this before and did not actually really want to even do it to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2310)|
| 0:38:40| And the fact that there's different departments that are involved that we have to depend on, like the fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2320)|
| 0:38:52| I got a fire inspection on a Tuesday and had to request an additional inspection for the beer permit that is exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| The inspectors think it's crazy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I mean, they laugh about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| In addition to that, the task class that everybody thinks that's so important, it is important if you're given a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2344)|
| 0:39:12| I've got three people on that that have to take the task class that do not have the time to take that class if they're not going to be given a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2352)|
| 0:39:22| So if they're given a beer permit pending the task class, then I'll send them to go get that task class, and then we can get an additional permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2362)|
| 0:39:30| It's hours, and, you know, the task class is required before you get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| And I was told specifically that that was fine, that we could take the task class if we were approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2375)|
| 0:39:45| But that's the only thing missing from our file is the ABC number and the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| And it's just very, very frustrating that I was postponed the first time because someone in the city had failed to take a measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| And now I'm getting postponed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| But we're trying to assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| And the important thing is that we have a big responsibility to the community, and we have policies that we have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| So we understand the frustration, but we need to have your sense of commitment that your employees and you are going to take the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2413)|
| 0:40:24| That is crucial to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| And I understand, and I would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| So we're giving you another opportunity without having to apply for a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Well, I just, you know, with the ABC permit and the task class, I mean, it should be approved pending those two things turned into the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| And once that's completed, the permit should be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Just for the record, when did you ask us to reconsider this for tonight's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| Well, to be honest with you, I called once we got the ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| When did you request this to come on the agenda for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| After Ms. Day told me that I needed to go back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Just for the record, I mean, I just want to make sure that before the next beer board meeting that we do have an accurate measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| And I just, however, we need to funnel that back through the channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| I mean, if that's a question, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| It's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| I mean, the law director will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| You're out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Clarify that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| I will be glad to ask engineering to go back out and measure, but I have a measurement in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| And we will even ask him to show us where, what part of the building he is occupying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2492)|
| 0:41:44| And we'll ask it to be remeasured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Councilman Froth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| You said something a couple minutes ago about you didn't want to apply for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Did I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Our franchise agreement with Taco Del Mar requires us to sell beer and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| And just to clarify one other thing, if I may ask the law director, is the measurement for Taco Del Mar, is that measurement necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2525)|
| 0:42:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Any questions from beer board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Mr. Swanson, just for clarification, does the distance requirement apply if somebody has an ABC permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2539)|
| 0:42:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| As I said earlier, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| That's a moot issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| I misunderstood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| Now we're going to have some administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| O'College Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| My name is Mike Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| My address is 156 Chapman View Drive, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| You're here because you've had to endure sales to minors and to present us with a plan of what you intend on doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| We turned in a basically what we were going to do is have each and every employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| We already have every employee has an ABC card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| There's a 60-day requirement because we do serve liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| If we have a new employee that comes on board that has already previously served alcohol by the drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| they have to immediately have an ABC card, and we do not let them start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| If they have never served liquor by the drink, they have 60 days to obtain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| All the employees that we have and ABC checks us on a regular basis all have ABC cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| which means that they've taken a state-approved class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| We'll keep that documentation very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| What we were going to do in addition to that is have each employee basically sign an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| that they will card every single person before they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| The one that happened in March, the employee did card the person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| and she just transposed a number and made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| The one that happened in November, we had an individual who we were carding at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| which had been working for over three and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| and we had a person get through that person that was doing the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| and they went to the bartender, and then the bartender did not card them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| So our policy has changed twice, and the policy is very, very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| and we'll have all the employees sign an agreement that they will card every single person, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| and they will check for a second ID if they're not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| and if they're still not sure, they absolutely just will refuse service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Thank you, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Sir, our records here from the Knoxville Police Department indicate that your two offenses were less than a year apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| and that the individuals were not carded on either occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| I was there on the march, and the girl pulled the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| It was what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| Officer Husky, can you clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Our cadet was not carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| I've said this before in these kind of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| You serve an incredibly fragile population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| and to have two citations less than a year apart when neither individual was carded is irresponsible in my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2751)|
| 0:46:00| Furthermore, in your packet here of your remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| there seems to be some disagreement as to whether or not an employee is terminated after one offense or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| The memorandum indicates that they're terminated immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| but the contract that you have each employee sign indicating that they understand your policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| says that they're terminated if it's the employee's second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So what is your policy in that regard, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Well, what I did is I got some information from the drug commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2783)|
| 0:46:37| I got some guidelines that they gave out and talked to them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| I'm a member of the C-7 Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| I'm a member of the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| And I'm very involved in all these things, and we talk about these every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| There's police officers that come down, and we take this very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| And I was almost, until just now, completely convinced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2820)|
| 0:47:09| and it must have been a complete misunderstanding, that the girl did card the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| And I was there that day, and I thought that she did and she just made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| And that's my mistake for misunderstanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| I think our policy, both this person and the one other time that it happened five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| were long, long-term employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And, you know, based on this guideline that I got, I do feel like that maybe a three-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| or four-year employee might deserve an opportunity to redeem their self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Your policy is what's stated in the employee contract, that they're terminated after a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| Well, I wanted to discuss that because that was one of the things that I put in my memo was saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| if the suggestion is that that's not strong enough, I will take that suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| and change it to immediate termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| If, you know, everyone feels that that's the way it needs to be, then that's the way it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| I'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| I was trying to use some guidelines that I felt like, you know, were suggested that other places use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| Well, serving, not serving underage patrons is not a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| It's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Well, I agree with that a thousand percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| These two are five months apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Neither time were they carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Are these two employees still with your organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| I'd be interested in hearing from the rest of the members of the Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Yeah, I want to agree with Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| My sense is always if somebody comes up and they have two violations and they didn't card either time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| we need to take serious action because this is a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| The only opportunity, the step we take is sending people to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| And, Mr. Swanson, my understanding is that us sending to a hearing does not guarantee the suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| or revocation of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| It sort of just moves it in the next process along, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| That there's action will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| What the severity of the punishment is not a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| If you move to send it to a suspension or revocation hearing, it will move to a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| At that point, if the parties reach some agreement that we'll successfully resolve it without a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| that's a possibility in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| It's certainly not necessarily true one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| It just takes it out of this arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| I would like to move this to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Well, I just want to say that I think you can tell by the tone of your board that this is unacceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| especially around, as Ms. Roddy said, campus, that fragile environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| I can also tell from listening to you how seriously you take this, and I think you really get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| So I'm going to kind of hope, I'm going to support you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| and I'm going to try to hope you'll support me and make sure this never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| We're very, very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| I think we've owned the business for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| And we have had, and it is very, very serious that we've had these two in this short amount of time, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| But overall, we have been very aggressive, and we've only had, and if I misspeak this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| I'm 99.9% sure we've had three in five years, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| So we've been very, our track record, our overall track record is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| And I'm there six days a week, six or seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| You know, we preach this stuff to the employees, and I cannot personally card everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| but I can talk to every employee and just drill it into their head that we're not going to tolerate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| It is unfortunate sometimes that employees make mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| and it makes it hard to terminate an employee immediately that might have been there for three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| and even passed another sting and done a good job in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| And they make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| It hurts me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| It hurts the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| It hurts the reputation of Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| It hurts everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| And we're serious about it, very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| Councilman Hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| This is in the district that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| And I know Mr. Clark, and, you know, he's, we've been together at Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3106)|
| 0:51:54| Merchants Association meetings and C-7 design review or C-7 board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| And I believe him to be someone who cares very much about the Cumberland Avenue area and about the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| I have a lot of respect for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| That said, I think it would be, it puts me in a difficult position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| because I agree with Councilman Roddy that the gravity of this is, it's serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| And she's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| It is a fragile population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| We deal with it, and I deal with it, almost constantly, especially in the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| And so I think it would be hypocritical of me to, just because I know him personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3153)|
| 0:52:41| not well, well, but know him pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I mean, I've been around him, and like I say, I have a lot of respect for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| But I think I voted for sending others on to suspension revocation under the same circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| And I don't think it would be fair to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| And I don't think I would be fulfilling my responsibility if I didn't take this equally seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| and give it the same amount of gravity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| So this is a tough one for me, but I guess I'm just going to have to vote yes on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| I'm sorry, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| I hope you'll understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| No, I do understand, and we take it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| And this is not a we're in a little different situation than, let's say, a corporation, a large, large corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3199)|
| 0:53:30| We're family owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| We have our life savings in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| This is not a hobby by any stretch of the imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| And I put a lot, a lot of time, effort, and hours in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| And I can't be there 24-7, but, you know, I'm there 70-plus hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| Councillor McNeill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Well, I find this to be a very difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| This is a very fragile population, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| And it also adds to the complexity of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Because while it's a fragile situation and we're trying to protect everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| we realize that it's a very difficult situation in which to operate a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| And you're right, people do make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Something was said earlier about you wanted some guidance on how to handle your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| And, you know, I don't want to tell you how to run your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| I just don't think that's our responsibility at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Well, I didn't want you to write my policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| No, but I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| I feel very uncomfortable doing that because, you know, my husband and I are business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| and that's a decision we have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| So I have difficulty making rules for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| You have to find what works for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| And if it's not working, it has to become more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| But I just, to close this, because we're about to need to have a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| This is a very difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| I agree with Councilman Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I really believe that you are serious about what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| I have been in some Fort Sanders council meetings with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| And I personally don't feel that this does rise to the suspension revocation situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3318)|
| 0:55:28| simply because of a lot of extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| But I think someone made the comment in fairness to other people on how we have treated them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| I think it may be something that will assist you in talking to your employees about how very seriously this council takes this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3337)|
| 0:55:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| We have a motion to send in a second to send this to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Well, you know, if you could chop me in two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| Did you say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Oh, that sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Did you say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| I just, I said aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| It's one of those times I'd like to just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| The vote was seven to one to send you to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Will I get notification on when that will be and that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| VP, mark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| My name's John Nukakatz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| My address is 1517 North Shorewoods Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| You're here because you've had two underage sales to minors and to present us with a plan as to what you intend to do to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3406)|
| 0:56:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| Basically, we've got, you know, five or six steps here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Keep a log of every single birth date, no matter, you know, how old or young they are, you know, 21 to however old people buy beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3422)|
| 0:57:12| And then, you know, every transaction is recorded by video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| And all employees there, the four of us that work there, know the rules and know the card of every single person in there, even on, you know, game days when it's pretty obvious that somebody's 50 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3439)|
| 0:57:33| And then the fake IDs, we take them all up and keep them under the register, and everyone that's fake is taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| Don't give it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| And we have ID signs on every single cooler window that has alcohol on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| And on the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| And then took the training class a couple months ago, and that's pretty much the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3470)|
| 0:58:01| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| I noticed the remedial plan is dated December 21, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| What's your policy regarding employees who are charged with serving to an underage person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3498)|
| 0:58:26| Well, basically, I was actually, I'm not the owner, but I was the one that got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| And he just said I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| It was on camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| I looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| Just made a mistake that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| He wasn't that disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Obviously, there was disappointment there, but it was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| It's not like I just sat back and just sold it to him, not looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| If I would have done that, I probably wouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| But you don't have a formal, the owner does not have a formal policy regarding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| No, there's like no formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| But, I mean, I would guarantee I probably wouldn't be working there if I didn't look at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Like if I just sold it to him without checking the ID, he probably would have been gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| I would have liked to have seen that as an element of this remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| So when this, March of 07, when you got charged, did you write the date down wrong on the log?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3557)|
| 0:59:25| No, actually, I wasn't logging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| There was a line, and I just looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| I even said it to myself in my head, and I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| And then the lock on the cash register requiring the employees to hit an additional button to confirm the birth date of the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| How did that not keep you from selling to this person if you had the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| Well, I guess that night, I mean, I was just doing it fast, hit the button, and then I looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| So it was like instead of doing it the other way around, you know, looking at the ID first and then hit the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| So other than the line in this remedial plan that says it's the sincere hope of the permanent holder that these will eliminate the possibility, this remedial plan doesn't do anything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3598)|
| 1:00:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Councilman Hookless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Commissioner Huskie, these two items, two violations dated 11-1705, same person, same date, same incident, just two different violations, same no time separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3616)|
| 1:00:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| That's an off-premise permit, so they have to ask for ID, and he did not, so that's a separate citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Mr. Chairman, this is one of those I guess could go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| I think it's been pointed out by a couple of council members, at least a couple of your board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| that there doesn't seem to have been much effort to really put together a good updated remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| So I'm going to make a motion that we send this on to suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3661)|
| 1:01:10| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| We're going to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Are you all addressing the do you want to address the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070924?start=3675)|
