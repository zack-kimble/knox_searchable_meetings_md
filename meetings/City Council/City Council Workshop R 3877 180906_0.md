| 0:00:30| Well, we have a quorum and it is 530. So let's begin this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| I'll call it to order and ask Councilman Andrew Roberto to lead the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=39)|
| 0:00:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=47)|
| 0:01:04| Well, thank you. Thank you all for coming tonight. This is a workshop regarding the Gateway Urban Wilderness Gateway Park project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=64)|
| 0:01:14| which I am not as familiar with as I hope I will be after this information session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=74)|
| 0:01:23| But I will now turn it over to David. Oh, I'm sorry. I always forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| Councilman Kampen. Here. Councilman McKenzie. Here. Councilman Ryder. Here. Councilman Roberto. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| Councilman Saunders. Here. Councilman Singh-Perez. Here. Councilman Starr. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| Councilman Welch. Here. Now, I will turn it over to Mr. Bryce to bring us up to date on what we're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=100)|
| 0:01:51| Great. Well, I will be relatively short. We'll turn it over to Rebecca Jane Montgomery, who is the city's urban wilderness coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| and Brandon Pace, who is the lead designer with Sanders-Pace Architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| We're excited. This project team, up on the screen you'll see Vaughan & Melton, Port, Sanders-Pace Architecture, Equinox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=126)|
| 0:02:17| and Gresham Smith and partners along with the city and obviously all of our community partners, kicked off in December of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| And so we are here to present the vision framework and the concept designs for what is a really exciting investment in our parks system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=145)|
| 0:02:36| I do want to obviously talk about the partnerships that have brought us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| The urban wilderness is an incredible amenity and our partners, Legacy Parks, Iams Nature Center, the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| the Aslan Foundation, Knox County, and obviously City Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| That's the Urban Wilderness Alliance that works on these projects collaboratively and have brought us really to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| This city park project is important as it lays the groundwork for what James White Parkway can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| and the connections it can make from South Knoxville and the urban wilderness all the way into downtown across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| And so we have, again, started this public process really the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| The team came together in December of 2017, had over 1,000 contacts with members of the public and stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| We've tried to do unique outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| We had a very interactive and unique public meeting at the end of the parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| It was a hot day, but it was well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| We've reached out to the immediate neighborhoods and then the neighborhoods, other neighborhoods throughout South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| So I'm going to turn it over to Brandon at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And I do want to introduce, excuse me, there's lots of city staff here who have been involved in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| We have Becky Way with Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| We have the Office of Neighborhoods, Debbie, Jim Hagerman with Engineering, Aaron Browning, and Cheryl Ely with City Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=241)|
| 0:04:11| Obviously, Dr. Lyons and the mayor's office have been heavily involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| So I'll turn it over to Brandon, and we're excited to show you where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Thank you, David, and thank you, council, for giving me a chance to talk about this project that we're extremely excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| I want to start by talking about the schedule a little bit and show really how far we've come to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| and also talk a little bit about how far we have to go in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| So where we are right now, as David said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| we were contracted to provide a visioning and programming strategy as a part of an initial contract with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| and so that work started in January, and we had a series of stakeholder meetings and workshops and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=289)|
| 0:04:59| to gather input on the project, which has brought us through to where we are right now here at the beginning of September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| where we're about to start phase one detailed design, and I'll explain what the phasing strategy is here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| But I want to start by talking a little bit about the outreach and engagement process that we undertook with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| We've done quite a bit starting back when a stakeholder group was identified early on in the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| so the stakeholder group includes the Urban Wilderness Alliance that David talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| also other people like Baker Creek Bottoms and South Doole Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| and groups that are directly associated with the project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| So we started by presenting really project priorities and getting feedback at a stakeholder workshop that happened in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| and then we came back to that stakeholder group and presented a framework plan and got feedback from them during that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| And running kind of parallel with that, there was, starting in May, a survey that was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| I think we had 800 responses or something like that, so a really, I guess, well-attended survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| So some of the questions and things that came from the survey were things that informed our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| as we were establishing what that framework would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| And then David also mentioned that public meeting that happened at the terminus at James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| I know some of you council members were there and attended that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| so that was something where we saw that as an opportunity to really show the potential of this space at the terminus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| at the end of James White Parkway and what kind of opportunities we could have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| So there was an access cut into the fence, for instance, to connect back through the trails that would go back into Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=393)|
| 0:06:41| So this was really an input session where we had scale models showing some of the framework stuff that we had come to at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| And then running, I guess, over the course of the summer, we did a series of neighborhood roundtables, we called them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| and this is where we identified neighborhood groups that were in two categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| One was groups that we called the Adjacent Neighborhoods Group, which are groups that are directly associated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| the four neighborhoods that touch the Phase I project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| So we had two meetings with them and followed that also with a Gateway Corridor neighborhood meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| which that roundtable was for neighborhoods that touch future phases of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and I'll get into the phasing in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| And also our involvement, Rebecca Jane was on the Baker Creek Area Vision Plan stakeholder group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| and so we were involved in the beginning meetings and at the end as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| and had a couple of separate meetings with them as well just to make sure that our plans were aligned with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| And then there's the open public meeting, which will happen a little bit later this month as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| And another thing that this process was attempting to do was to become kind of a clearinghouse of past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| and current projects that have happened within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| So we wanted to make sure that we were aware of all of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| the great work that's been done to date within the urban wilderness and that our study was informed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| So with that, I'll move on to the framework, and I'm going to start kind of at the 30,000-foot level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| and then zoom in to what is defined specifically as Phase I of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| So Knoxville's urban wilderness, when we looked at this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| we're looking at the entirety of the urban wilderness, not just at the project boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| And we identified really the four key challenges that we see, the lack of a primary access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| the unclear sense of entry, connectivity is lacking between the loops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| and then obviously we have varying identities across those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| So we saw this as an opportunity to address some of those challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| and what you see here on this slide is the project as it was given to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| so the request for proposals focused on this area south of Sevierville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| where the property transfer was in motion with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| So we looked at that and looked at that as a potential connection point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| between the Battlefield Loop and South Loops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| and then we also started to look at the other planned future connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| including the G&O Trail and Smoky Mountain Railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| and then we saw this urban wilderness gateway as something that could do a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| than what it was originally described in the request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| It could be something that could provide a connection to outside of just the urban wilderness itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and connect over to Morningside Park and connect over to some of the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| and planning that's happening that's in motion on that side of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| So it really becomes more than just a Baker Creek Preserve kind of park project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| or an urban wilderness park project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| It's more of a city park in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| So with that idea in mind, we looked at the corridor of James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| and we see the 2.2 miles of urban infrastructure that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| overbuilt urban infrastructure, which comprises 113 acres, if you take it in its totality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| and seven crossings that exist across and underneath that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| So there are a lot of opportunities to provide neighborhood connections within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| and the big two anchors that exist at Morningside Park and Baker Creek Preserve at the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| So we set about to create an agenda for how we would work on the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| and what really our goals for the project would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| and it starts with the big picture idea of the transformation of those northbound lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| of James White Parkway into a continuous bike and pet greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| And when we think of it in that way, we can think about this as a processional opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| from urban to wild, so as the name urban wilderness kind of signifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| And we're going to define a singular corridor character, try to unify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| and punctuate the corridor with these unique moments, experience, places, points of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| and connection points to the existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| and of course we're going to green the corridor as a part of all that big picture idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| So with that kind of foundation or framework in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| we started to consider this urban wilderness gateway project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| as more than just this threshold moment at Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| but instead as something that provides this processional experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| along the entire length of James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| so it becomes really the 2.2-mile stretch of gateway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| so that's where the name urban wilderness gateway park kind of comes from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| So if we think about this 2.2-mile long linear park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| if we think of it in those terms, we think about these connections that we can make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| a series of primary access points and secondary access points into the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| and those access points are connected by continuous amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| things like wayfinding and greenways and all the types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| that provide that consistent connection across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| And those provide access to program nodes and parking within the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| and this is important because when you think about Baker Creek Preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| and the pressure that you have at the terminus of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| and if you go there on the weekend, you see all the cars that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| it's because all the amenities are there, everything's at that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| So long-term, we want to try to establish a vision that distributes some of those nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| some of those amenities, and also some of the parking resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| along the length of this new linear park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| I think long-term, too, distributing those experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| throughout that 2.2-mile section is going to be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| That's 2.2 miles is long, and so if you're going to come from downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| you think of the future science museum, you think of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| how can folks come and experience this transition from urban to wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| along that entire 2.2 miles is going to be really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| Yeah, and that connection across to existing resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| like the parking that happens over at the Pacific Coliseum site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| So when we look at the project then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Task 1 and 2 was specifically the visioning, the framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| where that was established, also the conceptual design of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| So with that framework set, then we developed a phasing strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| and this happened kind of coincided with the mayor's funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| of the $10 million projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| We have to define what can happen within the first phase of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| and what we can do in future phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| And it's important that this framework was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| because these are the negotiation tools as well that the city can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| to speak with TDOT to be able to make sure that we establish the rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| and access to this corridor long-term so that this can jump to future administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| and they can kind of pick the ball up and run with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| So Phase 1, the Phase 1 project that we've defined right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| which is in that $10 million funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| does have the area south of Sevierville Pike down into Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| This is the area that has been transferred to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| so the city now owns that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| There's also an area north of Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| which David and others with the city have been able to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| the ability to have a grading permit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| So what that does is it provides us the ability to cut a hole in the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and provide an access from James White Parkway into the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| so that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| And then the other negotiations that are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| are part of what's going to give us the rights to do the future phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| which include going all the way across the river up to Anita Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| I guess by right or by fee transfer, and then across the river ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| So just while this slide is up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| the $10 million capital project is really focused on that middle section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| which is Cottrell and then the end into Baker Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| The future phase is something we're working with TDOT on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| TDOT has transferred in fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| They've conveyed the dead end, the undeveloped dead end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| past Sevierville Pike to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| That took several years and significant partnerships among many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Urban Wilderness Alliance, Legacy Parks, the city, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| the governor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| We've presented this model to TDOT along with some base traffic engineering numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and TDOT feels comfortable with that future phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| They want more engineering done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| but the future phase would be something we need to work into the TPO potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| or some future funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| So what we're considering tonight really will not affect the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| over at the Civic Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| No, it will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| And so I'll talk specifically about these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| and I want to start by talking about the future phase projects first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| so that we can kind of, again, look big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| and then we'll zoom into what is defined as the Phase I project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| So on the slide you see here the blue area is Phase I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| so I'll get to that in a minute, but I want to talk about 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| which are these areas north of the terminus up to Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Anita Drive, and then across the bridge ultimately to Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| So the success of this really depends upon that first step I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| which is the transformation of the northbound lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| and that becoming a greenway long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| But as a part of this as well, if you look at the existing typical section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| we have southbound lane of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| which has the width to be able to accommodate more than just two lanes of traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| So we have southbound, northbound, and we also have Cottrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Cottrell Street is a city street right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| so this area in between is able to be accessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| once we have the acquisition of the northbound lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| whereas we have private ownership across the western side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| So in the future phases, in the built-out phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| we transition that traffic to two-way traffic along James White Parkway southbound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| and then we have two different greenways, each different character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| So the Cottrell Greenway that we're showing is within the boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| of existing city-owned property along Cottrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| and some of that work can happen as a part of the first phase of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| and that's where we provide that connective tissue to connect into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| So that provides that key access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| and the character of that greenway will be more urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| So it will be more like a sidewalk and more like a neighborhood connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| whereas the character of the greenway taking up the northbound lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| will be something a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| So if we look at this slide, this is the area, the terminus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| and then James White Parkway comes on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| So future phases, James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| right now James White Parkway comes straight through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| and it's the road to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Future phases, James White Parkway's terminus is actually at Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| That's what it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| To get into the park, you will turn left and get into the park systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| You'll have to make an effort to turn into the Urban Wilderness Gateway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| So the two greenways that you see here on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| the Cottrell Greenway with the character I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| and then the greenway that's going to take up the northbound lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| So these greenways start to frame opportunities for new program spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| and I'll talk about that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| But the character of the space, the future phases of the project, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| are going to be unified in the way that wayfinding works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| that signage and all that type of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| but also in the character of how the infrastructure can be repurposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| and become something that takes advantage of the width of ownership along that 113 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| And then these program opportunities include things like dog parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| or outdoor classrooms or different spaces that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| distribute those program moments, so distribute places that people want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| outside of just that concentration at Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| So moving on up then, up towards Anita, we have the connection at Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| So this is an important connection down to the existing commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| that happens along Sevier Avenue, existing bike lanes that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| So we have the ability, actually as a part of Phase 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| to take Cottrell all the way up to this area and provide that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| So if you want to go to Alliance and go ride or vice versa or go to Sonotaco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| you can make that ride all on a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| So moving on across then, we occupy the east side of the James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| or the South Knoxville Bridge, and our hope is that the combined Cottrell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| and James White Park greenways come across at this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| and that this becomes something more than just a direct connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| between Morningside Park and Anita Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| but something that actually is a space that you want to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| So you can experience those great views looking west towards downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| and looking east towards the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And moving into Morningside Park, then you have that connection into the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| which Morningside Park is a beautiful park and I think probably an underutilized resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| We provide that connection here and also a connection down to Ned McWhirter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| So we have parking resources that exist there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| We don't have to create new parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| And we have that access point to take us over to West Knoxville as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| and the greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| So this all becomes something that becomes unified as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| and part of what is this Urban Wilderness Gateway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| So now I'll talk about the Phase 1 projects more specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| So, again, Phase 1 is defined as the area at the terminus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| So this is the zone that is the grading permit, we call it, with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| So that's where they're allowing us to change the character of that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| The area south of Sevierville Pike is the area that is owned by the city at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| So we'll break this into four zoom areas here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| One at the terminus and two at the park drive and greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| Three is the Tilson Connector and the existing Play Forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| and then on into Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| And then Cottrell Street I'll talk about as a part of the first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| So it's important to talk about circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| and what the first phase circulation impact is to James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| And when we look at the southbound lanes of James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| and the northbound lanes as they sit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| as a part of the first phase of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| there's no change to James White Parkway moving from this point up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| As you come down James White Parkway right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| you're directed to the intersection with Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| So as a part of phase one, you will just turn off into Urban Wilderness Gateway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| So blue is vehicular circulation and orange is pedestrian circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| So moving on through from the terminus into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| the blue again brings vehicular traffic on through the area south of Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| So we have beautiful groves of trees that exist right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| As a part of the early phases of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| we mapped out some of those groves of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| We've now located significant trees within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| So we're directing the alignments through this park drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| that would extend through there to take advantage of those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| And we have the greenway as well that extends between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| And as this comes on past Acre Street and down to Decatur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| that park drive starts to have nodal parking incorporated into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| So this is a two-way drive that allows us to distribute some of the parking needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| away from right now where people are parking on private property, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| And that's not going to happen long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| We're not going to have the ability to park within Baker Creek Bottoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| which is an area that has insufficient parking as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| So it's important that we are able to provide the ability to access parking at South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| So in our discussions with the principal at South Doyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| he's perfectly open with this being a shared resource that we can utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| And another advantage of bringing that extension in and that park drive in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| is that it allows for school buses to make their way back out of South Doyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| without putting additional stress and pressure on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| What we've heard in our stakeholder workshops and our neighborhood roundtables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| pretty much in everything where we had a presence from the South Haven group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| is that their neighborhood is pressured by cars trying to access the great facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| and playgrounds and all that at Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| So we think it's really important that we think about these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| and try to provide ways that people can access the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| without adding extra pressure on the neighborhood itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| So as we come on through, again, the nodal parking distributes around down existing Tilson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| until it gets to the intersection of Lancaster and Decatur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| And you can see the greenway crossing that we're proposing at this edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| which aligns with recommendations also from the Baker Creek Area Vision Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| that the Community Design Center has been working on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| And I think some of that work along Lancaster is being staked out right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| as part of a sidewalk program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| So as we look at how that circulation will work along the park drive down to the Tilson connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| the park drive extends, again, as two-way traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And this is a drive that the character of this is truly a park drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| So you're talking about a meandering drive that weaves through these existing groves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| of a combination of hardwoods and evergreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Bite peg greenway moves through the grove as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| And we have a two-way paved greenway and compacted dirt trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| So we have the ability to provide different types of characteristics of trails there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| but it's important that we consider universal access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| So we do have the ability to bring universal accessibility from the terminus all the way down through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| And along Tilson Street, again, we have this angular parking which accesses a new footpath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| And this will allow that nodal parking to access different areas of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| to not just pave the entirety of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| So as we bring cars here, it has the dual benefit of slowing traffic that moves down through that park drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| And as you come to the Decatur Drive-South Doyle connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| improvements at that bridge are proposed to allow us to provide better vehicular access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| into those 200-and-something spaces at South Doyle Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| while also improving the sidewalk and bike path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| providing a safer connection for the students of South Doyle Middle School to walk into their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| So looking specifically at the terminus and some of the design of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| we thought that it was important to really not look away from the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| that this is a big piece of repurposed urban infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| So we want to enhance the fact that it is a piece of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| and that character comes into some of the design things that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| But we also are conscious of the fact that the character south of Sevierville Pike is totally different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| So the dichotomy of those two things is something that we think we can really take advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| and create a unique space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| So we're going to do that through repurposing the existing highway infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| So we have the overpass here, which provides this great covered space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| So we think we can maximize, I guess, the value of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| and make that a unique experience in itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| and really amplify the fact that you're in this transition moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| between parkway infrastructure into the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| And then we think it's important to create this destination for play and gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| so that we provide opportunities for people to stop at the terminus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| and want to stay there and spend time at that spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| and not move directly down to Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| So how this looks as a part of Phase 1, this is all Phase 1 rendering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| So you see the existing roadway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| So we just are striping the asphalt and just doing minor changes within this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| to provide that access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| So if you come in and find parking here or don't find parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| you have the opportunity to come back around until you find parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| or to turn right and enter that parkway drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| and move on through to this parking that you see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| which is the south to a middle parking, or on through some of the nodal parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| So looking at the plan of that, some of the things that are happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| we're adding 65 spaces at the terminus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| We're also proposing amenities including a kids' bike circuit and a ride center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| and some of the things that are associated with the great biking facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| that we already have there and just really trying to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| And you can see also with the orange representing that connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| up and over to the Cottrell Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| So if you're coming from Anita and you come on through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| and access the system in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| So with an overhead view, you can get a better idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| of the kids' bike circuit that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| So the idea of the kids' bike circuit is that we have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| that can give children or adults with limited biking experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| an opportunity to experience different types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| that they might find within the trails of the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| So it's really a training opportunity for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| because you can get kind of scared to access that if you're like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| and don't bike very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| It can be a scary spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Also, some of the swings and things that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| attach to the existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| So this is a multi-generational play space too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| These are just swings for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| So there's something for everyone to do, all supported by a ride center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| which is adjacent to the Woodland Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| So this is where the transition happens over to the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| and then also a scramble and slide area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| So more play features for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Yeah, it is important to emphasize part of what the team has proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| and much of the feedback we have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| is that we need uses for all ages and all abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| You know, much of our downhill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and single track mountain biking facilities are incredible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| but not all users can access those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| And so if you'll notice in each of these spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| we've been very intentional in making sure we've got lots of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| for lots of abilities and ages from very, very young to a more senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| to all abilities, and so you're going to see that throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| So a view looking from the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| And the Woodland Plaza here with, again, the kind of soft plaza surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| that transitions into that woodland south of Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| And this is the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| I'll talk about the programming of that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| So moving on down to the Tilson Connector and Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| this is that extension of that park drive on through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| to provide that access both in and out of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| to limit pressure in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Then the Greenway, that extends on through as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| So again, some of the survey information that comes from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| It was informed conceptually during the conceptual phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| by boots on the ground surveys from people like Casey Krause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| the urban forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Also, Equinox on the design team identified areas of wetlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and some of those important tree groves and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| But once we get, which we get this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| the field survey information with locations of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| this will be adjusted to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| So, again, the Tilson Connector and Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| with the two-way traffic through the woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| So this is those existing groves of trees that we're weaving through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| And on down to the Tilson Street and Play Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| So the Play Forest features that you see here are the ones that you see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| So we're just trying to enhance and support those existing amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| that are so wonderful there and provide nodal parking as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| so you can provide access to those spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| And to make those spaces accessible, fully accessible for all users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Right, and so with the extension of the Greenway as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| so we have that universal access through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| And then moving down to Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| This is the existing conditions of how it looks today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| So the agenda within that space is really to just enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| and organize those great features, those great amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| that we already have within that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| So there's a reason there's so much activity within that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| So we just want to make sure that we can enhance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| and really preserve the existing natural features that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| and create what we feel like will be an appropriate entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| into the trails and amenities that we've worked so hard as a community to establish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| So we're going to do that by providing more formal parking opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| at Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Right now people just kind of park wherever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Some of it's on city property, some of it's on Baker Creek Bottoms property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| So we need to really provide a clear distinction between that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| And we want to do that in a way that does not reduce the amount of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| that exists at that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| So we have some parking that's proposed within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| We also want to create space for events and gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and continue that theme of universal accessibility through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| So we have accessible paths and loops for all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| That's something we don't have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| We have a view from overhead showing the open lawn and the play area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| The proposal here is the current play area sits here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| So we're going to reorganize where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| What it looks like is the property ownership of Baker Creek Bottoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| kind of oozes over this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| So a lot of cars park through here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| So we need to provide that clear delineation between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| and take that parking that was here and move that to another space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| So we move that down to the flat area closer to Taylor Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| And when we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| it gives us the opportunity to then create a larger sloped lawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| so a larger, more functional space for events and gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| And also we can take some of those great elements of the adventure playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and relocate them into that sloped bank on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| where there are existing trees and things to provide shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| And then, again, the connection across Taylor or Lancaster right there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| is something, again, that coincides with the design center's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| So moving through, looking at the section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| so we do have some slope that happens from up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| which is where the Baker Creek Bottoms property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| so parking at Baker Creek Bottoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Then moving on down through where Baker Creek is onto Taylor Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| so you can get an idea of the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| And a view now working down from Baker Creek Bottoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| looking down over that open lawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| where we have a new structure proposed at the base of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| and that structure providing shade, providing bathrooms and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| And the approach, again, as you come across Taylor or Lancaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| past that building and into the trails of Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| And some of the enhanced and additional play features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| that we might add within that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| will allow parents who have children of different ages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| to have kids that are occupied doing different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| And for those parents, we have shade structures and things that we don't have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| And the last part is just about the programming, the pavilions themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| So we have two pavilions that are proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| We have a pavilion at the terminus and a pavilion at Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| And the pavilions are similar, but there are some differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| The terminus pavilion would function primarily as a ride center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| whereas the one at Baker Creek Preserve is more of a picnic and shade pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| I think there are elements and components of both of those things that happen at both spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| But also both of those buildings have a comfort station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| so we're going to have bathrooms there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| We're going to have outdoor places to wash off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| And then the buildings also have kind of integrated wayfinding and orientation elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| And obviously these are just examples of durable, functional buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| I think part of the feedback was these are public spaces that we're going to have to maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| so they need to be functional, but they need to be durable and they need to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| And so the design of those will come later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| but I think the team wanted to give a flavor of what the concepts could flesh out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| So looking more specifically at the building program at the terminus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| 4,400 square feet, including the ride center, comfort station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| and then orientation and wayfinding elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| So this is really the moment where you understand that you're entering the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| You figure out where you want to go, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| And then two, I guess four, toilet facilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| So again, the structure of that, which we're developing further as we go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| but again, this is a building that kind of weaves underneath the structure of the Sevierville Pike Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| right here with the comfort station at the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| And as we move over to Baker Creek Preserve, then the building is a little bit smaller at that edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| It has two bathrooms instead of four, two toilets instead of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| There is still orientation and wayfinding that's more specifically related to Baker Creek Preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| whereas the urban wilderness gateway park wayfinding would be a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| So see how that anchors the open lawn and provides this kind of transition moment between the open plaza space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2125)|
| 0:35:33| which open plaza space is envisioned as something that can be multifunctional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| So when you have different festivals or events down at Baker Creek Preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| this could turn into an open event space, flat area for things like tents and all that are associated with trail days and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2143)|
| 0:35:53| And see the same kind of language just morphs itself around the shape of what's happening at Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| So an approach from where the open lawn is with a comfort station kind of wrapped in the skin and then from the backside as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| So this is moving through that plaza space with the open lawn behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| And with that, that is where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Council, this is quite a bit of information to try to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| But what we're primarily talking about is the end phase beyond Sevier Avenue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| Yeah, the $10 million is the transition at Sevier, Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and the connection over to Baker Creek Bottoms and the private development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| And so the $10 million is focused on actual construction of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| I think the future framework, though, is really important to establish now of what could be in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| which is essentially taking an overbuilt controlled access interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| and transitioning part of it to a two-mile linear park connecting downtown, the museum, future museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| Morningside, across the river for all users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| It could be cars, it could be bicyclists, walkers, anything, wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| And so we wanted to show the future, and I think we've started to chart that path with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| They've conveyed, I say the dead end, they've conveyed that undeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| They're working with us on the transition piece, and then we're working on two other agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| some type of an agreement or conveyance of the actual lanes on James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| Again, that's future, require additional engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And then we've got to get across the bridge, and so an agreement to get across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| And so this would be a phased project, but the $10 million is focused on really the bulk of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| I do want to bring up part of the feedback we did here, and I feel like we've, when I say we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| the team and Rebecca Jane and others and the Urban Wonderness Alliance has done a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| trying to make sure that the impacts on the neighborhood are a real benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| And we know that traffic from the school is a challenge, and so we want to try to address that at some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| Much of what we heard was how can we get people to use brown airs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| and if you can get to a slide that shows brown airs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| We took that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| We actually have studied brown airs, and I'll show you where it is on an overhead here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| We've studied brown airs, and I've actually sent an email to meet with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| We've got the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| What could the alignments be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| There's brown airs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| So you're going to have the new BMX, and you've got the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| From the neighborhood's perspective, and there are several folks here, and they can correct me if I say this wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| they would love to have that cut-through traffic to exit the school directly on brown airs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| and so we're working with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| I've got a call in to Jim Snowden with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| We've done the preliminary alignment and estimating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| and so that brown airs is going to be an important piece that I believe we'll have to collaborate with the county on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| to truly address the cut-through traffic and the added traffic once BMX is up and running, the county's BMX project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| So county school traffic, county BMX project, which is a huge amenity as well for this entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| but we've got to deal with the cut-through, and we've tried to address it at some level in our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| I hope neighborhoods feel comfortable with that, and then we also are going to work with the county on the brown airs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| I did want to recognize Carson Daly, who is the county commissioner in that area, so thank you for being here, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| Did you have something else on brown airs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| I'm sorry, Brandon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Yeah, I was just going to add that the issue that we've got is a lot of buses come down to Cater right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| and to Cater does not have any capacity to support that, and so buses go through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| People trying to access the urban wilderness come through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| children who are walking that don't get bused to school that live in the neighborhood here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| so there's a lot of conflict that happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| So we feel like if we can provide an opportunity for cars to stay out of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| and for buses to leave in a different way and turn left at that spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| then we're making it safer and we're limiting that pressure within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| And I failed to mention this on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| The city, through its community development agreement with the East Tennessee Community Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| Mr. Greve is here, actually funded a very specific study for the South Haven community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| I know Ms. Rust is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| And so our study and the South Haven, that feedback has been incredibly beneficial to our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| to see what the concerns are and see where these projects can marry each other up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| and try to address connectivity and cut through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| And so Linda's here if there's any questions on that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| We've got a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I suspect some of my colleagues may have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| I'll just go back to the road to where it is now and how that's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| So I'm headed south on James White Parkway and I get off that exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| Is it going to still look like an exit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| And then how's the road going straight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Am I going to be able to go straight right through that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| I'll just go through that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| I didn't quite get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| I didn't get it when I saw the model out there back in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| So I wasn't quite clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I'll zoom in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| So the gray road, that's existing southbound traffic on James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| So this is what you do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| So right now the barriers exist here that keep you from going this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| So there will be changes that happen within this area that will direct you into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| It could be just striping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| We're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| We're not in detailed design right now, but those will be things that we start to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| Specifically, how do you make the transition into this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| But what it's not is it's not the extension of this road on through this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| I mean, you come in and you access a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| So you'll have signage and wayfinding elements and components that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| So you'll turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I'm going 55 miles an hour, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Well, really quick, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| A significant part of this phase one is an engineering problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| And so we've got Gresham Smith and we have Vaughn and Melton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| And that's really going to be a task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| How do you transition from a controlled access 55-mile-an-hour essentially interstate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| And so they're going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| That's really the next level is design development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| What does that transition look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| And I think what you're going to see is a transition now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| And then in the future, if we end up funding and working with the county on brown airs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| it could be even some additional changes to that off-ramp where we would want to line up brown airs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| as best we could with that interchange there and try to have a single signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| And so, again, I think you'll see, again, this will be phased over several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| but this phase one is going to be one design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And then in the future it may be tweaked additionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| And there's more work to be done to get to that future long-term vision framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| that was laid out by the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| There's more engineering work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| But our preliminary discussions with TDOT, we presented a similar design to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| as they're positive about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| And we've proven it with the numbers through our traffic engineering folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| But switching over to just north, I guess switching off just to the southbound lanes, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| moving all four, now you have four lanes on the southbound side, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| No, none on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Will that start, will that be in this first project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| No, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| That's a very expensive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| There would be significantly more public process, design work, engineering work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| That's just your concept at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Yeah, I think what we want to show is what can be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| And then we're going to start on one end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| and we're going to continue to work towards this connectivity with Morningside and downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Sorry, I was going to say it's important that we go through this effort conceptually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| so that we can make a case, make an argument to TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| If you go to TDOT and you say, can I have half of this road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Then their answer is going to be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| But if you say, can I have half of this road because this is what we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| and here's the information, the traffic studies that we've got to back that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| which prove that the capacity can be handled with two lanes for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| for the next 25-plus years, then that becomes a compelling case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| And that's something that they've had the ability to negotiate with TDOT now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| and get more from TDOT than what was originally anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| I'll answer also your question about the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| This is James White Parkway as it transitions to two-way traffic both ways in the southbound lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| So as you come through, once that traffic moves over, that becomes a city street south of Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| When it becomes a city street, it's got a city speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| It's going to feel like a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| It's not going to feel like an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| The character of that road is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| So as you come to the spot right here at that intersection, you would literally turn left there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| or you would continue on to the off-ramp up to Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| So this becomes an important intersection as a part of a future phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| I think Mr. Brace mentioned the word wheelchair at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| and I was wanting to know about folks with various ability levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| We talked about ability, and I think what we were really talking about was skill level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| with regard to how well you can bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| I think it's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| I think it's skill level on a bicycle, but it's also an individual that has a disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| that wants to take their child down to the place structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Right now, the parking for those is challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Much of the access points are an aggregate that, when fully compacted and maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| would probably pass the spirit of ADA, but from a practical perspective, it needs to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| And so we want these spaces to be used not only by single-track mountain bikers and hikers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| but a grandmother, someone who is down from out of town and has a health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| They can come into these spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| They can enjoy these spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| They can walk right over from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| So we want to provide recreational opportunities for all phases of life from birth to, well, towards the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| So that's really the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| Where we're all hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Very, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| The other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Cradle to grave, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| The other question is, in looking at this really fantastic space that we have in the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2799)|
| 0:46:48| what other, is there anything that we can look at, you know, in neighboring communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| or anywhere nearby where we can get a sense of, you know, what they've done with that kind of a space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| To me, this seems pretty unique, and I don't know if you can address that for us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| Well, I would say that, well, let me address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Taking a controlled access, I'll say interstate, and transitioning it to the future phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| that is fairly unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| That doesn't happen often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| But the opportunity has arisen because of the status of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| So the opportunity is before us, and I think if we miss it, it would be a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| So that is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Now, fortunately, we have this great partnership with Legacy Parks, with Appalachian Mountain Bike Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| with Iams, Aslan Foundation, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| So we can bring these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| The Appalachian Mountain Bike Club traveled down to Arkansas and has gone to Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| and they've gone up to the, Rebecca Jane went up on a trip, I think, up to Vermont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| So how do we take these best practices for that type of use and bring them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| Obviously, Legacy Parks has incredible wealth of knowledge on these park spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| And so I think what we want to do is unique, but it really is authentic to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| You know, why do people go to Asheville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| It's because it's Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| You know, this is one of those things that people are going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| I want to go to Knoxville because, man, that's Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| It's biking. It's hiking. It's riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| It's these great spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| It's a museum. It's downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| So it's unique, but I think the success of this is really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| I'm going to push it over to Port and the designers on this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| We've got a fabulous design team that has really looked beyond the traditional park space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| And I'll let Brandon talk more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Yeah, and I can give a couple of specific examples that have been finished in the last decade or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| These are examples of repurposed infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| So one of them would be the High Line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| and this is a train line that you're probably all familiar with in Manhattan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| that was an underutilized, not utilized at all, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| piece of existing infrastructure that that community turned into something that's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| And so what's happened with the High Line is you have all kinds of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| through meatpacking, through Chelsea, up the west side of Manhattan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| that's associated with that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| So it's an economic driver, what happens with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| The other example would be the Beltline in Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| where you see all the development that's happened around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| and that's development that's kind of on the back of this type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| which is bike, ped, multi-use spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| And so what we have right now within the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| we have great spaces for mountain biking, great spaces for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| But what it's not yet, and what I think this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| the big opportunity of this project is what it can become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| which is something that has more benefit to a greater number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| and be an asset to the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| So it is people, universal access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| It is people of all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| It is economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| It's not just about mountain biking and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| So I think we've got an opportunity here that is truly unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| One thing as well that you will not see in this is the design does not show a concession stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| that the city is going to run or the county is going to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| We want to provide the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| And then folks, I mean, Mr. Wise is here from Baker Creek Bottoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| We want the market to then provide all those amenities that people are going to want to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| They're going to want to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| They're going to need to rent a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| They're going to want to get a helmet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| They may want to stay the night somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| And so we want to provide this infrastructure for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| And then when visitors come, we want the market where it's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| along these commercial corridors, along Sevier, and they're at Lancaster, near Sono Taco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| and then obviously Baker Creek Bottoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| We want the market to actually develop and serve the needs of people that not only live here and use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| but also come in town and use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Ms. Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| So I just had a few comments I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| I think I've sat through how many of these presentations, Rebecca and Jane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And I learn something new every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| You guys do such a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| So I have really appreciated the process that the city has gone through to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| There are a few things that I just wanted to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| First of all, just around community process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| and I think hopefully I'm not out of line in saying I did have some concerns early on about community process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| and you were so responsive, Rebecca, Jane, David, Brandon, Sean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| have showed up at multiple community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| and pulled together different stakeholder groups that have really important interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| that aren't always in exact alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| So that can be really challenging to sort of go through the appropriate process to pull all of that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| and I've watched the design evolve as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| So I'm just really grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| It's possible that not everybody's concerns have been precisely addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| but I think that what I see in the point that we're at now is that concerns have been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| and have been incorporated into the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| The other thing that I appreciate about this, and hopefully council can see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| is the big picture that sort of pulling back and taking a big picture perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| which I'm really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| I think it also helped our neighborhood groups feel even more excited about the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| because it became more than just about a park at the end of James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| but it's how we're connecting South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| which has been a part of the community that really hasn't been connected to the rest of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| It's connecting us to the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| So I also think that big picture is potentially going to save us money in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| So we're not going to have to go back, and I know, David, you talked a little bit about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| yeah, we might have to make some changes, but you already know about that ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| because we're looking at this big picture in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So I've really appreciated that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| And then the last thing I want to note is that the phasing of the projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| and this gets back to input from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| I heard a lot of concerns about infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| and how important it would be to make sure that we have the appropriate infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| to support neighborhoods before adding programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| that would just put additional pressure on neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| And so I don't know, Brandon, that you mentioned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| but the first phase will actually happen, my understanding is, in two phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| with the emphasis being on doing the infrastructure first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| so that we can address some of those neighborhood concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| and then build the programming once that infrastructure is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| so that it can be accommodated more appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| And then the last thing I want to note is thank you for the sidewalk on Lancaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| I was over at Sono Taco today, and I had five people come up to me during lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| and say, oh, the surveys were out here, and they're starting to get some measurements for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| So that sidewalk piece is a huge win, I think, also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| and I'm looking at Linda Rust back there and thank her for all of her convening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| of the Baker Creek Small Area Plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| So sorry I took up a lot of time there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| but I just wanted to note some of those things that have been notable to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| as we've gone through this process. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you. And sidewalk reminded me that I did not introduce Sean Fitzpatrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| Sean, if you'll raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Sean is a longtime city engineer, south Knoxville resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| and manages most of those infrastructure projects that obviously people love, like sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| Sorry, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Thank you, Ms. Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Are there other comments or questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| I just wanted to clarify, and I think Stephanie kind of touched on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| We're looking at this big picture here that you've presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| It's hard to know what's phase one, phase two at this point and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| Talking about what Stephanie touched on of focusing on the programming later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| and getting some of that traffic dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| what is the time frame and what phase are we looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| and what's the urgency that it needs to happen in for the parking that now happens at Baker Creek Bottoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| because it happens, to get that routed towards South Doyle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Is that something that's phase one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Is that in this initial expenditure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| And it is a little confusing because you have phases and then you have phases and phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| So there's phase one and phase two and then there's phase A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| I don't know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Phase A and phase B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| And so what we're trying to do is separate phase one into two bid packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| and that allows us to move a little bit quicker to isolate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| to separate the infrastructural components from the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| get that designed, go into construction documents while we're developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| going through the design development phase and construction document phase in phase A of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| So phase B of phase one would be the pretty stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| It would be planting, it would be the amenities, it would be all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| We want to make sure that phase A, the infrastructure, happens first, and we have that stuff set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| And there are two reasons for that, and one is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| to be able to kind of peel off and separate the project so it's not this kind of big, huge, cumbersome project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| The other reason is because we feel like that we can identify different types of contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| for the different types of elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| So with city projects, city engineering projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| they're typically bid by roadway contractors who are really good at infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| they're really good at roads, they're not so good at the pretty stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| the stuff that we're going to have in a separate bid package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| So that separate bid package of the pretty stuff will allow us to have the types of contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| that may not have a roadway certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| but that would be able to execute landscaping, buildings, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| basically more cheaply is what we hope than a road contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| They do a good job of it, it's just a little more expensive often times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| They do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Yeah, so we break out the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| then we break out the programming and the landscape architect type phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| But the $10 million is the transition at the dead end all the way back to Baker Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| connectivity into the schools, and those amenities really that we focused on, on 70% of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| Some of those people who would bid on the Phase B, they could be a prime for that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| and they would have to be a subcontractor on the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| So that's where the value really comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| It's not that one's more expensive than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| So tapping into that shared parking with South Doyle Middle is part of Phase I, Part A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| That's a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Yeah, it's a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Connecting to that, wayfinding to that is a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| The school system has been incredible to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| and there will be things we need to look at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| Some of those lots may need to be paved, and if there is a city use of those lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| we're going to have to work through that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| But I will say that the principal at South Doyle Middle School has been fabulous in the team there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| But it's a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| And what is the timeframe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| I guess 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| It's hard to see, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Yeah, this says Phase I ribbon cutting, which really what our target is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| is to have the ribbon cutting on the infrastructure improvements within the area before the end of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3510)|
| 0:58:40| So one more question on the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Maybe the existing council and mayor will help do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| So the infrastructure, is that part of the $10 million, too, or would that be separated in another capital project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| No, it's part of the $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| It's part of the $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Yeah, $10 million is infrastructure and amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Ms. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Again, it's not a question, but I did just want to give a shout out to Debbie Sharp from the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| who has really helped, I think, advise some of the community process and is a great asset to city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| in helping with that neighborhood engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| So I didn't mention that earlier, and I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I know you gave a shout out earlier, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| She does incredible work, her and Eden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| So they've really helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| So, Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| And so, David, I just wanted to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| So the traffic engineering study as it relates to the exit and entrance, that also is part of Phase 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| So how we transition from the two-lane southbound into that park space is absolutely part of Phase 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3578)|
| 0:59:47| and those engineers, the engineers will dig into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| And so will council be provided continuous updates as we get through some of those phases and those conceptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| Yeah, I mean, right now the team is working on design development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| and they're going to move towards construction documents, and we can give you updates as you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| We'll keep you up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| We obviously, all of this is on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| We try to be incredibly transparent, like all of our public processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| So all of it is on the website under Urban Wilderness Gateway Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| There's a video, many of the design documents, and we will just continue to update that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| and then we can update you throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| I just think that part is critically important because of the safety element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| It's the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Well, thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Any other questions or concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| We do have public forum, and we only have one person signed up to speak, and that's Tom Weiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| If he's still here and would like to share some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Mr. Weiss, if you would please give us your name and your address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| Tom Weiss, 220 Staub Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Would you put up the Baker Creek Preserve conceptual drawing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3664)|
| 1:01:19| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| Show us where your property is, Mr. Weiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Well, I don't have a good way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Well, he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| He's doing it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Brandon knows where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| He's circling it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| And you will notice that, I mean, those light gray areas are asphalt, and the darker gray areas are buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3695)|
| 1:01:45| And anyway, I don't like to speak in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| I very seldom do this, but this is an important issue to me, and so I kind of organized some remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| so if you'll pardon me, I'm going to try to be organized for a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| And we talked about uniqueness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| Councilman Roberto mentioned that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Stephanie also alluded to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| I think everyone is aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I think this is a case where it would be possible to actually not see the forest for the trees in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3735)|
| 1:02:26| There is only one urban wilderness in the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| 1,000 acres of interconnected parks and easements that provide over 50 miles of hiking and biking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3751)|
| 1:02:41| and it's in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| That is the uniqueness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| No other city in the country can boast of that urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| So let's not forget about how unique that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| That is why Baker Creek Bottoms exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| That's why we have been, are currently, and will continue to be inspired by the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| and that's why I'm here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| I'm going to skip through some of the, I love words, but I'm going to skip over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| On Labor Day, I made two trips out to Baker Creek Bottoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| One, I needed to inspect a building, and two, later on in the day, I wanted to go on a hike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| So earlier in the day, on Labor Day, of course that's a holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| and you've got a better than average number of people who are going to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| I took a photograph of the parking there, and there were, at the first time that I was there and observed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3822)|
| 1:03:52| before I got into the building, there were 25 cars, plus or minus one or two maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| because some people were moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| And those cars were split pretty evenly between our property and city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| Now, we have been allowing our property to be used by the public, or essentially for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| at no charge for over a year and a half, and we're glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| We're not asking for any special citations or awards for that, but that won't continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| We are in active negotiations right now with several really fine businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| that South Knoxville is going to be really proud of, but they are going to require parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| and we're going to have to enforce that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| It's going to have to be made available only to our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| So if there's not adequate parking at that trailhead, and we can talk about parking at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| and that's wonderful, to the best of my knowledge, the mandate or the permission for that parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| is a verbal agreement with the current principle right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| Well, that's not going to be sufficient for my banker to finance Baker Creek Bottoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| So all we care about really is we don't want the city to supply us with parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| but we want the city to supply the public who are going to be visiting the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| Baker Creek Preserve, and the new park, the new gateway park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| We want to make sure that there's adequate parking for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| because if you look at this drawing, we have the only really convenient parking on pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| that is right next to the Baker Creek Preserve trailhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| And, I mean, we like that, but that's part of the reason that we're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| but we're going to have to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| We need to protect that for our customers because people are going to be paying rent for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| Currently, going back to Labor Day, when I went in to inspect the building, there were 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| When I came back out, there were 30 cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Later on in the day, there were fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| But I guess my request is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I don't know that the traffic engineers have really gotten totally engaged in this process yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| Tom, you've got about one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Okay. Well, I won't even need quite all that, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| All I'm asking is that this Phase I project provide at least as much parking as currently exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=3988)|
| 1:06:40| and the current plan does not provide for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| The gateway is probably going to stimulate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| It's probably going to increase public visitors to the urban wilderness, which is what we all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| I mean, that's why it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| So we shouldn't be reducing the parking right next to the trailhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| That's all I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| I'm sure you and Mr. Brace will talk if you haven't already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| Yeah, I figured you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Are there other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| If not, there are no other speakers signed up for public forum, and we will adjourn this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180906?start=4043)|
