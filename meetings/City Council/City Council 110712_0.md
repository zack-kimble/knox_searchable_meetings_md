| 0:12:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Are there any other reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Yeah, thank you Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| I just wanted to mention that we have a, the Joint Commission Council now has a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| to meet on the Ridgetop Slope hillside development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| And Steve Joyner with the Lipscomb University has agreed to be the facilitator at a reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| And Cornerstone of Knoxville has agreed to underwrite the cost of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| So Lawrence Tullock and those folks have stepped up to take care of the costs incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| So the first meeting is going to be on the 21st of July, and we will meet every two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| weeks thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Also today was the first meeting of the Pension Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| It began today at 4 o'clock, and they had an organizational meeting, and they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| to meet every third Thursday going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| So really excited about them convening on this critical issue, and so I'll give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| council updates as we move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| And today Mayor, we had a really a joint effort, ribbon cutting, with our energy solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| company Amoresco, our golf course manager Billy Casper, and the city coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| under Steve King and Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| We cut the ribbon for the new lake at the city Whittle Springs Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| So that's going to save us about $20,000 a year in water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Unfortunately, we're not going to buy that much water from KUB anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| We're going to pump it from the Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| So not only are we going to save money, but we're going to have a better quality of golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| course there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=837)|

| 0:15:50| cutoff you have in the paper as well as, I know you're doing the mail outs, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=950)|

| 0:16:19| I kind of like your suggestion about a press release might be the way to go about it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| obviously we have to spend money on notices and we do those consistent with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| And certainly if we are required to do a notice, you have my assurance that we will do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| but I will look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| I was saying it's a courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1002)|

| 0:17:53| Mayor, I know you were the one who filled out the application, but I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| say that this has gone through the Public Property Naming Committee and was passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| And we look forward to a date in the future where council and the public will be invited for some type of ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| Yes, we will be working with Joe Walsh on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| And we're trying to find a time when his family, I think they're going to be here for a family reunion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| So we're going to be working on that, and we'll let everybody know when that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| I think it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1109)|

| 0:19:26| So put that on your calendar and come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1168)|

| 0:19:54| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Yes, I just wanted to comment a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Part of this, of course, being in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| I really like this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| And I've looked at the proposals as far as the road connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| I think there's a tremendous opportunity here to relieve us of some urban blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| and also to turn that property back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| And that area around there, I think, would be ripe for a business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Also, I like the part, of course, that you might be able to put in a greenway consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| You know, I think the development of the property is the cake, but the greenway would be the icing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| But I just really wanted to applaud you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| It all looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1232)|

| 0:20:36| Councilman Dale Volkert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| He's making me hungry with this cake and icing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I'll second his suggestion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Had one, because I think it is a great thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| and I think it's good that we're using the brownfields and encouraging development in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Looking at page 16, there's a section called Items Not Included in the Current Scope of Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| And I was just curious, Steve, why, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| as-built plans are not going to be done by this design organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Is that something that you don't normally have to turn in to the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Will that be a separate contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| We're not required to do that by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Which is not within the scope at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| We will, as we build the project, we will make notes on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| So we will, in effect, our inspectors will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| You'll have a marked set, in essence, in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Well, that explains that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Councilman, what page were you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| I was on page 16, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| of the letter to Tom Clabo from the company that was describing its services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| And there were several items that weren't included, things like traffic signals and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| But I thought since this was a design firm, they would do the final plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1311)|

| 0:23:20| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Yeah, I'd just like to say, I mean, this is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| and obviously you all are probably getting tired of hearing me talk about bicycle trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| but get used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I think it's something that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| I remember when we started the greenway systems back when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| and who would have ever thought that we could have moved it as far as we've moved it in this few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| And I think, you know, 15 or 20 years from now, you know, the work that we're doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| the smart planning that we're doing, just what we voted on with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| going to the I-275 business park, you know, making the greenways now instead of later is an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| It's smart planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| It's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| And, you know, we can really make this a bicycle-friendly city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| hopefully the most bicycle-friendly city in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| And I want to tell you all, all the district members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| that I've challenged my district to become the most bicycle-friendly district in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| by offering bike racks and what have you outside of their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Let's open up our business, you know, make sure that people know that we've got something special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1457)|

| 0:24:27| So I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| It's something that's going to really move, you know, my district forward, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| You've heard my plan, but I think it's something that's very positive for the city and the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| So I'm just really excited about this measure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| And it's close to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1482)|

| 0:24:47| Thank you for that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| That's going to help with the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| It's going to help with obesity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1490)|

| 0:26:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| I guess I want to ask a brief question to Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| I know the explanation tells us that we had an experience over the years that has several events that have raised our out-of-pocket retained, I guess, obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1598)|
| 0:26:51| Does that explain, in your mind, the $96,000 increase in price from the last time we had this contract, just the actual rateable experience went up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1611)|
| 0:27:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| In the AIS, Councilmember Della Volpe, we did try to explain some of the background to why both the deductible, they use a different term, but that part of it as well as the premium went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1623)|
| 0:27:18| You're talking about the retention, the $2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| The retention, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| It was caused by some rather large events, if you will, that we had happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| Overall, our workers' comp trends are improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| They need to be better, but they are getting there at least on a more positive trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| We've got to continue to emphasize safety among our employees and in their daily work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| But in this case, we're also not happy with both of those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| We're not happy with how this particular policy was marketed, and we're going to look at a change relative to the firm we used to market this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1675)|
| 0:28:07| And if you remember, at the last Council meeting, we had some discussion about the items we had on the agenda then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| and we talked about how we aggressively marketed those, risk management working with Willis in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| And we hope to take the same approach here because we think our trends are improving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| but there were these couple of events that sort of dominate this story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| So with a little safety and some luck, we should be able to reduce these premiums going forward, hopefully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| Well, that would be our hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| There's certainly no guarantee to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| We're going to have to get some time distance from those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| Hopefully the more aggressive marketing of the coverage will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| And then our continued emphasis just on safety within the city is an important element of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1732)|

| 0:33:03| I'm Michael Covington, 2566 Brooks Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about my 6th District Councilman, Daniel Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| I first met Daniel Brown in this very chamber in March of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| Prior to this impromptu meeting, and unbeknownst to him, I had vigorously campaigned for him to fill the seat vacated by former Vice Mayor Mark Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| who has moved on to a position as Judicial Commissioner for Knox County, and Mark's immediate successor, Robert Booker, who completed the Brown Council term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2009)|
| 0:33:39| It was clear to me from the roster of candidates vying for the 6th District seat in 2009 that Daniel Brown was the man for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2019)|
| 0:33:48| Truth be told, when I came to understand that Dan Brown was a retired postal worker, that was enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| Some years ago, I worked closely with the United States Postal Service as a consultant and postal operations manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| for the company responsible for the assortment of seasonal greeting cards that we all receive in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| They have cute little chickadees, kittens, puppies, and in some cases, even polar bears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| I got one in the mail today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| These cards are mailed to solicit contributions for a whole host of nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| My favorite design was always the polar bears, in part because one particular design was a fixture on Jerry Seinfeld's refrigerator for a few seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| You can notice that design in numerous reruns of the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| The Bad Boys of the Arctic was the description for that high-volume card run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| And like any high-volume operation, when things are going good, things are really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| But when things go bad, they go really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Having been responsible for mailing over a half billion with a B mail pieces during my tenure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| one memorable summer when temperatures hovered around 98 degrees for much of the season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| the Bad Boys of the Arctic became a nightmare all over the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| as temperatures in hundreds of mail trailers rose above 130 degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| causing our precious cargo to come unglued on processing floors in bulk mail centers and mailing units from coast to coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| Dan Brown likely had to deal with some of that carnage when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| Once the first formal complaint was lodged via interpostal messaging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| a torrent of complaints flooded in from around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| and postal management at L'Enfant Plaza headquarters in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| prepared to issue a formal refusal to accept millions of dollars worth of mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| thereby jeopardizing untold millions in contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Having established a good working relationship with actual mailers in the bulk mail centers in Capitol Heights, Maryland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| and around the country, I understood who really made the mail move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| and who could give me enough information to craft a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| After a brief conversation with one of Dan Brown's counterparts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I decided my only hope to save the company was to buy back every piece of defective mail at a modest price per pound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| At the time, it was considered a magnanimous gesture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| In actuality, the move not only prevented refusal of our 3602 mail deposits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| but also led to a measure of vindication for the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Turned out the suggestion of Dan Brown's associate was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| As the first load of tattered mail pieces arrived at our warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| it was apparent that there were dozens of other mailers whose mail had come apart in the mail stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| causing the disruption that we alone had been accused of causing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| Upon presentation of this evidence, we received an apology from the Postal Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| and I received a personal commendation from then Postmaster General William J. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Absent the assistance of a person like Daniel Brown, who was willing to take a moment to simply share a little history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| I would never have been able to effect a solution to save the day, save the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| and sustain a mailing operation that today mails seasonal cards for an expanding roster of organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| including the University of Tennessee Alumni Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Having decided in 2009 that retired postal worker Dan Brown was the ideal candidate to represent District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| I set out to help him win the election by encouraging voters in the district to cast their vote confidently for Daniel T. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| As I explained to Nick Pavlis at one of his 2009 meet and greets, politics is a contact sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| On Election Day, Dan Brown prevailed, and since taking office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| he has done nothing but make us proud of how he has rolled up his sleeves and gone to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| My faith and confidence in him has been rewarded by the fine job he is doing as a leader and example for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| Thank you, Dan Brown, for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| As a way of saying thank you for the work he has done in District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| not to mention distinguishing himself among his colleagues to become mayor of this fair city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| the Daniel T. Brown Invitational Golf Tournament has been established to honor Mayor and Councilman Brown for his service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| The tournament, hosted by the Williams Creek Golf Course, which is in the mayor's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| will benefit youth golfers committed to maximizing their golf potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| The inaugural event is scheduled for August 6 at the course, which is located at 2351 Dandridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| A brief putting contest will precede the 9 a.m. shotgun start with an awards luncheon following the completion of the tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| A few of you have tentatively committed to play, while others have expressed an interest in participating in the awards luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| I would welcome council members to both play and or attend the awards luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| and those arrangements can be made through the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| The local business community has been very helpful in assisting the effort with an assortment of sponsorships, door prizes, and goodie bag items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| and we anticipate even greater participation in the coming weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| I am modeling one of the gift items donated by First Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Mr. Covington, thank you very much for these very fine comments, but your time has run out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2341)|
| 0:39:11| Pretty much at the end, I just wanted to let Knoxville area golfers know that we welcome them at this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you for those very fine comments, and I'll let people know they were unsolicited by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| What time does the tournament start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Registration is at 8, but the actual shotgun will start right around 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110712?start=2375)|
