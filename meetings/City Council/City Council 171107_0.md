| 0:02:35| Okay, the consent items are 12X through...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| I don't have one to add by motion, but I want to make a motion to move item 12W, to move it up, that it would be close to 12E under ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=159)|
| 0:02:56| So the motion is to move 12W, which is the ordinance, which is the H1 overlay ordinance for Park Ridge, to move that up to 12...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=176)|
| 0:03:09| Just below 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Just below 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Which is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Which is 12E is an ordinance to basically amend the historic design guidelines for the existing district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=196)|

| 0:03:55| Councilman Wallace? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Okay, it does pass 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| So we will move 12W up after 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| Okay, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| We're now on the consent items 12X through 12Y or 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| Move for approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Any opposed? The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Before I start the Mayor's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| I do want to get Council's advice on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| We've got for the H1 overlay, which we just moved up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| we have nine people have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| It shows, and I think it's clear, the for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Sometimes it's confusing on for and against, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| So we have three that are signed up for, for the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| to speak for the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Six have signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| You say we have three for and six against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| I would recommend that the six that are against get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| and have just three so that we stay with our regular order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| And that is typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Those are Council's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| So unless there's any desire to change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| then let me, I want to tell you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| and if you're here, raise your hand to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| and ask that these six people might just step right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| It'll be a while before we get there to your item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| Step out and see if you can agree on three people of the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| to actually present your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| If you can't agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| then I'm just going to go from the top down, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| As it's signed up on this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| But the way the names are here are Brandy Slaybaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Slaybaugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Where's Brandy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| She called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Wade Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Here, okay, Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Stand up so people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| stand up and folks can see who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Come on, call Dr. Sally Serafin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| Sally Serafin here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Also, Alden, I can't read your writing, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| Larrick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| Alden Larrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Jimmy Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| And Rebecca Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Okay, if you all would just meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| and see if you can agree to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And if so, if you would let Eric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| raise your hand, Eric, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| See, Eric Vreeland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| if you would let Eric know who those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| and he can get them over to me, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Also, on 12F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| which is the short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| we have three people signed up for the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| and we have four signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| This is often not as clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| but it seems like since there's three and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| that it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| So, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Well, I think to keep the motion going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| that we have the four pick three to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| so that we've got the three and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Okay, so in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| the four who have signed up against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| if you would please stand up when I call your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| so you see each other and then get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| and figure out which three of you will speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| It's Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Where's Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| There, hi, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Sandy Gillespie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Phil Nordstrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| and Anne McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Is Anne here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Oh, Anne, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| If you guys would get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| and pick three of your speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| who are against the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| So now, we will move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| on the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| So, as I mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| and I've talked about all year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| is that the City Council elections are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| This is election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| And, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| if you're in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| or you're watching from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| and you haven't voted yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| you still have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| You have a little less than two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| The polls close at eight o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| So, this is your last chance to go vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| in this really important City Council election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Depending on the length of tonight's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=499)|

| 0:08:27| to the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=507)|

| 0:11:06| Okay, finally, I want to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| some city staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| who have been singled out for their great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| For many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| our uniformed departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| our police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| have done a really great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| with their Employee of the Year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| and their Employee of the Quarter programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| But most of our non-uniformed departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| did not have anything similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| So our City Ambassadors Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| which is an internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| employee engagement program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| that's headed up by Chip Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| who's our Deputy Chief of Operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| they came up with a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Employee of the Year award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| for all of these other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| The way it works is each department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| or group of departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| nominated one employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| for the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Then a review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| for the Ambassadors Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| reviews the nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| and makes an overall award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So we have here with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| and we recognized these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| at our Employee Benefits Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| but we wanted to bring them here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| before Council and before the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| to recognize them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| So with us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| we have most of the nominees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| I think all but one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| if you would please come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| and let us see you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| and recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| So first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| I'm going to list all of the nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| and the last nominee I'll announce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| and that is the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Employee of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=755)|

| 0:14:25| forestry division and he is one of those guys with the chainsaws who goes out after a storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| and gets up in the branches and clears out all the debris. He helps make sure our roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| are clear and our homes are safe. He does a lot of different work and I'm going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| him in a minute if he wants to add to that. So I want to congratulate you, Randy, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| all the nominees. I know how hard all of you work to provide great service to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| of Knoxville. Would you like to say something, Randall? Just want to thank you all for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| you do for us. He plants new trees. Plants new trees? What else do you do? We also help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| in the planting as well. Very good. Well, we thank you. You know, our urban tree canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| continues to be healthier and it continues to grow because of this urban forestry division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| We appreciate what you and all your fellow workers do and all of you as our recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| employees this year. Thank you again. I also want to again thank Chip Baird and I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=918)|
| 0:15:27| want to thank Russ Jensen for their work with the ambassadors and for organizing this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| So council, that's the end of my report. Are there council reports? Mayor Brown. Yes, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| you, Mary. I wanted to announce on December the 13th, the Tennessee Municipal League District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=938)|
| 0:15:46| 2 will have a meeting here in the small assembly room and that will be from 10 a.m. to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=946)|

| 0:16:03| you and thanks for serving as the District 2 Director, I guess on that, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| We're also making sure that the new council members, they won't be sworn in yet, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| want to make sure that they know about it as well. That's really where we review a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| of the legislation that we expect we'll be seeing out of Nashville in the coming session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| and that's where we as cities talk with our Municipal League staff and our lobbyists about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| how we want to address certain issues that might come up at the state level. Okay, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| other? Councilman Stair. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to announce as part of the walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| speaker series, Active Knox is having Jeff Randolph from Greenville. He's a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1001)|

| 0:18:06| Okay, so I don't have anybody signed up except Mr. Kuntz is here, so we will hear from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| sir. Go ahead. You have up to five minutes. Please state your name and address for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| record and thank you for being here. Thank you. Gary Kuntz, 3232 Tassel Pike. Before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| I speak, I've got two people that would like to speak on our behalf, and I told them two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| minutes because I like to talk a little longer than they do. Pardon me? I told them two minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| so I could talk longer. You only get five, though. I know it. We'll let them speak as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| well. Thank you. Hi, I'm Denise Howard with Realty Executives. I'm the list agent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| property at 6907 Central Avenue Pike. We are asking for a rezoning of C4. I've had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| property listed for 834 days. I had one interested party that wanted to use it to grow tomatoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1133)|
| 0:19:02| and then they walked away when they saw the condition of the home. My uncle owns this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| property, currently resides in Middle Tennessee. He has a failing health and has not been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| to maintain the property properly over the last probably six to seven years. And of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| the property is currently rented, and you do the best you can to get renters in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| that will take care of the property, but it just doesn't always work as much as we try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| to have a good connection. The property is currently surrounded by commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| If you're standing on the front porch, to the right is a small women's boutique. To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| the left, I mean, not to the right, I'm sorry, it's a vacant lot. And then all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| the intersection of Callahan and Central goes to Rusty Wallace Honda. Across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| is a church, and then commercial all the way up to past Weigel's on to Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| That includes Aledio's Pizza. So there is commercial all around it. The residents that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| are around it have signed saying that they have no objection to the property being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| So we have a willing and able buyer. My uncle is a willing seller. So I ask you to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| this rezoning. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| Hi, I'm Brandon Boulding. I am at 3717 Henderson Road. I own Integrity Lawn and Landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| and am in the process of pursuing purchase of the property on Central Avenue Pike. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| do high-end residential and commercial construction, installation, and maintenance. The use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| this property would be for a showplace for us to represent our work, the type of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| that we do. So it would be, the house would be used for our offices. We would maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| that property in a very nice manner to where it is very attractive on Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| It would be a commercial establishment. Behind the property, or behind the house, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| a total property of around five acres. So we would have a warehouse behind that to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| our equipment and vehicles to operate out of. But the front of the property would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| maintained in a very nice way to represent the type of work that we do. We really try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| to live up to our name, Integrity Lawn and Landscaping, and do quality work that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| represent who we are well. So I would appreciate your consideration of the rezoning so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| we can move forward in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Mr. Kuntz, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you. I sent, hopefully all the councilmen got the letter I sent out last Friday. To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| be honest with you, I'm a lousy at email, so if you didn't get it, I apologize to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| The property consists of 5.8 acres. Of the 5.8 acres, there's about two and a half acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| in the flood zone, plus there's a creek that runs through the property. As most of y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| know, with the creek, I'm limited to 25 foot from the center both ways. The property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1333)|
| 0:22:21| we've talked to all the neighbors, and none of the neighbors have complained or have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| problems. They're all for us. Most of y'all know Richard Beam. Richard Beam is the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| homeowner, property owner, next to this property. I spoke with Richard, and I think Richard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| spoke with the councilman, and he's very much for it. They've had quite a bit of problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| with the renters in there, and Richard would like to have somebody nice in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| We're asking for C-4. We originally, and that's why I got a little confused. Maybe Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| can help me with this. We originally thought we was wanting C-4, but MPC told me to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| City Codes. City Codes said because of the storage outside, I needed a C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| And seriously, as a real estate broker, I've been around a lot, 40 years, selling real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| estate in this area. And the R-2 zoning, nobody wants to live out there on R-2. There's apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| you know, you don't want to build apartments. Nobody's going to build apartments out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| And I think a lot of this one-year amendment needs to be reviewed. And we talked to several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| developers, and they really agreed with me on that. But if anybody has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| I feel, you know, ask me questions about it, I'd be happy to answer them for you. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| a list of five, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| You had two more minutes, but that's okay. They may have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| I got a couple jokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| That's okay. Though we may need those later on in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| Okay, Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Well, I want to ask you, and also Mr. Green, why not a lesser commercial zone like C-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| or something else? Why do you need C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| Gerald Green, MPC. Mr. Koontz was correct in that the C-3 does not permit outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| And with the use proposed, the outdoor storage would be required. And I'll just add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| that what MPC has to consider, both staff and the Commission, is not the particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| use, but all the uses permitted in the C-4 zoning district. And that was one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| for MPC's recommendation of denial on this. While this use may be somewhat benign, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| assure you that there are uses in the C-4 district that may not be as attractive on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| We're doing the property and not the particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| But I thought he said that they had a warehouse where they were going to store their equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| So what's being displayed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| I believe Bill would have to ask him. I would imagine with a landscaping business, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| would be mulch, there would be equipment, there would be the stone, the timbers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| they use in their installations, a number of items that would be outdoor storage based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| on other landscaping businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| And so because it's outdoors, you think that it's C-4 or not C-4, but C-3 doesn't do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| C-3 does not allow outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| What about a condition that would limit it to certain kinds of things and not undesirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I would defer to, sometimes my opinion of conditions that can be placed on zoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| different from the city law department, so I would defer to them on questions of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| I think within certain parameters that they will describe, conditions could be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| but I would defer to the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| The gentleman that was here said he was going to do a nice thing, but we're doing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| not his particular use, it just facilitates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| I trust this gentleman and Mr. Koontz, but in my experience, verbal promises are worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| the paper they're written on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| Krista, I guess you're the zoning chief. What's going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| As far as conditions on rezonings, what Mr. Green was referring to is the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1571)|
| 0:26:20| makes the position that conditions need to be related to the physical attributes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| the property, landscaping, setbacks, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| When you get into adding conditions that restrict the uses that are allowed by right in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| zoning code, it's a little less clear under state law whether that's permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| It's not been clearly decided, and so we're taking a cautious approach on that, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Is there a use on review type approach where they have to approve the specific use of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| We would take a similar position on that because it could be legislating within legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| So you're saying it's not a good idea to try to condition it on a permitted use not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| permitted, in essence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Not the best idea, but the law's not clear on it, so until a court tells us specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| whether that would be allowed, our position is not to proceed in that manner, but counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| and MPC can obviously choose otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| This is your chance to get to the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Mr. Frost, could you help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| If you want to start conditioning things, whether it's making it subject to a use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| review, I do not, and Mr. Green can certainly correct me if I'm wrong, but those items were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| not considered at MPC, so for those things to be considered, I respectfully submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| it would need to be referred back to MPC for that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| You're saying there's an additional base to touch if we were to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| MPC considered a C-4, and it considered the one-year plan amendment, and the staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| The staff and the commission were consistent with each other, so Mr. Koontz, as his right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| I'll disappeal this before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Well, on the MPC, Mr. Frost, the vote was 6-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| At the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| The vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| The vote was 6-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| He's talking about whether they talked about a specific condition or whatever and evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| that as planners, not what the vote was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| I have a pull-up set up, and Mr. Green can probably answer this for me, on C-3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| It says that open storage of materials and equipment, including to permit use, provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| that all such open storage bill contains, on the setback, it's screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1724)|
| 0:28:53| I pulled this from your office website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| I can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Mr. Frost has the answer sheet up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| He's digging it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Appendix B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| And, like I say, we're just trying to get this worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| That's why I was asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Is there any other zone that's less, what, community unfriendly, so to speak, than C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| You know, we had the neighborhood and stuff complaining, I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| But we had those three big orange signs out there for about three weeks, and nobody complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| We went and talked to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Nobody complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| You're in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| C-3, what's the uses permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| For some legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| So C-3 uses permitted are retail establishments, including incidental manufacturing of goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| for sale at retail on the premises, provided it's a size requirement that probably doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| apply to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Sale and display rooms and lots, not including yards for storage of new or used building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| materials, or yards for any scrap or salvage operations, or for storage or display of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| scrap, salvage, or secondhand materials, delicatessens and bakeries, certain restaurants, automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| service and repair establishments that are conducted within a completely enclosed building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1818)|
| 0:30:28| tire recapping, personal service establishments such as beauty and barber shops, hotel, motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| indoor commercial recreation structures, commercial parking lots and garages, offices, studios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| financial institutions, private clubs, utility substation, indoor pet services and veterinarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| establishments, public buildings, churches, business and vocational schools, not of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| industrial character, contractors, business such as electrical paint or plumbing contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| Before you go much further, you talked about building materials that's used or recycled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Does it say in that new stuff that he would put out, I guess, plant material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| That I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| I recall the used and salvage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Which is not what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Right down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| New or used building materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| So I guess the question would be, you know, the stones for building paths and retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| And I do know that the Plants Review and Administration Department has consistently ruled that C3 does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1894)|
| 0:31:43| not permit outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Other than daily display of sales item where a business may put a rack of slacks outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| for the day to sell and take in in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| And the C4 district specifically sets requirements for outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| And so it is permitted in the C4 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| If you look at the property, if you go behind the house about 50 feet, the property drops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| And Mr. Boggles plan on putting a price that fits up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Because he's, like I say, this place is going to be a show place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| And so from there back, it's all flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| You keep, all that's going to be good for is just keep, as my dad said about land like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| that, it just keeps a good world together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| So I really don't see a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| I think it'd be a plus to, really be a plus to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| And Mr. Beam may agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Considering the areas, you know, in a transition, there's areas around Knoxville like this where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| it's a major artery up against the interstate and the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| So I'm inclined to help Mr. Coons and the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| But I do think the concern of what can come in at C4 needs to be addressed and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| should go back to the Planning Commission for further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| So I've got some legal language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| I'd like to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| I move that pursuant to Tennessee Code Antidote Section 13-3-304B2, the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| Commission consider an amendment of the one-year comprehensive development plan of the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| of Knoxville to General Commercial and Floodway for properties located on the west side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Central Avenue Pike, north of Callahan Drive in the City of Knoxville, known by its tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| identification number of parcel ID 075078, containing approximately 5.18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| And, you know, when I first contacted MPC about this request, there are a handful of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| properties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| There's no opposition, but it, you know, lends itself to review since it is surrounded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I think we need to look at the handful of parcels that are lying along there for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| appropriate uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| So it's the motion by Councilman Campin to refer this back to MPC as his motion describes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| And you have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Is there any issue legally with what the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| I would like to add, if I could, Mayor, the idea that they also look at any conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| that could be imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Because I understand that we can't change permitted uses, but we can require screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| and time of day and things that make it less either offensive or conflicting with neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| So I would ask that they look at that as a planning commission and see if they have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| advice that sort of gets us by the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| And if not, then no, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Go ahead, Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Councilman Campin, did your motion refer to the one-year plan only, or do you have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| motion on the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Or did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| What was your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Well, I was under the impression that under 10B, I could read that as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| So right now we have a motion to refer this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| And you accepted what Councilman Ilovopoulos just asked to add to it for the review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Did you get that well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Well, in the recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| I'll get it in writing from Mr. Campin after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| And so did you second this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| So, Gerald, does that get you what, you know, is that what you need to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Gary, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Now on 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Which is the same result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| 10B is an ordinance to rezone property located from R2, A1, and F1 districts to C4 and F1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Property located on the west side of Central Avenue Pike, north of Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Gary Kuntz, applicant, on appeal from decision of MPC, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Yeah, I'd just move to approve with those conditions stated before of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| and consider it as a conditional use on review, if appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Studied by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| To be studied by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Studied by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| So we have the motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Everybody know what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2190)|

| 0:36:34| Thank you, Mr. Kuntz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| 11A is a resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| and make a recommendation to City Council regarding a possible change to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| classification of the properties in proximity to Midway Road and Interstate 40 from C-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| Highway and Arterial Commercial District to a planned development district, and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| extent required, amending the one-year plan, comprehensive development plan, and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| plan for the City of Knoxville to amend the classification of all such property, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| Councilman Delano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| I'm going to move that we go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| I think this is in keeping both with the discussion we had about C-4 at the intersection on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| north side, but it would apply to north and south, looking at a different zone, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| And that is covered, by the way, in the plan that's coming up for that whole French Broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| corridor area that is by this exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| And that's what we would recommend as one of the action items that they come to City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| Council and have that zoning examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| This is a chance for MPC to say there's a better way to manage that zoning in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| So I think we should send it to them and get their advice so that Council can act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| While I applaud, Councilman Delano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| You made a motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Is there a second to that yet or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| So, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| While I applaud Councilman de la Volpe's concern for the development of this area, I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| that since other things are in the works, including the French Broad plan, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| rezoning, recoding, that this is maybe premature and that we need to not pass this so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| we don't have this on the record or MPC comes back, spends a lot of time, and then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| something else that conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| So I would, again, while I applaud Councilman de la Volpe's concern and I, too, am concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| I do think that we're creating work maybe where there's already a lot of work happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| So I will not be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Councilwoman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Have you made any attempt, Nick, to contact the property owner and talk to them about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| whether they'll support that or be just done as one layer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| You know, this was on the agenda two weeks ago with the rezoning of that track and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| recommendation, if you recall, of MPC to make it PC1 or PC2 because that enabled them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| to address hillside ridgetop guidelines, which they would not be able to do under C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| But I will tell you that there have been months, literally months, maybe even longer, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| a year, on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| I know it's on our agenda, and shame on me, I can't find the reference here real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| but it is on, it is in that plan, and it was only postponed so others would have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| to look at it, that that intersection be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| So I think we should give them the chance to look at it, and they'll take whatever time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| MPC does to study it and come back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| It might be nothing, it might be something, but I think the review of the land needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Obviously residents as well as the owner and everyone else will be contacted and be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| But no attempts have been made to contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Not by me personally, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2403)|

| 0:40:09| Do you want to roll call on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2409)|

| 0:42:33| This project is a mixed use development in downtown north that's going to be a very great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| effort in our revitalization of the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| It consists of a historic office building that would be redeveloped and also a vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| property that would be demolished adjacent to it to allow for retail and office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| We think this is a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| We do have the developers here, Daniel Odole as well as Joe Petrie is here on behalf to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| speak on the development for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Just one point of inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| I thought the buildings, the modern buildings that were being demolished were for 30 apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Maybe I'm thinking of something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| No, the historic structure will be redeveloped and I think they do have someone available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| that's planning to lease the building already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| There's two existing structures next to it that will be demolished to create 33 residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| unit apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Okay, you said commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| It's a mixed use of retail and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| It's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| And this is for 13 year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| The request is for a 13 year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Is that what your office is recommending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| They did do a third party review with Municap and the Municap report did indicate that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| 13 year would support their, make it financially viable with that 13 year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| And so your department is recommending it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Also, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2638)|

| 0:44:08| the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| We've got to sell this thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| I'm happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| I'm Joe Petrie with Conversion Properties, 520 West Summit Road, Avenue Suite 903, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| And I don't have any jokes like Gary, but I would start with referring back to our groundbreaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2663)|
| 0:44:32| of Regas Square, different partners, but same development management company, Conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| And most of you were kind enough to come and the mayor was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| And in her remarks, I remember distinctly, she said, you know, when Joe started doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Southeastern Glass, we all thought he was crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| And so we took that to heart, Mayor, and here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| It's another crazy project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Conversion Properties is about taking the kind of risk that we need to take to restart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| And so just like we did at Southeastern Glass before Walter was there and John Sanders and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| Brandon Pace's workshops were there and Knox Whiskey Works and all that, you know, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| out on that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| And so this is another one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I don't know if you have seen this property or know much about the property, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| it fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| It's on Tyson Street and Jennings Street, the corner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| We bought a property from Scott Parton and Mahasi Vafai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| We actually sold them another property and we hope for a really good development out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| of that on North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| And so we thought, well, let's see what we can do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| So ultimately, it's a couple of parcels that we're actually doing in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| And Mr. Della Volpe was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| It's mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| It's really a commercial office building that's already there that will be revamped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| That's the historic one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| That's the historic one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| And then we are taking down two other buildings in a second phase and doing the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| The apartments will front Tyson Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Tyson Street, the only thing it looks at is Old Gray Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| Now, Old Gray is going to be revamped and supposedly they'll put about $650,000 into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| Old Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| So that's our view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| And that's a pretty good view, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| I mean, most people wouldn't think that, but it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| You're looking out over a nice cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| It's west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| It's historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| If you ever walk that cemetery, it's really wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| It's Knoxville's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| So many notable people have been laid to rest there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And so we're proud to be its neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| We have some other neighbors that we'd love to work with and kind of raise the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| And so the third-party review doesn't always take full consideration, in our opinion, of the risk factors at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2801)|
| 0:46:51| And we're pretty far out on a limb there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| And we want to do this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| It's $5.6 million, $5.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| It is one of those things that easily passes the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| And so here we are again asking for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| And we had actually originally requested a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| And we're happy to settle for the 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| It helps tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| And it makes the project work just as the pilot's supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| Well, Joe, we appreciate the risks that you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| Those risks have really turned into some really great projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| I'm not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| I have many partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Right, you and your partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| And with this, we hope to minimize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| It's still a risk, but we hope to minimize it some through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Yeah, Joe, some of us are excited that you're going to be new neighbors down in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| And it is a risk that I understand, but I think it's one worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| Is this going to be workforce housing, or what are you looking for in terms of tenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| And what are the sizes of the units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Yeah, Councilman Grieve, we are at a price point that we think it actually should be and can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| We need as much rent as we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| But that's the purpose of this, because what's missing from that new area downtown north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| If you look at our projects and what we've been doing, what we are doing, we're really pretty linear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| We're going from Gay Street up to Gay Street and Depot with Regas Square, 16 Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| Now here, we'd like to go beyond this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| But we're really in a pretty straight line as far as the development projects we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| We think what's missing is workforce housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| And so we would hope to attract that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| It's a series of one- and two-bedroom apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| The two bedrooms would be roommates, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| And so that means that two people working in that area should be able to afford to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| And just as downtown, people are getting priced out of some of these redevelopment areas already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| because of the price of getting into the development, the cost of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| and then the construction costs in these districts are quite high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| They're in a fire district, just more code-intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| But we think we're in a sweet spot where we could attract that, just by nature of having some two bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| We'll also have some ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| Yes, Mr. Petrie, I want to ask you about the rental prices just by a park of what these apartments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2964)|
| 0:49:33| Yeah, I may need to refer to my partner, Mr. Odle, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| But basically, in the dollar, I think of it in terms of square foot, so you can interpret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Monthly rates on two-bedroom will be $1,250 to $1,400 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| One-bedroom will be $700 to $850 a month, depending on where they are in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| And I think in the packet it mentions something about permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| Did I read that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| There was a reference to a tenant that Ms. Foster said, and we have a letter of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| We're working on a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| The office building is 8,900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| We use all three floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| We would be reworking what's not a working basement right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And this company has, I think, about ten employees right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| They're moving from Farragut, so win one for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| But we hope that they grow, and their plan is to grow to what would consume the building of about 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3028)|
| 0:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3041)|

| 0:50:55| and, if awarded, accept a grant from the Tennessee Department of Transportation to provide funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| in an amount of $225,000 to Knoxville Area Transit for Improve Act grant assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3060)|

| 0:51:12| and install three replacement in-ground bus lifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3072)|

| 0:51:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| I'm collaborating with the Landscape Company doing some work over at the shoreline of Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| and I don't know that this is anything, but I'm going to recuse myself just for conflict of interest's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Okay, so any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3113)|

| 0:53:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| We have two people who wish to speak on this, Bob Wolfenbarger and DeEtte Crockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| So if you would like to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| Okay, so you'll be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| So, Bob, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| Bob Wolfenbarger, 8416 Kodak Road, speaking on behalf of the 8th District Preservation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| We're not speaking in opposition, but we are extremely disappointed that this whole process began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3219)|
| 0:53:51| and was in the process for four months before the 8th District Preservation Association found out about it by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| If you look on the second page of the plan, you'll find that all the steering committee members are from the same neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3237)|
| 0:54:07| the same area of East Knotts County, and no one from the Thorn Grove or Midway communities were involved in the steering committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3247)|
| 0:54:18| Therefore, we didn't have any influence in how the process was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| Secondly, with that said, for this kind of plan to be successful, it requires significant community understanding and buy-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3264)|
| 0:54:37| When you exclude more than 50% of the population of the river community of Midway and Thorn Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| that is going to inhibit the potential for this plan to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| I would encourage you as a legislative body to know that, but more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3290)|
| 0:55:01| not condone that kind of selection by the NPC staff and director for future plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3301)|
| 0:55:11| We'd appreciate any support you can give to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| I hope you readdress, by the way, the item that Councilman De La Volpe reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3316)|
| 0:55:25| As you know, we talked for two weeks consistently about PC2 on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| We'd like to see that follow through, since it's a very important and major component in this plan you're about to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| DeEtte Crockett, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| DeEtte Crockett, 7801 Kodak Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| I've lived in that area for almost 20 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| I went to the 2010 meetings and attended all but one of the meetings that NPC hosted for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3358)|
| 0:56:06| I feel that many community members attended those meetings and that we had an opportunity to give our input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| ask questions, and most of us do want the benefit of an updated community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| I personally support it, and I'm also a member of the French Broad Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| which also supports this new community plan because it helps protect the French Broad River Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| So I would like for you to vote yes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| You know, for several years, I just want to add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| For several years, we have looked at how do we protect the French Broad Riverfront and corridor there and the scenic aspects of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| but also allowing for some business activity and some support of the communities that live out there without destroying the rural nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| And this plan does, I think, a good job of tackling the various viewpoints and expressing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| and setting sort of a road map of how they might go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| So all things considered, it's a healthy plan that hopefully will be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| Of course, you can have a plan and not implement it, and it just sits on a shelf and gathers dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| But this is one that has recommended that they follow through with neighborhood and community activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| and so I think it is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| I think it merits your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| We're on 12-D, and we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| 12-E is an ordinance amending and adopting the historic design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| for the existing Edgewood Park City Historic District Zoning Overlay, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Well, this is the prelude, obviously, to the one that's been moved up right behind it with regard to the Park Ridge area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3482)|
| 0:58:12| I think it would be helpful if we have one of the representatives for this plan work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| whether it's Ms. Graybiel or Ms. Trent or someone if they're out there or someone from those departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| But, you know, the question that's been raised is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| are these guidelines either too complex or too strict for homeowners trying to fix up a small household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3508)|
| 0:58:38| and live on a tight budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| And so I wanted to hear what they have to say about that general concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| It does a nice job of talking about the history of the area and the type of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| and what's worth preserving out there, but there is the question that has been raised about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| are we making it too hard for, you know, everyday working folks with a limited income to do normal fixing up of your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3536)|
| 0:59:05| So I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| We have one person who has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| We have a friend who's volunteering to jump into the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Before she – we do have one person signed up to speak on this issue, on 12E, who's signed up against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3551)|
| 0:59:20| Well, that's okay, but I'd like to hear what is good about this, not so much in terms of particulars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| but how we make this, or is it, user-friendly to the extent that people who don't have either a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| or a lot of money can still keep their house in good shape and keep it healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| without kind of like jumping through too many hoops of fire to get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| Well, I'm here to be your myth buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| All right, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| That's what I'm wanting to find, the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| So I sent an email to Council – oh, by the way, Kim Trent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| Executive Director of Knox Heritage 516 Carter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| Knox Heritage and MPC have stepped up to address community concerns about costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| related to proposed district expansion in the Park Ridge neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| The Knox Heritage Board is committed to paying the costs of applying for a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| for repairs or improvements for all low-to-moderate income homeowners in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| as well as offering discounts at the Knox Heritage salvage shop for low-to-moderate income residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| and a smaller discount, but still a discount, for all residents in the proposed district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| But we've also worked with neighborhood residents and MPC to host three community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| over the last few months to review and update the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| that were adopted in 1997 for the original district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Significant revisions were made and approved to reduce repair and rehab costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| by limiting Historic Zoning Commission review to only exteriors that are visible from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| Prior to these meetings with residents, the review was from all four sides of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| I, for one, think if you can't see it from the street, it shouldn't be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| so those changes were made for these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| Then we also went in and looked at allowing people to maintain their non-historic materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| So if you have vinyl siding in place and it needs to be repaired and it's already there, you can put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| But I would contend that a lot of the expense that people have on historic houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| are brought to them by the window salesman and the vining salesman who has an easily monthly payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| and so you buy an entire house of vinyl siding rather than repairing three poplar boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| that might be rotten on the front or the side of your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| So we came at this whole concept with the neighborhood of a doing no further harm concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| so if you've got it, you can repair it and keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| If you're going to change it or you have original materials, it would be better to repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| That's often more affordable than doing wholesale replacement with new materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| This is the first time this has been done in local design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| and we believe it addresses concerns about the cost of repairs being more expensive in the overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| We also undertook a cost comparison for typical repairs and replacements of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| on the portions of structures visible from the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| I shared that with you in an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| We did this in cooperation with two local contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| who have extensive experience rehabbing historic properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| and we have found that repairing existing materials is often more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| than replacing entire elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| and we want to encourage that type of activity in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| We also have found there is not a dramatic difference in cost for basic replacement elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| The homeowners are free to purchase and install more expensive options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| that meet the design guidelines if they choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| So we've priced it out, and I think a lot of times people spend money they don't need to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| replacing all the siding with vinyl or all the windows with new windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| Windows aren't the answer to your utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| I'm here to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| The reason I ask that, and I attended several of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| but people would say, look, I can go out and buy at Home Depot or Lowe's or one of those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| a vinyl window for, I don't know, let's say $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| If I have to get a fancy wood window, I might spend $900 or $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| and that's going to really destroy my opportunity to do the repairs I'd like to do as Harry the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3790)|
| 1:03:19| Did you have a moment to review the cost comparison that I shared with Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| and the attachment last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| You'll see that you can buy a high-end Pella Architect Series window that's going to cost you a fortune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| You can also buy a very affordable wood window that's comparable in price to a vinyl window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| But in this district, if you have a vinyl window and you want to repair it or replace it, you can put back vinyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| Okay, well, that's really the question because I don't know if you've bought wood windows lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Oh, I've bought a lot of windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| I will tell you that 50 years ago they used old-growth southern yellow pine full of pitch that didn't rot easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3829)|
| 1:03:58| and now they make these fast-growth pine things that the wood is like a sponge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| and it will fail in five or six or seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| They ain't what they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| The old materials are really better in the sense that they were durable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| but I guess the environmental rules now say don't cut an old-growth forest, and so they don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| There aren't any left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| Well, there may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| But that's why we ask people or encourage people, don't replace your historic windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Most of them can be repaired inexpensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Buy a full-glass storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| It is so much cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Your return on your investment is five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| If you buy one of these fancy new wood windows, it's 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| A storm window and a tight, insulated original window is a better deal for homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| and so in a lot of ways I feel like we're saving people from wasting their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| when the salesman shows up on their door with an easy payment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| that ends in a foreclosure of their house in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| But do you have an education program that makes this more understandable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| if I'm a local resident and I don't have time to maybe study the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3892)|
| 1:04:58| Yeah, I mean, Kay Graybiel is a great resource for anyone who comes up at her office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| We offer that service for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| We just did a workshop two weeks ago or a week ago with U.S. Green Building Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| to show how to do really affordable energy-efficiency work on your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| that basically talks about spray foam and insulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| and telling people how to do this in smart ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| It also conserves historic materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| The reason I ask these questions is I think the big sticking point on this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| how big a district should this overlay be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| and should it be a neighborhood conservation overlay or a historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| comes down to are we going to end up running poor people out of their homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| People are getting by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| And we're getting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| We're not killing them with kindness here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| We need to make sure that we have a mechanism that's flexible enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| so that it encourages saving the historic features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| but doesn't kill the homeowner in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| This is the most flexible set of design guidelines in the city of Knoxville for a historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| We spent more time on this than any other district in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| There's affordable housing in Mechanicsville, in Old North, in Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| There's affordable housing in all of those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| And part of what makes Park Ridge affordable is that there are small houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| And we're sort of getting into the discussion about the district expansion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| about what's going to happen or what's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| But affordability goes way beyond the cost of repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| It goes on to what's happening in the market there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| and what people are going to do when they come into the neighborhood with new investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| That is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| And so we're trying to say, how do we maintain these smaller shotguns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| and queen-end cottages and bungalows that are 1,200, 1,300 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Because if we go the way of major cities across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| the land's going to be more valuable than the little house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| They're going to do the teardown, and they're going to build the upper-income new house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| that doesn't fit in with the neighborhood, and it's not going to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| It's a pattern that repeats over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| You think it's flexible enough to make it affordable to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| And there's actually people opposed to the update because they think it's too flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| So we try to be really open to how do we encourage repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| or how do we make it affordable to do these repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| and be a resource so that people don't spend money that they don't really need to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| Or they don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Or they don't have, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Vice Mayor Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| I think, and the rest of Council, several of us have served 15, 12, 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| on the Historic Zoning Commission, and I have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| This is the most flexible guideline set that I'm familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| starting way back at even Mechanicsville in terms of what we had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| And for this set of guidelines to be set up in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| that you're only concerned about the front of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| that's a major change from the other guidelines that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| And also the fact that what you're talking about is that you can repair whatever the damage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| with what you already have, and that flexibility is far greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| than any other of our historic districts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| And so I think that between, from what I understand, between the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| between the neighborhoods, between you folks, between Kay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| that they've come up with a very flexible set of guidelines for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| And that's what we're talking about right now in this particular issue at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| We're talking about these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| And I, for one, totally support these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| I think they're flexible enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I think they really tie into the bungalows and the small houses and things like that that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| because I think what we have to be aware of is just like what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| that there are people looking for land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| and they're looking for land to tear down what's already there and change the character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| And all of us on council, we've had to deal with different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| where we've had habitat go in and the problems that those neighborhoods have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| in terms of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| So I'm in full support of this set of guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| and I think it's a real example of what can be done for particular neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| We're not trying to put a set of guidelines onto this group that another set has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| And so I commend you for that, and I definitely support this, and I make a motion we accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| Do we have another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| We have a motion and a second already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| We do have someone to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Yes, Wade Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Can you hear Wade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| My name is Wade Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| I live at 2346 Woodbine Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| And it's just so I'm going to try to stay focused, but this really is all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| And speaking to the flexibility of the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| I will admit that they have done a tremendous amount in adding flexibility to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4199)|
| 1:10:08| to the point where 10 or 20 years from now, Park Ridge could end up looking like an old western| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| where you just have the front facades of the buildings and block houses in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| because there's no protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Your George Barber homes in the neighborhood, your Crown Victorians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| it takes away all the protections you have of those for the rest of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| except for the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| It takes that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| I don't understand how that is historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| In my mind, that isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| The reason they have had to be this flexible on this front is because the people don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| And this is done to appease people who don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| From there, I'd get into more nuts and bolts on the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| Kay Graybiel through MPC, she set up a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| I don't completely understand it, but it's a process of pre-vetting public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| which was done through Park Ridge Community Organization in secret as far as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| No one really knows what happened with the public input that they have processed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| on behalf of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Was that information stored?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Was it saved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Was it reserved for records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Did MPC set up any guidelines using this community organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| as a semi-quasi-government organization to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| I would hope that somebody is interested in answering that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| because I haven't been able to get an answer for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| The only answer I've been able to get, because I've been pretty direct with asking Kay about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| is we've done other public functions in this, that, and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| so that's not the only source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| It's like, okay, if you took that to an election, you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| okay, we're counting the votes in these precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| but we're not going to count the votes in this one because we're doing these three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| I don't think it applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| I think there are questions there that somebody should be asking of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| and how that was run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Further on this, you are being asked to approve guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| that our community will have to live by that is filled with false statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4340)|
| 1:12:28| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| I personally call them lies, but that's not politically correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| Vinyl windows, in here it says they can't be repaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| and different things of that nature, and you have to replace the whole window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| That's a false statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Vinyl windows can be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Vinyl siding, it also states in here that vinyl siding can't be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| It also says that it doesn't allow moisture that gets behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| It doesn't allow moisture to come back out and it will damage the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| Vinyl siding is designed with weep holes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| so that moisture that does get behind there, it is designed to weep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| These are nuts and bolts, things that won't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4388)|
| 1:13:16| But there are other things in here, other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| I proposed a question on a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| trying to get a better understanding of how the 50% contributing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| What meets that threshold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| I was told by NPC that I had to go back to the people who did the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| in the early 90s to get them to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| I was giving contact information for somebody out of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| and when I reached out to that person, I have no idea what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Absolutely no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| This is an issue in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| and I'm being referred by the NPC to people in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| that don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| There are just so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| You shouldn't be asked to pass false documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| You shouldn't be asked by NPC to vote on, to pass documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| that have knowingly false information in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| You should not be asked to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| I would ask that all of you take this to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| My request would be to send this back to the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| and ask if you could possibly appoint an independent person to oversee this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| and have this fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Okay, council, that's one more person asked to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Are you all open to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| They didn't sign up ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Okay, that's Mr. Mike Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| Sir, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Mike Anderson, 1730 Washington Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| a 40-year resident of Park City, east Knoxville to some of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| I live in the existing H-1 and have since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| I came back to this country in the late 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| I've lived there ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| I find myself in opposition here, and I'm somewhat struggling with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| because I actually believe that the H-1 overlay had a great deal to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| with the conservation of the legacy of George Franklin Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| That's the 19th century architecture located in the historic Edgewood neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| Here comes the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| We have reduced the guidelines to the point that you put those built items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4530)|
| 1:15:39| properties, 17 specifically, at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| We will lose parts of that architecture over the next 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| without question in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Just one concept that's been pointed out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| Well, we're only concerned with the street view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| what it looks like directly in front of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Have you ever walked around a George Barber architecture home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Four walls, four pieces of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| But we want to disregard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| I'm troubled by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Now, we talk about the workforce housing located in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| in this expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| We're talking primarily about bungalows, World War II era, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| 19th century property and World War II era properties are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| We have distinctly separate neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| An 1800s neighborhood and a 1900s neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| How do you have guidelines that fit both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| I'll tell you, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| It's been suggested at both the MPC and the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| that separate overlays be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| For some reason, we don't choose to regard that as a doable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| When we look at the national overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| primarily in the expansion area we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| it stretches along Fifth Avenue from Winona to Cho Howie Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| We will end up with multiple overlays here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| but what we're going to do if we agree to this expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| and if we agree to these guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| is we're going to lose a lot of the historic built fabric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| that exists in a 19th century neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| No question in my mind about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Please send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I also have a consideration about the history that's been mentioned here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| In consulting the records of Michael Alcorn of Nebraska University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| one of the premier knowledgeable individuals on Barber architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| and Chris DeMott of UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| also considerably knowledgeable regarding Barber architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| Myself, who've been a student of Barber architecture for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| tremendous number of errors and inconsistencies about that history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Again, I suggest that these guidelines be returned to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| It was offered of Ms. Graybill that we would sit down with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| and work on correcting these inconsistencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| but there was no response from their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Okay, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Before he leaves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Let me call on Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| If the guidelines do not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| how will that affect the next audience that we are going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| Let me ask the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| If these updates to the guidelines do not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| the existing guidelines would be applied to the existing historic district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| and if the Council chooses to expand that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| the existing guidelines would be applied to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| There were several statements made about MPC not responding and accuracies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| On behalf of my staff, I take offense to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| I would appreciate it if people would speak more directly to the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| when they come up and discuss breach stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| where slights of public employees don't sit well with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| My staff did an excellent job with these updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| They spent a lot of time, as Vice Mayor Greene pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| trying to breach compromises to ensure that the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| would be protected while protecting the economics of the people who live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| ensuring the continued affordability of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| I agree with Vice Mayor Greene that the work on these guidelines was excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| I do concur with some of the statements made by those who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| We have reduced the guidelines to where there may be some impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| on the size of the buildings, that they're not compatible with the historic architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| Overall, these guidelines, as proposed with the updates and amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| would protect the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| while assuring that those people who live in the community now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| and who want to live in it in the future can afford to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Gerald, would you say that applying guidelines like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| would add to the stability of the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| How do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| I think it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| I think Ms. Trent made a good point that as the land becomes more valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| as more people want to live in these neighborhoods that are walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| that are accessible to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| that the land will be seen as a more important commodity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| than the homes within the historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| The lots could be bought, the homes demolished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| and new homes out of character with the neighborhood built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| More expensive homes, larger homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| I think that, as Ms. Trent said, that has happened in other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| and we can anticipate seeing it in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Those projects like Mr. Petrie talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| that enhance our downtown, continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| and people want to live close and accessible to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| The intention is to bring stability to neighborhoods that are fragile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| and that are in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| It's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| It's very similar to what Mr. Koontz is facing out there on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| You have transition neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| This is an effort to bring stability to that and add consistency to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| to see that those areas are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I applaud your efforts to try to compromise, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| I see some that are maybe taking it too far, and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| but I applaud your efforts to find a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| and that's what you've been about in your tenure at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| I applaud that as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| There's been a lot of dialogue about this and a lot of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| There's always disagreement, but I think the intention is to, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| is to add stability to a neighborhood that needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| So thanks for your effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| Thank you, and I have to thank Kate Pradyville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| who did all the work as the lead staff person on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| This is a very interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| One thing that occurs to me is that by setting the minimum standards a little lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| we help everyone fix their house, even if they have a low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| It seems to me that that's a minimum and not a maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| and as well as I appreciate what Mr. Anderson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| you can always do more to restore these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| I think he is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| There's almost two historic areas, like from Oliver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| one of those streets west to the mill is one sort of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| and from there to Cherry Street there's a different era of house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| and maybe a smaller house, whether they be Cape Cod's or bungalows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| or call them whatever you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| I don't know all the names that are in the guidelines in terms of styles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| but I assume that these guidelines are to make the minimums more meetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| and that you can always do more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| and if you have a love for the houses in the area, that you will do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| So I don't see us as preventing work on houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| that could have more work on the other three sides, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| But I guess I was concerned that by having such a broad district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| that we could be pressing people who are either renters or owners at the margin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| and so that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Okay, Council, we have one more person asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| who really wants to ask a question, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Will you all entertain that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Would you like to come forward, Ms. Riffey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| We've heard her before, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| It actually wasn't a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| I'm Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| I live at 2320 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| You want to make a statement about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| He had asked me if I was for or against, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| well, it's really I wanted to make some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Council, we've had two speakers on this at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| so typically we would hear three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| So without objection, Kenny, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Very quickly, just some points came up that I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Actually, we've had, well, you asked for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| and then this is the third one who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| For the barber houses, there's a national register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| Those houses can be fully protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| by putting them on a national register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| That solves that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| We're talking about 700-plus houses going under an overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| and barber houses are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| They're a Knoxville asset and treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| Let's preserve them by making sure that each individual house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| is protected regardless of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| That was the point I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| Second is there are two houses on my block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| that are being renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I'm pretty sure, well, one of them I know sold for $14,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| It's currently in the process of being renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| and I feel quite certain that when it's finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| it'll be a $200,000 house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| They did not come in, buy that for $14,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| and tear it down and build a big house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| They decided what they wanted to do was to fix the house up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| and that's what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| There's a second house that was purchased for about $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| They're in the process of doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| That will be another $200,000 house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| If you look at the housing prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| the sale prices of the houses in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| they are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| They're consistent with what's going on in the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| in general in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| And at this point, nobody really seems that I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| has come in to tear down a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| and build up a big house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| What they're doing is coming in and buying the existing houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| putting the money into them, and fixing them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| I know a lot of people who are in the process of doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| in the homes they live in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| I am a licensed general contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| I had a client who was in a historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| and I needed to replace 18 porch boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| The rest of the porch was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| I went down to pull a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| I was told I had to go downstairs to historic zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| I had to ask for a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| I had to pay a separate fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| And at that point, nobody was available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| to approve those 18 porch boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| So I had to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| If I'm a homeowner who works in a minimum-waste job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| and I want to replace 18 porch boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| I've got to ask my employer for the time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| I've got to come all the way down to the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| I've got to make application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| And if the person I make application to isn't available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| I have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| It can become a very tedious, onerous, and expensive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| for 18 porch boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| That has always been my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| about the cost of maintaining these homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| the jumping through hoops of fire and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| We have all seen in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| the two contractors who gave comparative pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| for doing repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| And we all want their names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| because we are not able to find that type of pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| And I did call one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| and did not get a phone call back for some number of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| At least one of the people I know is very busy all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| So getting that kind of pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| is not going to be available to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| As for vinyl, it seems to be one of the favorite topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| I was lead-certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| I chose not to remain lead-certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| I am over lead paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| I am over having to deal with windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| that are covered with lead paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| I like vinyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Wood's great in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| but in these old houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| you have to paint over that lead paint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| and then you have to keep painting over it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| and keep painting over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| You have to do a lot of maintenance with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| So there are opposing arguments to everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| but my bottom line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| that the expense of maintaining a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| is much higher in a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Thank you, Kenny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| Well, that's all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| At this point, we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| 12E, which is amending the historic design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| for that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| That's two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5356)|

| 1:29:43| Okay, we now move on to 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| I mean, 12W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| Sorry, 12W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| Now, just to be clear, for 12W, the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| this is the H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| Those to speak for Kathy Foster, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Lynn Randazzo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| Is Lynn Randazzo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Am I looking at the wrong list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| I'm looking at the wrong list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| I've got too many lists going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| I thought I was getting on top of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| So for the H1 overlay, three speakers for are Kim Trent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| then Jenny Mezek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| Is Jenny here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Jenny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| And Greta Schmoyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Those are the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| And then the three that are signed up against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| that you all have agreed to, are Brandy Slabaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| Brandy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Dr. Sally Serafin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| And Jimmy Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| And those are the ones that will be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| 12W is an ordinance to rezone property from multiple zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| to multiple zoning districts with H1 and design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| property bounded generally by or located on East Glenwood Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| from I-40 to Spruce Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Washington Avenue from Standard Knitting Mill Complex to North Chestnut Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| Jefferson, Woodvine, and East 5th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| and from the Standard Knitting Mill Complex to North Cherry Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| MPC Applicant 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| So let's hear from the speakers from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| First, Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| Again, set your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| Kim Trent, 516 Carter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| I'm here on behalf of Knox Heritage Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| to express our organization's support for the expansion of Edgewood Park City Historic District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| in the Park Ridge neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| We want to thank MPC staff for all the diligent work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| and many hours that Kay Graybill in particular put into this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| and going through this whole process together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| We do want to share some information for your consideration as you prepare to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| First, the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| As you're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Knox Heritage has worked with historic neighborhoods across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| as they have gone through the process of creating or expanding their historic overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| The process in the Park Ridge neighborhood has included more public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| and more time than any other similar process we have seen in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| We think that has been a healthy process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| and helped address resident and property owner concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| As with every historic overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| there are a range of opinions on the proposed district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| and some who do not support the expansion of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| Unanimous agreement, however, is extremely rare in any public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| As with every district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| there has been vocal support and opposition to the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| as well as a significant number of property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| who have not expressed an opinion at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| which was the same in 1996 when we put the original district in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| We are confident, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| that every effort has been made by the Neighborhood Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Knox Heritage, and MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| to inform all residents and owners through multiple mailings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| public notices, multiple meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| to include all voices and work with residents to craft district guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| that address resident concerns and needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| We are also confident that a majority of property owners actively support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| or have no qualms with the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| The demographic changes in the neighborhood have been a topic of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| as well as we've gone through this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| There have been concerns expressed about historic overlay zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| leading to rapid gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Though that may be an easy claim to express,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| especially in light of the currently robust real estate market in the center city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| that has not been the history of the Park Ridge neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| Since the original district was put in place 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| 20 years ago!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| My son was two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| There has not been a rapid change in the demographics of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| I attached census information on the information I sent to you yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| showing over the last four decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| that shows the district has actually experienced gradual change and improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| that have not caused significant displacement of low to moderate income residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| minorities, or renters since the original district was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| Rather, the district has had a positive impact on the visual appearance of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| allowed improvements in home ownership rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| and moderated the increases in housing prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| That type of moderation is more important than ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| as the residential real estate market is now becoming heavily impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| by a demographic shift and a wave of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| That wave has been cresting in cities across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| and is now coming ashore in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| That demographic shift, which includes younger and more affluent residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| is what has really been causing housing prices to rise in the last three to five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| not the historic zoning that has been in place for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| Affordable housing is another issue we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| As prices are now skyrocketing across the center city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| historic overlay zoning is a valuable and effective tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| for maintaining and creating affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| that is compatible with the history and character of Knoxville's historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| The Park Ridge neighborhood was originally built with a mix of affordable and workforce housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| and middle and upper middle income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| Mill workers were neighbors with mill managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| and the variety of housing styles and sizes in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| reflects that range of housing in their square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| Historic overlay zoning will prevent the teardown of smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| naturally more affordable cottages and bungalows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| and the replacement with larger scale housing designed not to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| If prices continue to rise dramatically in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| we will see what has happened in countless cities across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| where smaller affordable historic houses are raised for higher priced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| and larger single family or multifamily developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| that do not respect the existing streetscapes and neighborhood demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| Voting against the overlay will not stop gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| Instead, it will remove a valuable tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| that can be used to help stem the tide of gentrification and displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| We know this has been a very heated issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| as most zoning issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| but we would like to remind you that when this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| on September 30, 2014, voted on the Central City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| you unanimously approved the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| to expand the historic district just as we are proposing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| So we ask for you to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| and follow through with the planning that's been going on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5813)|

| 1:36:55| Jenny Mezek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5815)|
| 1:37:02| Hi, I'm Jenny Mezek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| I live at 2080 East Fifth Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| and that's in the proposed expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| And I wanted to speak about what's happening in our neighborhood right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| to affordability and gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| So gentrification is happening, with or without H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| It's very obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| is a desirable neighborhood because of walkability, its proximity to downtown, the affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| of the housing, and the diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| These are all reasons my husband and I chose to purchase there five and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| As we see in other neighborhoods close to downtown, Forth and Gill, Old North, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| a very low supply of available housing and a very high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| More residents are looking towards Park Ridge and moving into Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| In the last six months in my block, there were two houses that were completely renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| One remained owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| The other was sold just not even a month ago, a few weeks ago, for $165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5877)|
| 1:38:05| The people who sold that house bought it in 2016 for $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| So they made $140,000 minus their expenses into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| The housing prices are rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| Currently there are four houses within sight of mine that are undergoing renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| One was previously an empty blighted property and three were rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| Each one of these is being renovated by an investor group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Some of our investor groups are good, they care about the neighborhood, they're local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| residents, and others are just coming in to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| I was speaking with the people who are renovating the house next door to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| They told me, and this was two weeks ago, they told me that them and other investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| groups are buying everything they can in Park Ridge as it becomes available, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| pulling permits as fast as they can before H1 goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| It's been mentioned several times that Park Ridge has a large amount of smaller homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| Smaller homes are more affordable in energy costs, in maintenance, in purchase price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| in taxes, in insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| Just earlier today I had someone who asked me, is there a craftsman style smaller home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| that you know of available in Park Ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| There are more people looking for those types of smaller homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| Since the district that has H1 was enacted 20 years ago, the proposed expansion area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5969)|
| 1:39:37| has lost 36 of its homes that have been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| I remember in the last five years that I've lived in Park Ridge, two of those homes were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| going to be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| They were pulled from the demolition list, but that list was not updated with the demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| truck driver, and those houses were razed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Historic Overlay protects those smaller homes from being demolished and provides them as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| affordable housing in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Again, when we have less supply of homes and more demand, then the prices rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| That's what's happening across the city and will continue to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| It's happening in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| When we lose our smaller homes, it contributes to that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| Last night I sent everyone an email that had costs of sales prices over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6020)|
| 1:40:31| I just wanted to mention those here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| The average sales price over the last year in the proposed expansion area has been $81| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| In the current H1 area of Park Ridge, the average price has been $75 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| The highest sale price in the proposed expansion area has been $161 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| In the current H1 area, the highest sales price has been $152 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| There's no correlation between what the sales price of the house is going to be and if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| in the district or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Park Ridge is desirable because of the neighborhood it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Now, Greta Schmoyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| My name is Greta Schmoyer, and I live at 1717 East Glenwood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| I'm a veterinarian and public health professional, and I've lived in the H1 overlay expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| area of Park Ridge for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| I am in support of the H1 overlay expansion because it will preserve our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| stock of small, affordable houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| It has been argued that the H1 will unfairly burden our neighborhood's lower income and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| minority members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| This is a concern that all of us take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| There are several measures that have been adopted to ensure that the H1 overlay does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| not become an economic burden on homeowners, including an economic hardship provision and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| the allowance of replacing like materials with like materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| These have been discussed here today and at the many public meetings throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| In the decade I've been in Park Ridge, I have seen no one forced out of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| due to the existing H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| I have seen neighbors forced out due to unequal access to capital, to market forces, to neglect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| of properties by uninvolved, distant landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| I have seen historic houses stripped bare and left open to the elements while neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| had to deal with the blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| The H1 could have prevented that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| It could also prevent those same houses from being torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| Anything built in their place will be intrinsically less affordable than Park Ridge's existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| stock of small historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Opponents of the H1 have held up the NC1 designation as a good alternative to the H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| NC1 does not preserve houses and does nothing for affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| Like Park Ridge, the Fort Sanders neighborhood has had a National Register Historic District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| A visit to Fort Sanders should convince anyone that historic houses, neighborhood character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| and affordability are not preserved by a National Register designation or an NC1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| This is the Fort Sanders Historic Register nomination and we counted these today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| Out of the 350 contributing structures originally listed in the Fort's National Register District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6193)|
| 1:43:20| 131 have been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| More than one out of every three nationally significant houses gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6203)|
| 1:43:34| I will close my argument with a brief anecdote from Knoxville's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| I'm in the process of restoring a condemned house on my block, also within the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| H1 expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| This house, the last personal residence of nationally recognized Victorian architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| George Barber and his wife, Laura, is an important part of Knoxville's cultural heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| Barber lived in four houses in Knoxville, all in Park Ridge, only two remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| His first house in Knoxville became dilapidated by the 1980s, but was restored to its former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| grandeur and stands in the current H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| His second house was lost, presumably to fire, over 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| A third became dilapidated and was raised prior to the creation of the current H1 overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Barber's final house was nearly lost as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| It had been vacant and condemned for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| The neighbors on either side were interviewed in separate newspaper articles during this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| period discussing how this blighted house was harming the neighborhood and contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| to crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Windows were smashed, weeds grew six feet tall in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| The house was finally given a repair or tear down order convincing the owner to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| Unfortunately, this was not before one set of the interviewed neighbors lost their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| to foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| The neighbors across the street lost their house to foreclosure as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| Architect George Barber is famous for his fanciful Victorian mansions, several of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| stand in the existing H1 areas of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| What is less well known is that towards the end of their lives, George and Laura Barber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| were poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| The Barber's died suddenly in 1915, leaving little behind save the small house they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| living in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| Court records from the settlement of their estate describe George, who expected his wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| to outlive him, deciding to move from their large Victorian house into a smaller and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| suitable house, the one I'm restoring today, smaller and more suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| Historic preservation is not something that should only benefit the wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| We as a city have the responsibility to hold up the stories of our working class citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| to preserve the homes of our mill workers and laborers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| With the H1 overlay, we have the opportunity to ensure that these smaller and more suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| houses continue to stand in our city's growing urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| Developers do not tear down houses to build less expensive houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| With the preservation of these smaller and more suitable houses lies the preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| of our neighborhood's affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| From those who are opposed, Brandy Slaybaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| Good evening, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| I'm Brandy Slaybaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| I live at 1618 Jefferson Avenue, which is in the current H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| When I bought my home, that overlay was in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| I sent emails to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| I hope y'all had a chance to open them and peek at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| I'm going to go through why I believe H1 overlay expansion is absolutely inappropriate in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| First of all, as you can see, most of the anti-H1ers seem to be over here, and most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| of the pros seem to be over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Prior to this beginning, we all sat together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| Greta's my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| These people are my friends, but we have been pitted against one another for a couple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| now about this opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| It has absolutely torn my neighborhood apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| A big part of that has been because there has been no consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| I contacted the University of Tennessee Municipal Technical Advisory Service, and I got a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6434)|
| 1:47:24| where, in 2008, they asked other cities, how many people do you need to request or petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6444)|
| 1:47:32| How many property owners in order for an H1 to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| Cookville, two-thirds majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Franklin, 50 percent have to request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| Nashville, 60 to 65 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Johnson City, significant majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| Kingsport, significant majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Clarksville, majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| If there's only one holdout, they just don't include the house in the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| Tullahoma and Jackson have 100 percent consent before they will impinge on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| rights of folks that live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| I called Jackson because 100 percent seems impossible to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| Elvis, who's in charge of this in Jackson, says, absolutely, and not only that, the onus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| of proving that 100 percent consent is on the people petitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| We're here today, and it seems like Ms. Trent is doing the defending of this particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| I don't think she's the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I think MPC is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| I think MPC has a duty to say, hey, we've got 40 percent against and 60 percent for, or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6511)|
| 1:48:39| Yes, there were public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Most people I know quit going because they were so contentious and so ugly, and they did not feel heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| I didn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| I'm in the H1 overlay already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I didn't want to get involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| But when I saw what it did to my neighborhood, I had to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| So now we are at a place where we don't know what the majority wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| Our neighborhood right now, I think we've got around 300 homes in the current overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| This expansion would triple it in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| At one point, MPC, Ms. Graybill communicated to me that they were willing to reduce the size of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| That sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| It sounds like a way to split the baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| That never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| Everybody's debated on how do we all benefit from what's going on, and the only way we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6562)|
| 1:49:30| and the only thing that seems to satisfy people is to say, hey, where's the majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| Where is the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| If you counted the people in this room today, everybody in this room, it still wouldn't be a majority if they all agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| We're looking at almost 1,000 properties in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| So that lack of even surveying, even saying, hey, property owners, we'll send out a letter and see what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6588)|
| 1:49:59| that is a failure on behalf of the MPC to find out whether there's even a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| I don't think Knoxville's a city where a minority gets to impose their will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| especially in private property rights issues, on a majority of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| Okay, the second thing I wanted to address is that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| You have one minute, Ms. Graybill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| Well, then what I'll speak to really, really quick is I believe in NC1, which has completely preserved Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6624)|
| 1:50:34| It's good enough for Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| It's good enough for the fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| We've got NC1s all over the place that are keeping what people are afraid of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| that we're going to have this really heavy people coming in, tearing everything down and rebuilding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| There are other neighborhoods that found this completely adequate while still allowing people to have the right to repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| and fix their homes in the way they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| So what I'm asking you is for you to send this back and say, hey, MPC, isn't NC1 appropriate for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| Sally Serafin, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6669)|
| 1:51:17| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| And pull the mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| Okay, I'm vertically challenged or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| I'm Dr. Sally Serafin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| I live at 2331 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| And I have been corresponding with all of you in some way, shape, or form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| as well as with the HCC and the MPC since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| Hopefully your records will show that I've already expressed opposition to the H1 expansion as a concerned neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| I started an online change.org petition against the H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| I closed the petition recently with 108 signatures in opposition to an expansion of the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6714)|
| 1:52:02| I have also corresponded with, in particular, the HCC and the MPC as the co-owner with my husband of 124-year-old George Barber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6722)|
| 1:52:13| with very unique masonry that I will refer to shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| Earlier today, I sent to you via email a reiteration of my opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6739)|
| 1:52:27| This time, you know, my training is actually as a primate behavioral neuroscientist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| But in keeping with the passionate objection that has developed in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| I have been doing some scholarly research looking at the history of discrimination resulting from zoning and land use practices across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6758)|
| 1:52:53| And it's troubling, so troubling that I feel as, you know, we sit in this room as though we are living in an alternate universe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6773)|
| 1:53:02| I hear discussion about, you know, the coming wave of more affluent people who want walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6782)|
| 1:53:11| They want, you know, historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| I, you know, share the grief for the loss of George Barber, the architect of my home, and I'm sorry for the fact that he died poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6794)|
| 1:53:25| But what I don't hear is any mention of the stakeholders, that is, the poor and brown people who make up the majority of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6805)|
| 1:53:33| It's not about the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| It's not about the flood that's coming from the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| It's about the people who live there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| So now I hope to impress upon you the need to consider socioeconomic factors and not merely the recommendations made by the HCC or the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6824)|
| 1:53:55| They are sausage makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| Their job is to make sausage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| Your job is to decide whether that sausage goes into a stew or a Subway sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| And what I hope you'll do is decide that the sausage makers did a great job making sausage, but it's not sausage we need right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6845)|
| 1:54:16| I want to draw your attention to something I cited in the email I sent to you earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| On August 21st, 2014, your communications director, Jesse Mae Sharkey, sitting here, sent out a press release entitled City Program Battles New Life into Blighted Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6863)|
| 1:54:39| The press release quoted the previous owners, the Washams of a Washington Avenue house, who recounted their labor of love and how the City of Knoxville's Blighted Property Redevelopment Program made it possible for them to restore that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6879)|
| 1:54:57| It also quoted the jubilant new neighbors, my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| I said, our family loves living in the house and this neighborhood, a diverse place that we can embrace and call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6902)|
| 1:55:12| What you should know from my petition and from my multiple emails to all of you is that my family is a multiethnic, multicultural family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6912)|
| 1:55:24| And we chose Park Ridge because it reflected the kind of community that we want our three children to be raised in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6924)|
| 1:55:33| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| I stand before you today to reiterate again that the H-1 expansion would reduce diversity in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6935)|
| 1:55:43| And there's data to support the fact that diversity is lost with the expansion of zoning programs such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6943)|
| 1:55:53| The H-1 expansion could harm low-income residents in the parcels of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| The parcels of land should not be prioritized over people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| The H-1 would increase the cost of homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| And here is where I bring things back to the press release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| That $177,000 that you gave the Washams to restore my house would not have bought enough bricks to restore the masonry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6968)|
| 1:56:19| Recently, in response to all this, I contacted Elgin Butler Superior Clay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| It would cost between $2,000 and $5,000 for a mold and $295 to $395 per brick in the event we needed our masonry replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6984)|
| 1:56:36| Let me wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| And our third speaker is Jimmy Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Jimmy Lee Duncan, Jr., 2421 Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| And I hope don't nobody shoot the place up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| Oh, I never had to give my address before I get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I am one of the guys who's been there for 43 years in the H-1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7031)|
| 1:57:21| I worked hard to fix my house, fix it like I wanted to, had to put foundations and all of that stuff under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7041)|
| 1:57:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| Bought a property next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| And I worked hard on it, got it finished almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7059)|
| 1:57:47| And then you come to this overlay stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| You can't do this and you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| Why can't you just let it stay like it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| Now, the people that's complaining about this and that, they don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| They wouldn't even let their dog be running through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| But I'm the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| I love there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| And we were doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| But I worked in one of these kind of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| I worked on a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Whatever I do, I do it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| A chimney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| Had to go get permission to do this and permission to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| And the man told me, he said, now, look at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| I had an old beat-up truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| He said, in a historical community, I trade you my wife and that house for this old truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7117)|
| 1:58:47| You don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| I am against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| Let me tell you what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| I don't know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| The people don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| We got the wrong kind of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Poor people, black people, white people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| They want them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| They can do whatever they want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| You still have that place with students in there and we'll be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7149)|
| 1:59:16| That's the historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| You know you don't have enough money to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| Everybody's not skilled at doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| Now, you imagine people, you've got to spend all of your money working hard, fixing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7163)|
| 1:59:32| and people decide that wouldn't live there, don't own a thing, and they're going to tell you how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7172)|
| 1:59:40| You all, ain't nobody in here would live in a place like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| But that's what they're imposing on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| They're going to tell you what to do, but you spend your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| Now, you know you wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| They'll tell you how to spend your money, but they wouldn't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| But to get us out of there, we got the wrong people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| They want us to go, and you can't fix your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| Now, when I was fixing on it, let me tell you what they did to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| I worked on that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| I was young, and now I'm old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| When I lived under the threat, I went on to where you get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| I had to sign a paper that they had the right to push it over any day, 365 days in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7223)|
| 2:00:34| and I had to do that for two years, and now here they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| They're talking about saving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| The city threatened me, and I had to live under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| And then when I get through, here they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| People harass me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| We want to sell the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| You want to sell your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| You want to buy your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Why don't they pay for their own house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| Go down Martin Luther King and fool with those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| They ain't going over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| They don't even want to be over at Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| They want to come over there and harass us poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| That's what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| They want you to spend your money, and they tell you how to spend it, when to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| You can't have this on your house, and you can't have that on your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| I know you've got building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| I know how to do it because I am in the building field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7283)|
| 2:01:29| I know, and I don't just work in black communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| I work down in Sequoia Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| That's well known where the money is, but you come over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| They want to take that and do whatever they want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| I'll let you all go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| You all are going to do what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| Thank you, Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| Those are all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7314)|
| 2:02:02| I'm sorry, what was your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| No, I said that is all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| We have to speak to this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| There's one speaker left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| One speaker left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Well, I'm wondering now as I sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| and I gather if there were 300 thereabouts existing homes and we're tripling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| it sounds like order of magnitude 600 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| I think I saw a number 550 or something, but that's the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| Why does the H1 overlay have to be so big is the question I have to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| In other words, why are we tripling what we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| There are various –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I'd ask you all to please not speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| There are various segments of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| Can this be done in bytes or phases or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| I mean, why don't we go where we think the threat is the largest for loss of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| and not incorporate it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| I mean, some of the speakers say, hey, we live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| We want to fix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| We want to make it livable, but let us do it our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| There's some merit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| I mean, this is their house, and they want to use their skills to fix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| Is there any lesser size of this overlay that we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| or some different overlay like that young lady said about an NC1 or some other version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| What does MPC say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| I mean, how do we answer that question that's been posed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7408)|
| 2:03:36| Good evening, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| There are 400 –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| Make your name, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| Kay Graviel with MPC, Historic Preservation Planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7421)|
| 2:03:48| The proposed boundaries follow the National Register Historic District boundaries fairly closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7428)|
| 2:03:55| so the area that is proposed for the H1 overlay is that that has already been determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7435)|
| 2:04:01| to be of historic significance by the National Park Service and the Tennessee Historical Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| The National Register boundaries continue all the way up to Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| north of Cherry, northeast of Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| So we, in surveying the area, felt like the area northeast of Cherry Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| had a bit of a change of character and was mostly later, more later construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| which could be possibly looked at in a later phase for a type of overlay if there's support for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7465)|
| 2:04:32| But the area that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| You're saying northeast, that's the other side of Cherry Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| North of Cherry Street up towards Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| The National Register continues up to there, so we left that part out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| So we, in a sense, are doing this in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| We had the core Washington-Jefferson avenues designated already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| so now we're taking in to the north and south, the National Register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| to align with National Register boundaries and taking in a few extra blocks where, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| the George Barber Houses that Greta Schmoyer owns and some of the other Park City High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7504)|
| 2:05:13| and some of the commercial buildings on Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| So we're taking in just a few blocks extra around the edges in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| where people have specifically asked to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| But generally the reason the district is the size that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| is because we're trying to take in all the area that's already been considered as historically significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7526)|
| 2:05:32| by the National Register nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| Does anyone have the right to opt out if they don't want to be within that boundary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| In other words, can you personally say, not my house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| It might be a question for the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| but it's not recommended that there be holes in a zoning district overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| so that you have sort of the spot zoning effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| You're saying it has to be contiguous somehow, the piece you're carving out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| It is much stronger as a district and more effective and does the job if it is contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| If you have people opting out, then you don't have the cohesiveness that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| to actually make the district work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| What about the assertion that some research shows, and the young lady was a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| I've forgotten her name now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| Sarah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| Sarah, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| She said there was evidence that such an overlay can end up discriminating against the blacks and the poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7584)|
| 2:06:32| who might be living there now and that that has happened elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| Have you looked into that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| I have researched that extensively and provided a memo to you all earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| I realize that came a little late for you, but I think a lot of folks are concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7602)|
| 2:06:50| We, as planners, are always concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| We always want to be aware of what can cause displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| I think people reading these studies interpret that if it's an historic area with historic architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| that that is one and the same as an H-1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| In some historic areas, yes, there's been great investment, renewed interest in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| so the property values go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| This started occurring back even in the 70s and 80s as people returned back to the city and started investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7635)|
| 2:07:24| These are historic areas in general that has happened in the larger cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7644)|
| 2:07:30| We have looked at—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| How about the ones in Knoxville, Mechanicsville, Fort McGill, and Old North?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| We have the demographics for Edgewood Park City that shows that the percentage of whites decreased by 11%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7656)|
| 2:07:45| in the existing historic district between 1990 and 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| It was established in 1997, so we had a decrease in whites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| There was an increase in African Americans by 13% after the designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| It dropped back to only about 2% increase by 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| It was an increase in African Americans nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| Other races increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| Nonwhite races increased by 7% between 1990 and 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| so we just don't have any evidence that that has occurred even in the Edgewood Park City district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7689)|
| 2:08:15| In the expansion area, the percent of whites decreased by 6% between 1990 and 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| African Americans also decreased by 2%, and this is in the area proposed for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| Other races increased by 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| So we don't have a great difference between the existing and the expansion area, the existing H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7710)|
| 2:08:39| We don't show an exodus of minorities from that area at least up until 2010 after it's designated in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7719)|
| 2:08:50| I realize this is complicated because the marketplace is raising the price of housing in the area closer to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7730)|
| 2:08:59| The downtown has improved, and people want to live closer to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| Economics drives pricing, and maybe that also drives who lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| But can you separate the two, or is it just the stats you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| It's almost impossible to look at all the different market factors that drive real estate prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| You have this location close to downtown, the amenities, the silots, the trees, the interesting architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| It's very difficult to discern the degree to which the H-1 overlay contributes to rising costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7765)|
| 2:09:33| But if we have, for instance, right now over the last six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| the maximum number of certificates of appropriate applications we've had are 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| Last year, before that, it was 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| So if we triple the 13 and say now if we have this expansion, we would have, say, 36 to 40 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7787)|
| 2:09:56| Out of the 522 parcels, the 40 or 50 applications out of 500 properties is not going to cause a huge property increase right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7796)|
| 2:10:10| In Forth and Gill, it took 40 years of price increases to get where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| So with the H-1 overlay, at least in Knoxville, it's been shown to be a very gradual increase in prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7815)|
| 2:10:23| That may happen to a certain degree anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| At least if people are investing, then this helps guide that investment to maximize retaining the character of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7827)|
| 2:10:37| so that we don't wind up with just a bunch of vinyl-wrapped boxes that aren't resellable or are not attractive to live among.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7837)|
| 2:10:49| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| It appears to me from where I sit, this is a very divisive situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| The community is divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| I appreciate the work of Knox Heritage and also the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| but it's obvious that you really do not have a majority of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7872)|
| 2:11:22| Some of the people don't even know this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| And also, I don't want to be a part of something that in the future will be something detrimental to this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7886)|
| 2:11:40| So therefore, I really just cannot support this overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7900)|
| 2:11:51| We don't know what the future's going to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| The historic overlays that we do presently have, with the exception of the Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7915)|
| 2:12:01| the demographics are different because you did not have a large African-American community in 4th and Gill nor in Old Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7921)|
| 2:12:13| So you've got a different set of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| So I just cannot support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| I will be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| And thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| I appreciate your view on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| I would like to ask Kay to come back up to the podium just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| Some mention has been made tonight about the difficulty of proceeding with whatever repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7958)|
| 2:12:43| And keep in mind, if an overlay comes into being in this area, it does not mean you have to update your property right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7963)|
| 2:12:52| That's just in the normal course of business as you choose to repair or replace or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| So, Micah, would you comment on the process with you and how it has changed with the new guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7978)|
| 2:13:10| I apologize about the lack of a PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| I do have one that explains all that in detail, but I realize that you're probably a bit short on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| So if you'd just rather me verbalize it, I can do that rather than use the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| I had put the two together, thinking we were going to talk about them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| and then I went and separated them back out again because they were two separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| So I'm sorry that's not currently available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8013)|
| 2:13:40| The way that the guidelines have changed are that we have reduced the number of items that even need a COA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8020)|
| 2:13:48| We have eliminated a review of the sides that you can't see from the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8028)|
| 2:13:54| We've eliminated a review of things like gutters and air conditioners and smaller items like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| We've made several of the items a Level 1 instead of a Level 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| Level 1 means that staff can approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| I'm sorry for the experience Ms. Riffey had several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| I don't recall it, but I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| She had that experience of not having someone to approve her 18 boards, but now one has the ability to email or call that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8055)|
| 2:14:22| They can pay over the phone with a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| They don't even have to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Since I've been here in the last six years, I've had people email the attachment to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| I email it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| They don't even have to get off work and come downtown at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| They do have to come down to get a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| That has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| It's the way it has been and the way it still is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| They still have to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| Many people just stop by an office, pick up the COA, and go upstairs to the next floor and get the building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| We've tried to make that as easy as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| Mainly, if there's concern about the George Barber houses and losing historic fabric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| we've said if there is historic fabric there, it needs to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| If someone is low income and can't afford to retain the historic fabric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| that is the program that Knox Heritage and the neighborhood are working on to provide gap funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| But if you have vinyl siding, if you have aluminum siding, if you have vinyl windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| if you had a board porch floor and it's not tongue and groove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| you can replace and keep the same material under these new guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| The philosophy is to do no further harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| If the original is already gone, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| Keep the material and replace with the same material because the original is already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| So do no further harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| The burden is not on you to upgrade the material from vinyl to wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8136)|
| 2:15:45| So those are some of the main changes that have been made in the design guidelines to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8145)|
| 2:15:51| We've cut the level one fee in half, which some people say is a drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| Others have said that it's onerous, so we reduce it from $50 to $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| We've reduced the items from level two review to level one review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| and we've eliminated review of what you can't see from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| Is there any more discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| OK, so we have a motion and a second to approve the 12 W, which is the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8178)|
| 2:16:27| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| We'll need a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| Councilman Brown? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| Councilman Campin? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| Councilman De La Vope? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| Vice Mayor Grieve? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| Councilwoman Palmer? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| Councilman Pavlis? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| Councilman Saunders? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| Councilman Starr? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| Councilman Wallace? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| The motion passes six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| Council, before we move on, we've been at this for over almost two and a half hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| so let's take a ten minute break, everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| There are bathrooms, there are restrooms right outside the store and down the stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8227)|
| 2:17:17| OK, so all of council is here so we can get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8237)|
| 2:17:25| Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| 12 F is an ordinance to amend Chapter 16 of the Knoxville City Code to add a new article entitled short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8246)|
| 2:17:32| to establish regulations for short-term rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| Council, before we get started on this, I do want to make sure that there are a couple people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8259)|
| 2:17:48| you know, at the beginning of the meeting we talked about who had signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| and I asked several people to get together to figure out who would represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| And then a couple other people have come up and asked to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| and I just want to let them know that it's too late to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| We already have the speakers, Jennifer Roach and Bennett Hirshhorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| OK, so you're too late on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| But the speakers for this when we get to that are Kathy Foster, Lynn Randazzo, Ann Langerdorfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8290)|
| 2:18:18| Then my understanding is those who were on the against side, Larry Silverstein, Sandy Gillespie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| and Phil Nordstrom are your representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| Is that all correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| I don't hear any objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8309)|
| 2:18:30| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| So to start, you read it and we got our motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| To start it off, as you begin what I suspect will be a lengthy discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8317)|
| 2:18:44| I would like to say a few things from the perspective of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| Like council, we have invested a lot of time and effort in this energy, in this effort on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8328)|
| 2:18:54| and we have been engaged both locally and at the state level trying to monitor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| In addition, Vice Mayor Grieve did ask if I would recap this process that we've all been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| So as we all heard during the past months and as we are probably going to hear again tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8345)|
| 2:19:12| there is a wide range of opinions on short-term rentals in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| This is one of those issues where I often say that good and reasonable people simply disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| I appreciate the time council members have taken to study the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| and all of the input we have received from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| and all these folks particularly in this audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| This may be the most vetted ordinance to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| Well, maybe aside from the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| We had to get that in one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| We began with public meetings and input last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| which shaped the proposed ordinance that was presented for public review and comment seven months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8384)|
| 2:19:50| City staff has been to the Neighborhood Advisory Council twice on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| We held two well-publicized and well-attended public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| and we met individually with a half a dozen or more neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| We also created a dedicated e-mail address for people to provide input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| and we received dozens and dozens of comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| City Council has also held three workshops, and this ordinance has been through MPC for review twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8410)|
| 2:20:19| This is the third time that it's on City Council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| So we have all studied, discussed, and debated STRs very thoroughly for more than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| We're all familiar with the full range of opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| from people who want short-term rentals with no restrictions at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| to people who want no short-term rentals at all, at least not anywhere near them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| and there's a lot of spots in between that people fall as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| But those are kind of the two main things we hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| I think it is fair to say that there is not a community consensus on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| and that's what makes it so difficult for you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| And that is why the proposed ordinance is a compromise between strongly different interests and points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8453)|
| 2:21:01| It provides for the operation of short-term rentals with rules and restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| specifically designed to protect neighborhood quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| It doesn't make everyone happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| It may not make anyone completely happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| And, by the way, we are not alone in facing this challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| We had a briefing last week at the Tennessee Municipal League board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| and this topic was on the agenda, STRs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| and the Nashville's vice mayor outlined the compromise that they are working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| with their short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| He said, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| And he meant that as an accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| That's kind of the irony of our work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| The reality is the issues and disagreements are not going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| no matter how many times we ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| And in the meantime, we have a growing market of short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| and we need a pragmatic way to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| We are the last of the four big cities in Tennessee to not have a short-term rental ordinance on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8517)|
| 2:22:04| Of course, that means we've had the benefit of watching and learning from their experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| and, frankly, from their mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| Now is the time to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| I fully support the ordinance we have presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| It has now been, as I said, through MPC for review twice at your request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| and they have recommended it for approval last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| And let me say something, especially to the neighborhood associations who are represented here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| One of my core principles as mayor has been the promotion of strong, safe neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| We have invested in many ways to protect and enhance the quality of life in our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| from sidewalks and parks to law enforcement, traffic calming, and neighborhood grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| If I or my staff believed in any way that this ordinance threatened neighborhood quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| I would not be proposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| And we all live in, all of us, the staff, myself, live in neighborhoods just like you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| and we will be similarly impacted by whatever decisions are made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| The reality is we have had hundreds of short-term rentals operating in neighborhoods across our city for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| with an estimated 30,000 stays by guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| And that's likely a conservative estimate, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| And we have seen virtually no impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| We have received only a handful of complaints or concerns in all of that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| and most of those have been about zoning violations, not any neighborhood disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| This is not because we have not been enforcing our laws, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| That is a talking point out there that is completely untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| We are enforcing those laws, those codes, exactly the same way we always have, by responding to complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| And there have been very few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| It is true that we didn't go looking to fine and shut down every Airbnb in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| We weren't getting complaints because they weren't creating obvious problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| and because we needed a more comprehensive way to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| We also knew from the experience of other cities that trying to enforce an outright prohibition is essentially impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8636)|
| 2:24:04| No city in the world has succeeded in doing that that we have found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| The proposed ordinance is fair, it protects our neighborhoods, and does not discriminate between or among them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8649)|
| 2:24:17| If anything, having these rules and permits in place will provide more information and protection to neighborhoods than exists right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8657)|
| 2:24:25| If we find, as the ordinance is implemented, that there are problems to address, we will move quickly to address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8665)|
| 2:24:32| and we will bring any proposed changes to council for approval that we find are necessary or that you recommend we bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| The structure of this ordinance will make that easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| The way we're structuring it legally will make that easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| In terms of enforcement of the ordinance, we have staff here, Peter's here, Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| who can answer any questions you might have, our legal staff is prepared as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| It is important to us that we create laws we can actually enforce, and that is our intention with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8696)|
| 2:25:03| So I know as we bring forward, as you all bring forward different amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| I'm going to ask staff, as I know you want to hear from them, what we think in terms of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| what our response is, and then when there are enforcement issues, then we will want to share our opinion on that with you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8712)|
| 2:25:19| So, of course, we'll be happy to answer any questions council might have as you proceed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| Now, also, council, so that's the end of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| We also have people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| Do you want to hear from them before you start addressing your amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| So now we go to the remarks from the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| Mayor Brown has –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| I'm sorry, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| Could I ask you, if you don't mind, to repeat something in your statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| I think I heard you say that no city in the world has been able to completely shut down –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8744)|
| 2:25:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| To totally shut down Airbnbs or the short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8757)|
| 2:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| You may try to, but you're not successful in actually shutting them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8762)|
| 2:26:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| And the demand only increases for them from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| Any questions of me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8771)|
| 2:26:12| So now the people who are going to speak, the way I understand, these are the people for the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| and that is Kathy Foster, Lynn Randazzo, and Anne Langerdorfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| If you would please come up in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| If you'd all please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| And I'll set the timer, and you'll each have up to five minutes, and we appreciate that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8789)|
| 2:26:38| We'll try to give you a notice when you're one minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| I'm Kathy Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| I live at 6721 Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| I think I'm probably going to be repeating myself, and you may be totally over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8808)|
| 2:26:54| but I'll try to go through it pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| First, I want to say that, in my personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| a short-term rental owner cares more about their home and their property and their city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8821)|
| 2:27:09| than a long-term rental property would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| They care about it because they live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| They're doing it because they love people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| They're doing it because they love teaching people about Knoxville, giving them an insight into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| I can't imagine anyone doing it and hoping to have conflict with a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| or looking for conflict with a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| You'd end up with bad reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| Then you wouldn't have guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| I sure don't want anybody to call the police to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| So that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| Starting an Airbnb has costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| I would say that I wouldn't want to do anything that would create property damage to my home, to my yard, to my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8869)|
| 2:28:00| Again, I'm saying I care about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| I love the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| I think most Airbnb hosts would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| I would also say that, as a host, you can get to know your neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8888)|
| 2:28:14| and your neighbors may have family and friends that they're looking for a place to stay in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8894)|
| 2:28:19| and then they can be right there with you, right there next door with their family and friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| and they know they've put them in a safe place, a comfortable place close to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| I would say that we would be keeping up with our sister cities like Asheville, Lexington, Louisville, Chattanooga, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8908)|
| 2:28:35| keeping up with progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| They are known for hosting music events, food, festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| I believe that Knoxville is becoming the same way with our downtown, with our waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8922)|
| 2:28:50| I would also say that other options that an Airbnb provides is if someone has to get out of their house in an emergency to fix something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8930)|
| 2:29:00| like water damage, it provides them a local place to stay in someone's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8940)|
| 2:29:06| If someone's planning a renovation to their home and they need to be out for two or three weeks to put in, say, hardwood floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| it gives them a home to stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| An important thing about Airbnbs is that you have a kitchen, and you have a living room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| and you have a separate bedroom, and you have a place to move around, you have a yard, you have a patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| I would say for parents of UT students, it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| It gives them somebody local that they can get to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| They bring their student far from home, leave them here at UT for four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| now they've got a local resident that they can get in touch with, they can get to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| they can come back and stay at their house when they come visit their student, their child that's at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8977)|
| 2:29:46| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| I would say that it's great for people that are here for medical treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| If they need a place to stay for medical treatment, it gives them a home to stay in, gives them a local resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8992)|
| 2:29:59| I would say nothing's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| It's a system that can be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| It's a system that, you know, you can iron it out, you can start out with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9005)|
| 2:30:10| and you can go through and figure out what's not working with it and then fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| I would say for neighborhoods that have narrow streets and they're worried about parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9013)|
| 2:30:18| that can be a requirement of an Airbnb host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| You have to provide parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| You can have a noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9024)|

| 2:30:26| You can say, you know, we're going to ask our guests to be quiet after 9 or 10 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9026)|
| 2:30:34| You can require Airbnb hosts to have their guests follow a noise ordinance for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9034)|

| 2:30:54| They'll say it's progressive and it's a way for them to own their own home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| because then they can rent out a portion of their home to help pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9057)|
| 2:31:02| It's a less expensive way to travel if you don't want to eat out every time you go out for a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| And I would ask you if you've ever stayed in someone else's beach house or mountain home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9067)|

| 2:31:24| I feel like I'm forgetting something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9084)|

| 2:31:39| Now, Lynn Randazzo, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| My name is Lynn Randazzo, 1800 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| First of all, I want to thank you all for a year ago forming a short-term rental committee to look into this and to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9107)|
| 2:31:54| I am a short-term rental owner and a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| Without the opportunity to rent our house, it is likely that I would have to step out of our business and take another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9117)|
| 2:32:04| This would stunt the growth of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| There are many other Airbnb hosts in the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171107?start=9126)|
