| 0:00:00| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention. I call to order this the September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=0)|
| 0:00:19| 2016 meeting of Knox County Commission. Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=19)|

| 0:00:48| As we're observing right now, there's a large contingent of young adults entering the room here with us tonight to observe County Commission. The organizational name, if I could use that, would be Youth Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=48)|
| 0:01:09| I know they've been in the small assembly room. Mayor Burchett had just finished addressing them. I didn't get the opportunity to hear what Mayor Burchett may have said. I need to balance that a little bit, I'm sure, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=69)|
| 0:01:30| The things that happen in public life sometimes start out with just being a member of the Boy Scouts or a youth basketball game team or church group, and it advances on into high school and after school, high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=90)|
| 0:01:55| A little bit of college usually is in line or a certificate program of some kind. Some of us had the opportunity to be selected by our friends and neighbors and serve with the military forces of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=115)|
| 0:02:14| You take up a profession. You have a family life. You proceed through life, and eventually at some point in time, you want to sit down and say, okay, I've done my 40 years, and it's time to retire and go do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=134)|
| 0:02:33| I should back up on that. I did not have a 40-year career with AT&T, but I am retired from AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=153)|
| 0:02:43| Where I'm headed to with this is that leadership takes place any period of time in your life, whether you be in high school, whether you be in the state legislature, whether you be a member like seated here, these are the members of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=163)|
| 0:03:03| It's all public service. You can find public service in lots of places, and I encourage you to do that. A lot has been given to us, and a lot is expected of us. Having said that, I'd like to recognize the leader that's here with you all tonight. That's Daryl Brady. Daryl, would you come forward and talk a little bit about your group, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=183)|
| 0:03:30| Yes, sir. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me say thank you to our county mayor, Tim Burchett, our chairman, Dave Wright, and each of you county commissioners for your willingness to serve. We are so thankful for the leadership you provide our county and our community, and it is a great opportunity to meet with you and learn more about your job and your day-to-day life as a county commissioner, so thank you for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=210)|
| 0:03:56| To tell you a little bit about youth leadership in Knoxville, all of these students are high school juniors. They applied, and from over 100 applications, they were selected. We have about 16 high schools represented, both public and private schools, and we have had homeschoolers in our class in the past as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=236)|
| 0:04:16| During the course of this year, these students have the opportunity to go through a summer camp, which they did in July, and they met from Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. During that time, they had the opportunity to do team-building exercises, they learned about local government, they learned about downtown Knoxville through a scavenger hunt, and then we went to Pellissippi State to learn about media and communication on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=256)|
| 0:04:44| On Thursday, they had the opportunity to go visit the Police Training Academy and learn about the evils of texting and driving, and each one of these students have had the opportunity to attempt to do that in a closed-course setting, and we all came away with very profound lessons that we don't ever want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=284)|
| 0:05:03| They also had the opportunity to tour East Tennessee Children's Hospital, and also we had a day focusing on arts and culture. They've also done community service. Each one of these students showed up on August the 6th at Caswell Park and worked the Shoes for Schools event from 8 a.m. to 12 noon as part of community service, giving back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=303)|
| 0:05:25| Now we begin a civic engagement arc of our curriculum, where they have the opportunity to visit first, County Commission, next month, City Council, and then after that, the School Board. Then in December, they'll have a session focusing on preparing for life after high school, whether that be vocational training or applying for college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=325)|
| 0:05:46| Then in January, we have a session on blended community or diversity and inclusion. February, they'll meet with some other key leaders in our community who are business people who offer inspiring words, and then we'll have the opportunity to tour the Manufacturing Demonstration Facility out at Oak Ridge National Lab, and then they will conclude with a graduation date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=346)|
| 0:06:07| So on behalf of our Board of Directors and our alumni of Leadership Knoxville, we are so thankful for this opportunity to come tonight and learn more about our county, and again, we thank you for your service and thank you for all you do for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=367)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you, Darrell. Just a second. My fellow commissioners, any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| Comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=388)|
| 0:06:50| Continuing with public forum, Ms. Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=410)|
| 0:07:00| Hello. My name is Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I'm the president of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners, and I'm here today to speak about the proposed appointment of Chris Uten to the NPC Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=426)|
| 0:07:19| I think it's the second item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| I want to say just first of all that I'm also here representing other community groups, including Community Forum, Fountain City Town Hall, Bearden Council, and the French Broad Preservation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=442)|
| 0:07:38| We learned only last Wednesday about the proposed appointment of Mr. Uten, and we don't have any reason to question his character or that he is, you know, a good member of the community or has a lot of abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=458)|
| 0:07:56| Our concern is that he does represent the building development community, has for many, many years, and that we feel there is not enough opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=476)|
| 0:08:10| has not been enough transparency or opportunity for community members who represent neighborhoods, who represent schools and average families to also perhaps be appointed to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=490)|
| 0:08:26| When the Community Forum learned last Wednesday about this proposed appointment, we got on the phone and started emailing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| and a number of folks have stepped forward and indicated that they would like to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| So we would actually just ask for 30 days to give Mayor Burchett the opportunity to see applications from a few other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=521)|
| 0:08:53| Sue Maurer, the president of Community Forum, has spoken with Mr. Burchett, with Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| and he expressed to her that his concern is that there have not been a lot of names in the hat to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=539)|
| 0:09:09| that it typically is developers who come forward and tell him, I would be willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| That's understandable because NPC commissioners are not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| It's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| It's a lot of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| It has to be a labor of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I think developers tend to be closer to NPC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| They tend to know when something's coming up, when there's a position that's going to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| The rest of the community doesn't necessarily, so we're just asking for a little more time to be able to give the opportunity for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=575)|
| 0:09:44| Some of these people who have indicated they would be willing to serve are Chuck Pilgrim, who is an architect and developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| He's actually in the development business himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| He is, however, self-employed, and he has worked extensively with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| I can say personally that I have spoken with him on any number of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| I think he'd be excellent, and I think that there are many builders in town, large developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| who also have a great deal of respect for him, so that's one other possible person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| Marlene Davis, the former dean of architecture at UT, former member of the downtown review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| She's been on many, many committees and is highly respected in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| Dr. John McCook, who is a recently retired head of special education services for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| and a longtime member of the community with many leadership roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| I would actually put my name in the hat, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| There might be people who would say, well, good, she won't be in front of us complaining anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| She'll be on the other side now and has to listen and consider both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| But there are a number of people who would be willing, and we would just like to have a little more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| so that there could be consideration of some of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| I think that would make this a more transparent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Again, I have spoken, worked with Mr. Aden many times in the past over developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| that have taken place in West Knoxville, and he's a fine person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| So we are not here to say there's any reason to oppose him as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Thank you, Ms. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Next at public forum, John McCook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=683)|
| 0:11:33| May I just say that I spoke with Mr. McCook, and I put his name on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| He said he might not be able to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| He is one of those people who is wanting to be considered, and I don't see him here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| so I don't think he's going to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Next in public forum, Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| My name is Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| Knoxville is the most racist city or town I ever visited or lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Your mayor is racist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Your governor is more racist than Alabama Governor George Wallace was in the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| I received this letter from the ACLU in Nashville telling me to put in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| my complaint to the city mayor, to the county mayor, to the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and to the city police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| I am waiting to hear from the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| The way I was treated on July 21st proved how racist the sheriff's officers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| And I ask for all your help to prove how racist you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| If this had happened to one of your family members, it would be front page news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| And this lady would be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| The lady cop that in Tulsa, Oklahoma, killed a black guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| had two domestic violence charges against her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| She failed two drug tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| How can we trust the police after a cop said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| I didn't come to a complete stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Then he changed the story in his report and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| I was over the white line in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| While he was hiding behind some trees to give me a ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| that $125 ticket, I paid it and was happy to pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| because I can get to come and complain to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| like I did to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| I will continue to bring this Muhammad Ali newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| to your meetings every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| just to show you how racist you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| It's sad that you all let your newspaper put this in print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| and want us to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I had Dan Grieve, he looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| he couldn't even find Muhammad Ali on this paper anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| He couldn't even find him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| That's how racist this old paper is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| And you all support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| The four years my wife served in the U.S. Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| was the best experience in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| We were treated better by the Germans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| than we are being treated here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Now, that guy Hugh Nostrom in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| he will not represent us better than Maureen Davis would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| And I'm very glad Sarah McKenzie is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| KUB is the biggest scam in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| and I will continue to voice my opinion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| Everyone in this room tonight, check your utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| How come our utility bill dropped $60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| this past billing cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| and it was the hottest month of the whole season?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| I'll never understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| and I will be at KUB board meeting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| We are also visited this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| by University of Tennessee journalism students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| young ladies, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Gentlemen, would you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| If you are here representing the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=898)|
| 0:15:08| I know it's probably an assignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| but you're here with a bright, shining face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| and I look forward to your being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| to spread the word of the activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| That concludes public forum today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| We have no honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| This evening's devotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| will be led by Commissioner Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| I generally like to start my devotions off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| with a leadership quote that I've recently received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| and I think it's very notable for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| A person who is worthy of being a leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| wants power not for himself, but in order to be of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=950)|

| 0:15:55| I think that's a very powerful statement for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=955)|

| 0:19:49| for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| because they have a prior engagement they need to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| is there anybody going to pull that off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=1193)|

| 0:20:20| which you would like to pull for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| And as you think of that for a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| there are only two items that are not on consent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=1226)|

| 0:44:54| Ma'am, name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| for the record please. Sarah Fantzler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| 37902| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Ms. Fantzler, did you get a lot of phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| and emails regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| NPC appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Yeah, we have gotten several emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| from the community regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| appointment. I don't have an exact number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| but more emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| than phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Would you guesstimate how many phone calls and how many emails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Maybe two phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| calls and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| 20 emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| I could be very wrong on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| A lot of more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| duplications of the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Okay, and they basically were saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| what? That they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| not in favor of Chris Uten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| being appointed. And that they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| the mayor to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Appoint someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Okay, thank you. Yeah, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| what we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| I have received a lot of phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| and hopefully you guys have seen some emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| and correspondence just saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| they feel like that the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| of the members on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| needs to be a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| balanced, not as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| from the building trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| construction, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| And so I think basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| from our forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| our public forum speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| asking that the mayor's office at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| delay this for 30 days to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| see if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| you know, other candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| that might be available for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Mayor, do you still want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| to stick with your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| Mr. Chairman, Tim Burchett, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| Mayor, 501 Princeton Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| 37919. Thank you, Mr. Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| Yes, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2808)|
| 0:46:56| I'll defer if anybody else has a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| I think this appointment pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| just swaps one type for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| so the balance that is existing there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| stays pretty much the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Would you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| That would be a true statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| one development representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| for another development representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| but I think what the community is trying to say is it's too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| one-sided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| In the last two years I've been on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| it appears to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| recommendations from the MP staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| commission, to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| change very little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| so I'm not sure that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| so out of balance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| we are having to correct things or have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| people calling us constantly trying to correct things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| Mr. Chairman, if I could make one correction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| it is not my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| recommendation, it is my appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| That's the way the state law reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| statement, Mr. Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| If Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Nystrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I too have received a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| and a couple of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| but I've also spoke with numerous folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| My take was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| especially after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| the mayor had said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| he definitely wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| put Krasutin in this seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| When I reviewed his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| background, I realized that he had actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| been an MPC staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| in his past history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| One of my thoughts were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| if we're going to get someone who's got kind of a real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| it's a very rare commodity and frankly I doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| I don't know the backgrounds of every current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| person serving on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| but if you're going to get someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| with a real estate and development background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| actually having someone who's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| worked on MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| seemed like a pretty good fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| if that's the industry you're going to be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| and even some of the folks who may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| opposed to him have also been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| have all agreed that he is a relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| civil person, a person that's civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| and easy to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| even if you might disagree on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| so that's been based on my very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| based on my research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| his candidacy to be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| to this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| I believe as spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| from the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| we're not questioning the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| of this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| and I believe that's the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| criteria that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| is this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| currently in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| or for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| notable reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| this appointment be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| and that's not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| presented in fact the opposite's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| this is a mayoral appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| and I would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| that we approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| or I will vote for it, let me say it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| I'll vote for it, seeing no further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| motion is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3013)|

| 0:54:47| 847 Knight Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3287)|

| 0:54:51| unless they opt otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| and have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| so how many of the fee offices have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| the law directors office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| I'm trying to remember if there's one other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| so there's only two offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| that this would not apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3310)|

| 0:55:14| but after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| if this is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| and done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3318)|

| 0:55:38| of the departments are going to develop their own now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| since this is an at will dismissal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3342)|

| 0:56:02| at will dismissal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3362)|

| 0:57:50| Mr. Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| I don't want to be out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| so these other plans that they come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| would they come back to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| no under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| ordinance they can opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| they will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| before commission as a spread of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| and will be filed at the clerks office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| so they will be publicly notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| the commission would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| that they've opted out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| the employees will know what the handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| that applies says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| just like the mayors bring his before his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| but they have continually codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| the mayors and that's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| before you now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| they have looked at some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| and the mayors and they brought it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| and the elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| have always been able to opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| ok so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| pardon me I'm just trying to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| so the elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| official of a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| can devise their own personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| and that person can do that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| that elected official has the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| to do that yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3534)|

| 0:59:42| on that's what I'm trying to find out where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3582)|

| 0:59:52| and it'll know that's what I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| to clarify to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| anyone that's on watching TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3596)|

| 1:00:18| or they are within this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| that you pass they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| have the option to opt out annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| if they so choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| they can opt in and opt out at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| they want to if they opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| they then prepare their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| it is filed with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| clerk's office and it is submitted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| county commission for spread of records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| at that point it would be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| commission library as part of the record of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| commission it would be in the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| as part of the clerk and the elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| official would keep copies on file available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| to their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| right now I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| that the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| elected official that is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| under the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| other than the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| is the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| I think all other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| elected officials have opted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| out under the prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| ordinance but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| that's the best I can recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| without having to look it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| putting a qualification on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| that's the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| and so just to make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| if a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| say register deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| they opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| or they don't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| and they're in it but come the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| first of the year of every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| year they can always change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| kind of like enrollment of your insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| where you have each year to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| enroll or correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Yes that's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3710)|

| 1:02:00| If a fee office opts out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| let's say they opt in first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| they opt in and an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3726)|

| 1:02:10| in this ordinance that directs them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| come what are their procedures to going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| through their human resource director to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3734)|

| 1:02:18| First of all they're automatically opted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| unless they opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| and as part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| if they have their own personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3744)|

| 1:02:32| they set that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| But if they opt in to ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| will they have to follow ours and come to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| human resource department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3758)|

| 1:03:04| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Commissioner Bradley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| So this policy does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| supersede the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| policies or fee office policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| so a fee office can set up a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| vacation policy of 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| vacation days a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| leader in that department is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| I don't know what's legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| how far they can go but yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| they can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| The sky's the limit that guy can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| whatever he wants to in his department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3812)|

| 1:03:36| within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| legal standards yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I think we've seen that prior to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| past election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| that some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| because if this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| policy for Knox County that we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| about it's only the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| for the mayor because everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| does their own thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| It's state law it's statutory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| it has a scheme set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| on how you adopt your own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| but the state sets a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| minimum standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| you have to have certain personnel policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| for all county and state employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| and this meets those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3852)|

| 1:04:52| with the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| the reason that this is brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| is not to discuss what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| held September the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3900)|

| 1:06:16| to begin a discussion about what dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3976)|

| 1:06:32| Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Mr. Chairman one thing that I might suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| that we add would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| something for new commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| as well as our currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| our older serving commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| would be for the Sheriff's Department to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| ride alongs as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| orientation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| that's the opportunity to actually ride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| part of a shift with one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Sheriff's Deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| it can be a good enhancement to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| orientation and that can be scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| outside of the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| so we need to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4023)|

| 1:07:13| to ride in the back seat I think the front seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| is full of electronics now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| I've never been in a back seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| that will be the first question they ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| at the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=4043)|

| 1:30:56| Yes, Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| This matter was postponed at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5460)|

| 1:31:10| The property is located on the northwest side of Ball Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| southwest of Zahn Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Point of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| I think it was denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| It was denied by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| It's here on appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| today from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| The Planning Commission recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| a denial I think for two reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| One, the staff recommendation was to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Mr. Davis at the time that he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| made the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| made it aware that he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| wanting to develop the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| 38 acre track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| but only asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| rezoning on the front 24 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| The staff took that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| and made a recommendation to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| primarily because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| back part of the property that he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| leaving out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| it rises in elevation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| approximately 300 feet over a course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| of about 700 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| which would be about a 40% slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| We felt that by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| rezoning the entire piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| One, it would eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| uses that could occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| back there without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| any potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| Secondarily, and what Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| typically does is develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| single family subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| and he could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| under the PR zone, he could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| those acres left over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| enhance the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| down in the flatter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| We felt that that would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| actually a positive thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| that he would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| been able to increase his density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| in the flatter part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| and wouldn't have to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| with working in the steepest portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| The minimum lot size in the RB zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| is 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| whereas there isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| a minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| or there is a decreased lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| So that was the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| played part in the Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| recommendation to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| and I think the other reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| that they denied it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Mr. Davis stood before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| board and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| and they obliged him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| They turned it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| so he's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| today on appeal for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| getting an action for which he asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| This turns out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| to be backwards I guess but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| Name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Yeah, Scott Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| PO Box 11315| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Knoxville, Tennessee 37939| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| First I want to congratulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| the new commissioners and thank you all for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| both the old and new commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| We appreciate your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| No intention on the old part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| but congratulations to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| and thank you for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Mr. Kelly is correct in several cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| but in one particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| I think I stated on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| that I had absolutely no intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| of ever attempting to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| the back portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| because it exceeds 20 something percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| which would be virtually impossible to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| and I believe I'm on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| and it should reflect that that I never ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| ever intended in any way shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| form or fashion to develop the back portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| In addition I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| not aware and am not aware that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| can take RB zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| density and apply it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| downward to the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| Can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| No, what we were saying is if you zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| the whole thing RB you can transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| the density off the side of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| to the PR part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| If it were all zoned PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| you could concentrate the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| in the flatter portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Okay, I'm still not aware of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| that you can transfer PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| and Mr. Law Director, you're a lot smarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| than I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| You may be more familiar with the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| clustering. I think that's what we've referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| that in the past where you can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| a steeper portion of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| property and cluster the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| down on a flatter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| But you're not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| to take RB zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| density and apply it to PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| You can't transfer those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| densities, so it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| That's not, as I'm aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| and you guys are a lot smarter than I am, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| you're not able to take density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| from RB and transfer it down to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| That's not permissible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| So that's an irrelevant statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| because it can't be done in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| Well, and all due respect to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| I, with a little bit of confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| here, I would like to have the opportunity to meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| MPC staff to make sure we're on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| So I would respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| a 30 day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| deferral if that's okay with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| some folks behind that may want to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| I don't know if they're here for that very reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| behind Scott. I'd like to hear from them as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| No problem, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| Your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| for the record, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Debbie Fox, and it's 3504| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Lobitty Road, Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| And I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| not so much an opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| but I have questions also as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| RB, PR development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| As far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| slope and the ridgeline, I know those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| there's a protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| of some sort on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| to have a copy or know how to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| a copy of that protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| plan, and then as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| as the 14 acres that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| are above the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| area that he's wanting to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| which would remain RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| above it, the 14 acres above it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| I would like to see those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| if possible, which would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| slope and ridgelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| undeveloped and left in their natural state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| and those acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| be rezoned accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| that is just my issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| the differentiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| If that upper portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| is not going to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| as he states, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| could it not be rezoned to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| agricultural or something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| natural, left in that state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| So that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| my only issue with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| And then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| in the last meeting I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| made regard to the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| and school impact on that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| I'm sure you're probably aware that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| currently three new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| within a one to two mile radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| under review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| There's two on Ball Road and there's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| just started on Ball Camp in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| Bakertown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| My main concern is the upper portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| the ridgeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| and the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| I request that it might not be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| and changed to that state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Ms. Fox, if you could stay up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Yes, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Ms. Fox, over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| I want to make sure I'm understanding you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| Currently it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| twelve units to an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| So the down zoning is preferable to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| as long as the disturbance is not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Because right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| somebody could move in apartments right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Exactly, I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| My preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| and I would prefer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| have that upper portion left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| in its natural state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| if he talks that he's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| do any development in the upper portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| I understood you, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Is that your light, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| You're leaning on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Dan, can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| I'm having your night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| R.B., Mr. Davis can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| what he wants to in R.B. now, can't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| He could develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| a detached single family subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| He could develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| apartments up to twelve units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| if he chose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| There is a mobile home park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| that has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| that was approved in 1975| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| that's legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| and can continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| He could do that under the current R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| I guess, Mr. Davis, you asked for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| but my question is why would you want to rezone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| when you can build what you want to build now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| That's a very good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| R.B. zoning is a bizarre zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| You can build apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| You can do all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| but to do single family detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| it has to be a minimum of 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| with pretty substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| side yard setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| So to do a traditional subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| which I normally do, you cannot do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| in the R.B. zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| It doesn't make any sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| I know you can have apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| you can have all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| but if you're going to do single family detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| it has to be a minimum of 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| with pretty substantial side yard setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| So that's why you've got to have the P.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| The P.R. enables you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| more design planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| and smaller lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| than the R.B. zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| permits with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| single family detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| Well, I know as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| an R.B. is the worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| zoning we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| You know, P.R. planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| is better, a whole lot better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Are you willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| rezone that back part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| to agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| Well, part of my problem with this whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| became when I came and applied for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| They wanted me to pay an extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| $1,000, $1,500 or whatever it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| to rezone the additional acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| that I knew I wasn't going to be able to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| just for MPC to be able to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| because of the slope and ridgetop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| I wasn't going to be able to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| So it made no rational sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| to pay MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| additional money for them to then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| turn around and tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| that I couldn't use this property anyways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| even though they required me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| rezone the whole property to then tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| that I can't use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| this has become a convoluted issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| with MPC because it comes up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| all the time where people rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| partially rezone a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| I've never seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| or been aware of the time in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| somebody took a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| and they wanted to rezone a portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| and MPC denied that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| They only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| wanted me to do it because unless I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| agreed to rezone the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| tract, they were not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| allow me to rezone part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| So again, I would like to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| with Dan and the folks at MPC and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| a chance to kind of go through this because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| a little bit confusing and see what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| in the best interest of all parties concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| and that the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| would enable me to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Well, I agree with the PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| I would rather see PR than RB any day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Davis, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| watched your video presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| and I too was a little perplexed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| when I saw what was going on because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| had made the statement about another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| fee that was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| charged and so I was a little confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| So let me just back up. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| had originally gone in and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| for the 38 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| that you wanted to have it zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| PR at 5 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| per acre, you would have paid one filing fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| That's correct, but it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| they charge on a per acre basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| so the more acreage you try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| rezoned, the more they charge you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Isn't that correct, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| That is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Okay. Now do you have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| option on the total 38| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| acres or just the 24? I have a contract to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| the entire tract, yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| It would have cost him approximately another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| $800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| For them to tell me I couldn't use the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| But then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| the dilemma is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| that other zone would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| intact for the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| You can't use it anyways, it's 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| something percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| It's unusable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| It'd be great for a hang gliding class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| You can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| physically get to that portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| So is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| $800 fee standing in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| of this kind of working out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| best way for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| That and also the principle of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| The principle that MPC is going to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| me that I have to rezone an entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| tract of land and if I don't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| they're going to hold me hostage and deny my zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| That shouldn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| and it should never happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Just because I wouldn't pay the extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| so they could require me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| to rezone the entire tract and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| come back and tell me, now you've paid this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| extra fee, $800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| Now we're going to go with the PR zoning and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| definitely tell you you can't do anything with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| property that you paid us additional money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| to have rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| It doesn't make any sense, there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| commonality or common sense that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| applied to that, but that's what MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| did, and that's what staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| and that shouldn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| Well I can see why Mr. Clancy made the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| From my 30 day psychological exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| Thank you sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Point of order, Mr. Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| If next month we come up here and the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| is heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| Can we rezone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| is in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Could my motion be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| hypothetically that we rezone the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| plot PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| and then somebody second that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| and then all fees are paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| and everything is taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| That particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| item has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| been submitted to the MPC for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| its review and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| It would need to go before MPC before it would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| It has to go all the way through that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| again for you all to have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| to do that, which again, if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| at state law, we'll agree to disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| on that, but commission should have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| authority and right to do, once it's gone before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| commission, before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| As I read state law, you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| should have the authority by which to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| But it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| opined by the legal counsel, which there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| a lot of smart people, that you can't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Mr. Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| his rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| was for the front 24 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| That's the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| that he made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| and that's the application that was before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| I don't know how this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| can deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| property that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| not before them by application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| unless you dictate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| start a general rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| If you watch the video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| that Mr. Green speaks at the very end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| he said the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| could initiate that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| But I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| that I want to set that precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| I find it ironic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| that we charge a guy to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| him he can't use their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Mr. Green is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| You can initiate a rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| I think you would have to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| for them to make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| and then come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| But the application would be in the name of the Knox County commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| I don't know that we need to get in that practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| I'm not in favor of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| I also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| I kind of agree Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| It is kind of ironic we're charging him money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| to tell him we can't use his land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| when he knows he can't use that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| I know it's not your policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| but I think it's an unnecessary use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| of resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| The example I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| and you can check my math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| If he got his own planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| at 5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| 24 acres would be 120 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| If he got 38 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| his own planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| at 5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| that would be 190 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| He would have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| then to transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| up to 70 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| down on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| I don't disagree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| but if you've been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| you'll see that those 70 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| won't fit on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| In all due respect that is incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| because of the slope and hilltop protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| they would reduce the density based on the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| and the usable acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| so they would reduce that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| based on the slope analysis done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| so no there would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| 5 times the total acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| I agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| I understand what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| but I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| we could have worked through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| instead of having this circus that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| for 30 days on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| Thank you Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Dan I believe asked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| exact question I wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| is if we as commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| could submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| but I don't think Brad wants to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| for presidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Have we never done that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| The commission has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| filed a general reserve request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| I don't know that they've done it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| either benefit or hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| they have done it to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| bring areas into conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| and it's typically larger areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| rather than one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| Could that not be justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| as bringing that into conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| with that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| getting rid of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| The plan designates that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| for low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| It's certainly not a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| that would typically be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| would not be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| in the low density residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| But that would be a precedent for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| because to my knowledge the commission has never initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| that on an individual's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| if I'm aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Especially since that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| is not here it's just the guy on the contract on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| So it makes me a little leery of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| But I can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| Mr. Davis' dilemma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| You don't want to pay for something you're not going to get to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| and even if you can transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| those units down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| it probably doesn't fit the plan that he has for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| And if you take the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| at 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| and the total at 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| even with the remaining portion at the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| you're still going to have less than what you have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| Seeing no further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| I'd like to make a motion we postpone to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| Was there going to be a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Mr. Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| I was just going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| that Mr. Davis' request is before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| He's asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| PR at 5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| on the front 24 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| and you can certainly deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| if that's your choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| he's talking about the hillside plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| and again the hillside plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| is a guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| and the staff will make a recommendation based on that guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| The 24 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| that he has before you at 5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| a portion of it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| in the hillside area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| and will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| have some impact on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| we would recommend that the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| be laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| but the request is before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| if you want to act on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| feel free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| Did we get a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| No we do not have a motion yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| I made a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| and I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| Mr. Busler seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| recognize Mr. Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| at the moment the motion was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| Mr. Kelly would not have been speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| if the motion was before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| Are we ready to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| We are now to the point of making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| Postpone 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| so the MPC and the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| can try to work through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| The motion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| properly before us on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6714)|

| 1:52:02| postpone until the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6722)|

| 1:52:06| zoning board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6726)|

| 1:52:12| All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160926?start=6732)|
