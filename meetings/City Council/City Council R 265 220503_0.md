| 0:14:21| using it. The principal from the school around the corner, this is a really important connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| because it addresses some of the parent responsibility zones. It's one of the places that we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| lacking some sidewalks. We say that kids have to be able to walk to school and there's parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=873)|

| 0:14:58| school, but they were out playing on the sidewalk and in their front yards. So it was great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| to see the community out there using it and getting to school that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=902)|

| 0:18:36| Yeah, I was wondering if Chad West was here to answer a question. So I'll start my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| when you're on your way. I'm just curious how many sites, I know this is for the dumpsters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| and roll-offs for recycling collection and waste throughout the city. How many sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| are served by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Yes, Chad West, City Public Service Director. There's around 50, give or take not counting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| our five drop-off centers. So you think of ball fields and recreation centers that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| know, our cart system doesn't necessarily work for the bigger locations. So it's mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| those locations that have dumpster service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Okay, and then there's five recycling centers with locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| So one thing that constituents have asked for is recycling locations near them. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| are the constraints to have additional sites for roll-offs for recycling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Well, most of our five drop-off centers are all managed by Goodwill Industries as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| and some of them, they actually own the property. Only two of the locations are actually city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| properties. So the biggest constraint is really property where people want a drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| center in their parking lot or their facility. We just recently moved one to, like, the Pleasant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Ridge area, which is actually on a Goodwill site. So that's one of the bigger constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| The other one is just the transportation cost of collecting it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Okay, because one area of town that asked for a closer site was Fountain City, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| think the past problem has been locating a site in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| That's correct. The biggest issue has been locating. A while back, we had it at the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Kroger that used to be on Broadway, but when that closed, we lost that site. Having patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| McKenzie, our team's always looking for other locations, but the biggest issue in Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| City is just the site, to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Okay. My last question is tangential. When is the contract for household collection up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| for renewal? Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| So if I remember correctly, the first one was seven years, and it went through in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1230)|

| 0:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1236)|

| 0:20:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| I got you. Are the options for renewal voted on at Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Typically not, unless there's a reason why we want to go back out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1251)|

| 0:21:19| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1279)|

| 0:21:32| And I have one other person signed up. Oh, two other. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1292)|

| 0:21:42| All right. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Good evening. My name is Larry McAfee. I live at 3333 Clifford Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| All right. Madam Mayor, Vice Mayor, Roberto, members of Council, I'm here today to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1309)|
| 0:21:57| in favor of Item 12A and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| I'm Larry McAfee, the president of Knoxville Firefighter Association, and also the employee rep for the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1322)|
| 0:22:12| I'd like to paint a little picture for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| So, during COVID, no station was browned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| Every day, the men and women of Knoxville Fire Department showed up to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Rain or shine, snow, they showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| We had the back of the citizens, and so we're asking you as council to have our back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1351)|
| 0:22:39| When I applied to join the Knoxville Fire Department, there were several thousand applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| Now, we'd be good if we get a few hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| You may say, why? Well, I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| It's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| So, we need you to support the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| She proposed a gap pay to help with retention, to keep people on through at least June of this year, June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1382)|
| 0:23:12| So, I ask you to support that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Next person signed up to speak to this item is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Ms. Cook, if you could come to the podium, you have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| My name is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I live at 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| For 17 years, I was employed by Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I began in the finance department and was appointed by Tommy Shumpert early in his first term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| to be a leader on the team to implement performance measures in Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| With the help of and membership in the International City-County Management Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| we successfully implemented performance measures that are in place still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| The methodology was adopted by the United Way of Greater Knoxville for use by those who receive United Way grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1450)|
| 0:24:19| Prior to my coming to Knoxville, I was a business systems slash financial analyst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| in a variety of private and publicly held corporations over a period of 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| All of this is presented to you to assure you I know of what I speak on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| The objections that I will voice to you this evening are primarily due to the lack of sufficient evidence being presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| that distributing mountains of money will solve some supposed personnel problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| being experienced with Knoxville City General Government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| I want to be perfectly clear up front that I don't contest the need to improve the status of uniformed officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| and I wholeheartedly endorse the concept of a livable minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| I do, however, strongly object to the idea that paying employees a $2,000 retention bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1515)|
| 0:25:23| is going to make a difference in whether they remain with the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| I saw nothing in the presentation nor anything in the classification and compensation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| that suggested Knoxville was losing their general government employees at any faster rate than any other municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| It was not an employee retention study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| Is there anyone who believes that $2,000 is going to be the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| as to whether someone considering leaving their job is going to stay or go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| probably just stay long enough to collect the $2,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| You can't buy loyalty and you'd probably be better off without a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| that a payment like that would make a difference to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Aside from the fact that it pertains to funds in the current budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| I don't understand why this ordinance amendment is first on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| since it's included in agenda item 12D, amending the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| It seems like the cart is before the horse here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| Please don't approve the expenditure of nearly $3 million without a detailed retention analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1595)|
| 0:26:44| that would at the very least suggest that there is a retention problem in the general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| that is greater than what is being experienced nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| Remove that portion of the ordinance amendment that pertains to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| and move forward on the funds transferred to Knoxville CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| You can always go back after you've reviewed item 12D and submit this as a standalone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| That is, if you still believe it will make a hill of beans difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Next person to sign up to speak to this is Investigator Jason Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Mr. Booker, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Jason Booker, 800 Howard Baker Jr. Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| KPD officers provide a valuable service to the city in answering over 300,000 calls of service per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| Those numbers do not include the thousands of interactions every year our officers have with citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| that are not documented as an official call for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Citizens and officers deserve the best services available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| and this budget proposal would ensure hiring quality applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| and retaining quality already highly trained officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| KPD currently has an authorized strength of 416 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| As of today, we have 364 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| That's 52 under our authorized strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Nearly 90 officers are eligible to retire within the next 23 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| Nearly 50 are eligible to retire today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| They don't have to come back tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| In the last two years, we've only graduated 77 new officers from the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| That includes 61 traditional recruits and 16 lateral hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| In the last two years, we've had 84 officers leave KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| 25 have retired, 57 have resigned, and two have medically retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| This budget is an investment in the city's most important assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| and those are the people who keep the city safe and keep it running on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| This budget proposal is not only about police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| It will affect and benefit every single city employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Council members, that is all the people who signed up to speak on 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| I have just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I'm definitely in support of paying people what they deserve to get paid and retaining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| My concerns are about the part-time employees not being included in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| and also those that are making over $100,000 being included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| when there may not be a compensation issue at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| And it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| There are about the same amount of part-time employees as there are employees making over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1777)|
| 0:29:46| I just want to bring that point up, and if that was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| Mr. Bates, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Let's talk about part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Parks and Recreation, you're right, has a good number of individuals that are lifeguards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| that are working very part-time hours at our recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| They were not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| That cost was about $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| All of the permanent part-time individuals, and there's a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| I think there's about six in Parks and Rec, are included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| If you look at the individuals, and I've got the numbers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| there's about 28 people that make over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| So out of the nearly $3 million in retention supplements that are proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| about $56,000 of that are for people making more than $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| The mayor, elected officials, cabinet members are not included in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| specifically excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| I would say, just because operations has individuals in information systems mainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| a lot of those folks are in IT, those individuals are very sought after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| and there is a potential for them to leave, even though they make over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Again, for the retention bonus, that cost is about $56,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| and I would argue that those are individuals that can be picked away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| and can leave and can go other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| So the decision to not include the part-time employees was a financial decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| I think the mayor asked us to bring a budget that you have all seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| and that she laid out at the St. Mary's campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| and there were very hard decisions made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| One of those decisions was right now we're going to focus on the core services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| and that we'll look at that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| but that $700,000 is not included in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| and again, that was part of trying to sharpen the pencil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| and make sure that we can present something to council that we can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| I think all of this is beyond what we can afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| and we're going to be working on that with property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| So to me it seems like that's a point where we should not have sharpened our pencils perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| We need to take care of the part-time employees as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| and I think that is going to be the same issue with the next item on the compensation adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1917)|
| 0:32:06| The part-time employees, will they be included in the raising to $15 an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| Those individuals were not included in the compensation plan, but Dr. Drummond is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| I think we also need to remember that these are officials at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| these are oftentimes people that are working as a lifeguard during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| You know, my son works as a lifeguard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| so this is someone that may work a few hours during the summer at our pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| These are individuals that are officials at our basketball games or softball games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| so oftentimes this is a secondary or tertiary job that someone has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| and so we felt like the impact of a full-time job or a full-time part-time was very, very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| and we did not include those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Some of those individuals, there's a range, depending on experience and what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| between $9 and upwards of $15 plus, but it depends on the job and it depends on the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| So the reason I'm raising these concerns is I've had a few part-time people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| employees reach out to me and they had questions and they were disappointed about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| I understand. I think we focused on those core services, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| people who full-time job at the city every day, not perhaps a secondary or tertiary job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| Not that we're not sensitive to that, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| we did have to make obviously difficult choices in budgeting. It's not always easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Thank you. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| This body's voted a number of times to give, I think, different types of bonuses or incentives to city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| so I know that this body feels strongly about rewarding its employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| but I don't remember doing, kind of making an amendment at the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| but as a refresher, what bonus or incentive pay has this body given to city employees over the past two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| Ms. Juneau, could you give us a reminder of the various bonuses that have gone out, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| Yes. Councilman Smith, May of 2020, $364,395 went to sworn employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2037)|
| 0:34:07| Could you speak closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Sorry. $364,395 in May of 2020 was a sworn employee bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| That was the $500 hero pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| December of 2020, a total of $730,674 went to sworn and general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2060)|
| 0:34:30| That was a $500 COVID bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| In November of 2021, $2,780,277 was an ARPA bonus based on employees that were both sworn and general government meeting ARPA qualifications for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2073)|
| 0:34:51| The total for all three of those bonuses was $3,875,346.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| I remember from maybe somebody that could speak to the compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2103)|
| 0:35:12| Well, Dr. Drummond is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| I meant to email you this before so you could come prepared, so if you don't have the answer, fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| I remember from the compensation study that the retention rates were different by pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| I think you lose certain types of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| You lose less employees as the pay scale goes up, typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| But I also realize that there are some higher paid members of the city staff that are sought after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| The market is competitive right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| So this is currently a retention bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| That's the kind of ask here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| So could you talk about the turnover rates in general government and in sworn employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| Any differences in pay grades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| I will be able to answer a little bit of that, but I am not prepared to answer all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| So I'll get all of the information back to you and get turnover rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| We do look at turnover rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| As we've talked about, uniformed bodies, police has the highest turnover rate that we have currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| And he's already mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| When we look at general government, our general government turnover rates are the highest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| are going to be in finance and IT, public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| We're going to have issues in fleet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| Those are going to be your highest turnover rates in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| Council Member Smith, if I could just expand on that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I think finance is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| They've been down seven or eight employees over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| And so all the employees out of a total of 27?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| 41 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| 41 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| But that's about 17% of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| So that also means that the remaining employees are picking up the slack for all the people that are not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| who left for other high-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| And so that's just an anecdotal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| one story of one department of all the extra work that our employees are doing due to the staffing shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I just want to make sure everybody in the public knows that this decision is about this current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| not the recommended tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Speak into the mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| This ordinance is about this year's budget, not next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I'll let some of my colleagues ask some more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Director Janot, just so we make sure that everyone understands what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| Item 12A is moving money into accounts, which will allow the payout of bonuses to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| And there are other things as well, but we're talking about moving money, not spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| This is an amendment to move money around that will authorize us to be able to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| And so that's why this item is coming up first, and then later we're going to vote on spending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| So I'm in absolute agreement that we need to recognize the hard work of our city employees and what they do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| You know, the thing that I'm thinking on this one is rather than a one-time bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| I think these funds would be better used to address the shortcomings in the current longevity pay structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| and that would be a better approach here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| I'm going to vote yes here because I think we do need to move these funds so that we can spend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| But I do think there were better ways to accomplish the goal of retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Yeah, this is a question for maybe Dr. Drummond or maybe Susan Janot, maybe Dr. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| So I'll get started while you're walking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Dr. Drummond, this agenda item is being referred to as retention bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| What I recall, which may be flawed, what I recall from the workshop for the compensation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| was that we couldn't institute the pay increases recommended from the compensation study until the new budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2354)|
| 0:39:25| and that this pay was to institute the new pay sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| It was like a bridge to bridge the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Instead of, hey, everybody, we recognize for viewers at home, I think it's important to know there's a lot of city employees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| Those city employees who have been recognized in the compensation study as being underpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| we can't start those increased jumped-up salaries until July 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| and that this line item and this proposed amount out of the fund balance is to bridge that gap for what are we in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2394)|
| 0:40:04| We're in May already, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| So to kind of bridge the gap from May and June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Am I remembering correctly how that was explained to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Yes, ma'am, if you'll allow me to explain it just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| When we look at this, the study was a classification and compensation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| to look at how to recruit and retain employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| So it was not just a recruitment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| The study was to look at that, and as MAG continued to work on the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| their recommendation was to have a stop gap because you're having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| it is not that we were losing faster than the rate of any other university, any other system, any other employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2438)|
| 0:40:48| but we're losing at the same rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| which was causing a problem because as we were losing employees in some of these fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| we could not bring them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| The cost of turnover, the time it takes to refill someone is a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| The time of turnover is very, very significant, and we can get you that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| So you look at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| So MAG made the recommendation that we could implement a retention bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| a one-time bonus that would be paid out during this current fiscal year that would allow us to compensate employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| and encourage these individuals during this first half of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| We brought this before everyone's attention early in the year with the hope of keeping individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| not losing as many individuals, and stopping that bleed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| So by doing that and repaying this out now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| it gives you the hope and the ability to be able to stay with the understanding that on January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| excuse me, on July 1, you will have the additional compensation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| So it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I don't want to call it a stop gap, but it is done to help to fill in that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| So I'm going to call it a bridge versus retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| If that's a more fair way of understanding it mentally, that it's not a retention bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| it's a bridge to get us to the new salaries that we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Slightly later down the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Councilwoman Roderick, I would just add, I agree with that bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| but I would also say it's a recognition that these gaps and shortcomings in where our employees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| versus where their peers are is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| It's been this way for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| And this relatively small $2,000 payment is a small recognition that we're fixing it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| but it's been decades that it's been this gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| And so this is just a gesture to show that this multiple decades of gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| we've noticed that and we're fixing it, and this is something to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| Well, so I just want to tack on to that and say, and that is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| and I acknowledge that, is why we did the additional pay May 2020, December 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| and the additional $2 million November 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| This is an employee market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| That's one of the issues that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| There's a lot of people that are choosing to stay home with their children, with their family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| People have reset their mindset on employment and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| But, you know, it costs us a lot of money to have turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| and we need to avoid that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| And the other thing I will say in terms of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| which I know we're not quite to those agenda items, is the bulk of most employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| specifically the city, is this is a service provider, and the bulk of the budget is the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2624)|
| 0:43:53| So that's where we spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| Thank you, Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Dr. Drummond, I'm sorry you sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| So can you just sit closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| You're getting your steps in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| So just another little point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| If we're talking about this retention gap, bridge, whatever word we're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| I think one of the things we need to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| and I just want you to confirm whether I'm right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| is that when we lose people, and we have lost people, not only is it time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| but I assume the classification and compensation structure we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| does not adequately allow us to hire new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| because it is so far below what the market will pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| That is absolutely correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| and that is why we're going to get hopefully to 12D here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| and we will be able to make the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Yes, that we will make the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| As the study found that we are significantly underpaid in several positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| As that occurs, it makes it more difficult to fill positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| and I'm not just talking about uniform government, uniform body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| We've talked about them, but I'm talking about general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| When we think about your public service workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| we think about some of those, your IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| At this point in time, it has been very, very difficult, also in fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| It has taken months and months to fill a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| So when you put that in, you think about the cost of the individuals having to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| the cost of trying to find someone who only takes a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| and then they say, I can go make a few more dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| and a few more dollars will drive people out in this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| So you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| I also think another thing we need to think about as a person who sits on the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| is that we look at total compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| and we don't have a defined pension plan for new employees at all anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| The city changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| That used to be a big retention piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| A defined benefit pension was traditional in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| and that was a big retention thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Basically now we hire employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and they have the same kind of retirement plan that I had at the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| which was a 401K sort of government, not government-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| Is that correct as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| I'm not going to speak totally on that, but you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| But in terms of packaging for total compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Because we don't hire people just on salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| It is the benefits, it is the entire package that we have to recruit with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| because that's what the rest of the world recruits with too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| We have a wonderful, and the study talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| there are some things that we need to adjust in our benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| but overall we have a good benefit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| As you talk about the pension, it is a 10-year vesting in the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| So as you think about that, all of those things play into long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| and longevity retention and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| And I do know Uniform Services don't like that we changed the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| but financially for the city we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| In terms to keep our pension solvent and fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| I just wanted to make the point that all of it goes into the hiring and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| I have similar concerns that I've expressed previously about needing more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2868)|
| 0:48:01| about how effective these types of incentives have been in the past at retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2881)|
| 0:48:13| and recruitment because we have been investing money into this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| Before I was elected, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| but one of my first city council meetings was investing into the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| and recruitment of our KPD officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| and we just aren't seeing those investments result in good results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| And I've been pushing for us to really focus on some internal changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| that could strengthen our recruitment and retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| and I feel like we've done nothing in that realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| And so I'm struggling with whether to support this item or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| You know, when it comes to the budget, you all should know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| The mayor sets the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Whether city council votes for it or not, the mayor gets the budget that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| According to the charter, I would like to bring a process forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| where we change our budgeting process in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| but regardless of how we vote on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| the budget passes June 15th and the mayor gets whatever budget she wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| This item, this bonus, is a bit separate because it's amending the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| and so if it didn't have a majority of votes, then this item could fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| It does not sound like this item will fail tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| but I am concerned that there are individuals at the higher income levels included in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| that don't necessarily need it or is in a position where we don't have an issue with retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=2994)|
| 0:50:05| I'm concerned about those at the lower level who are working part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| I've heard of several staff with the city who are working part-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| in hopes of that position becoming full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| These are not just folks who are making $100,000 during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| and practically volunteering at night to help out the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| And I'm worried that this thought was not put into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| But again, the budget's going to pass, so y'all are getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3035)|
| 0:50:43| I had a question about the redevelopment project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| I was looking back through the October 19th agenda from 2019-2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| where it said council had already approved that item, and I could not find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| Did anyone remind me of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Ms. Welch or Ms. Juneau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Yes, I'd be happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| That was part of the budget amendment that was approved at that October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| Okay, perfect. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| And so that's another issue for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| There are items packaged together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| So even if I want y'all to get a bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| there are other items packaged in there that I don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| And so when I vote no, please know I support y'all getting a bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| but there are other items, this politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| other items packaged in there that I cannot support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| I just have a quick question for Director Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Is the $2,000, is it pre-tax or post-tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| That would be pre-tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| It's a gross $2,000 amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| I definitely know we're in a competitive market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| I plan to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| but I do think that there's going to be a direct impact between this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| and the amount of money we're able to approve or not approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| as part of next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| So I do think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| there are some informed folks in this room who know I've been advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| for a raise for a couple years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| and I think that's probably going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| If you could get a little closer to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| With that said, I do have a question for Director Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Any unused general fund dollars for the year go into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3140)|
| 0:52:28| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| So there was we don't have to spend the dollars that are appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| for the budget by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| This is an intentional amendment to prioritize these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| and fund them, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| It's not a trick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| I'm trying to make sure I understand what I'm following a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| So I just want to clarify that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| I think you mentioned earlier we've spent almost $7 million of pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| to sworn and general, excuse me, including this 2.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| We will have spent over almost $7 million over the past couple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| in employee rewards, incentives, bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| and that's a significant investment that this body's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| And I just want to clarify for the public that that's almost 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| of the recommended $17 million as part of next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| So we will have committed almost 40% of that one-year dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| over the past two years if we approve this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| So I just want to call out that that's a significant investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| in the people in the city, the employees who showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| who continue to show up, and this body's shown up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| And I agree with Vice Mayor's comment that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| I'd rather see this money roll over into next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| for additional long-term pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I think that's a better use of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| We don't have to spend these dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| but I plan to support this nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| I just think it's going to have a direct impact on next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| because every dollar we don't spend this year we can spend next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| So I'm happy to reward these folks with this incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| I'm not really convinced that two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| this is going to keep a lot of folks from quitting for the next two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| until we get a new budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| I'm not convinced of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| The data that I reviewed after the compensation study suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| that the higher income, obviously the lower turnover we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| and so I just don't think this is necessarily going to be a stopgap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| With that said, I am going to support it because I think it's good to reward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| the hardworking folks that we've been rewarding for the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| 12B is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| for the several departments, agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| and funds of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| 2022 and ending June 30, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| and providing the authority to reappropriate non-project related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| encumbrances at the end of fiscal year 21-22 into fiscal year 22-23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Motion made to approve and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| I think there may be someone signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| We have a couple of people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| First is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Mr. Roach, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3337)|
| 0:55:50| Mr. Roach, if you could start by stating your name and address for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| My question has to do with process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| I'm not more confused after listening to some of this this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| but I think you owe the citizens of Knoxville a more in-depth explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| of what the heck is going on with our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| because you've got police and law enforcement people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| city employees here who want to get a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| But what they really need is a thorough commitment down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| to be compensated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Okay, I know that may sound strange coming from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| but that's the truth of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| And until you guys decide that you all want to do this and pass a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| I know what Ms. Parker said about you, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| controlling the budget and getting what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| I don't know what you guys can say to her to change her mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| I don't know what kind of input you guys really are having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| I've heard several council members say that it's better to go along with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| It's not good to anger the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| And, yeah, that adds to the lack of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3443)|
| 0:57:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| That's what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| That's what I've had to say, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| The other thing is, how many auditors does the city have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| Per department, for the city, how many auditors does the city have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3466)|
| 0:57:53| Can anyone give me that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Mr. Rocha, this is an opportunity for us to listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| It's not a back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| So there might be discussion among council after your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| It would be nice to have an idea of how many auditors there are for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| I don't think there are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Maybe one, two full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Probably need about 15 to 20 because of the mix of income that this city has from the federal and state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3493)|
| 0:58:21| and local taxes raised plus the private dollars that come in that are utilized by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| We need to have some assurance that those funds are properly used because we've got too much stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| We've got too many people out here not being tended to for there to be a waste of any dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Next person signed up to speak to this item is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3528)|
| 0:58:56| I'm still Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| I still live on Chinquapin Lane in Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| Once again, I think the order of presentation of this ordinance is out of sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| It assumes too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| It is difficult to imagine that the city council must be a rubber stamp for whatever the mayor submits as a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3552)|
| 0:59:22| The supportive arguments for this budget are all presented in a complex, convoluted ordinance that will revise the existing classification and compensation plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3562)|
| 0:59:35| based on recommendations from an outside consultant without consideration for the city of Knoxville's unique and cherished environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3575)|
| 0:59:47| We have a cost of living that is 11.6% below the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| It presumes the council will buy into the argument that Knoxville general government employees are generally dissatisfied with their salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3595)|
| 1:00:06| and will only be better off if they are compensated at 100% of the rate of their peers in other municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3606)|
| 1:00:16| As presented in agenda item 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| An opportunity to do a detailed staffing analysis to determine levels of staffing required based on optimum levels of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3620)|
| 1:00:32| was passed up when it was decided to just take the recommendations of the consultant relative to salaries and run with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3632)|
| 1:00:43| As a city taxpayer and homeowner, I depend heavily on the brush and leaf pickup crews to keep my and my neighbor's property meeting codes and looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3643)|
| 1:00:56| During the entire pandemic and since, these folks were always on the job and doing it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3656)|
| 1:01:06| There's at least one example of a group that knows what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| It's impossible to know which of these budgeted items are impacted by the classification and compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3671)|
| 1:01:22| So it becomes an all or nothing proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| The city council and the citizens of the city of Knoxville have a right to know the facts behind these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| As a citizen and property owner, the city services I receive have been and continue to be stellar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3696)|
| 1:01:46| Where are the problems really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Some hard work needs to be done by the top management in city government to convince folks that they actually understand what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3709)|
| 1:02:01| It's just far too easy to throw money at the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| Please don't approve these appropriations until you've gone through each of the issues in agenda item 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3727)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Just as a reminder, we're on item 12B as in boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| Next person signed up to speak to this is Chris Ulmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| Mr. Ulmer, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| My name is Chris Ulmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| My address is 4629 Newcomb Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| To be honest, I really don't know about politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| I have very little faith in this type of system, but there are certain elements of it that I hold dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| What I do know a lot about is other people's suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| I guess I'm maybe one of the few that actually gives a damn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| And what I do is talk with a lot of people that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| And I recently went to a homeless meeting at the Tennessee Theater several weeks ago where it was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3793)|
| 1:03:26| There were a lot of people on the panel that had a lot of good things to say and a lot of good things to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3806)|
| 1:03:35| But as I started to gather more from people who have actually spent time in these homeless shelters, the main homeless shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3815)|
| 1:03:48| they're all telling me the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| They're telling me that they need to worry about violence and getting robbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| And some people have even been raped and murdered, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| You guys have law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| I mean you guys have to deal with this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| So you all are right there on the front lines, I feel for you all with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| But what we do with the budget is if we are going to continue to keep doing the same thing over and over again, yet the problem is never being solved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3850)|
| 1:04:24| the only thing that's going to happen is the chickens are going to come home to roost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| And I think we're starting to see that a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| Law enforcement, you guys are seeing that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| At this meeting I met a guy by the name of Chip Grimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| He and I have begun a budding friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| He is a director of the Kenan Grimes Community Outreach Center on Martin Luther King Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| I've spent time over at Chip's center and talked with all of the people over there, and they've all told me the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3892)|
| 1:05:02| That is that they all love Chip and they don't need to fear any type of that type of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| Now I'm not saying that those other places are all bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| But why are we pumping money into the status quo if it's continuing the same problem over and over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3913)|
| 1:05:24| You guys have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| So I think that we need to look deeper and broader than what we are doing, because obviously it's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3926)|
| 1:05:38| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| Council members, that concludes people who signed up to speak on item 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| A budget needs to spend money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| It needs to take care of workers and provide good services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| Mr. Frost, since we're doing the first reading of the budget here, can you talk to us a little bit about what council's obligation is regarding first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3957)|
| 1:06:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Under section 901 of the charter, specifically section E as in echo, entitled public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3968)|
| 1:06:17| it says the council shall pass the budget ordinance on first reading and thereafter the council shall hold public hearings on the proposed operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3977)|
| 1:06:26| as well as on the capital improvement budgets and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| The duty of council under the charter tonight is to pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| So council passes it on first reading and then we hold our already scheduled legislative budget hearings on May 13th, just making sure that's clear to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=3998)|
| 1:06:51| Director Janot, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| Recognizing that it can be difficult to project into the future, are you comfortable that the proposed budget is sustainable given expanding demands in future budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4015)|
| 1:07:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| Sustainable for a period of time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| And how far are you comfortable making that kind of prediction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| I would say that it is sustainable for a period of at least three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| Thank you, Council Member Singh and then Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| I would like to hear the concerns of Councilwoman Parker and some of our speakers regarding the process of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| Just that we are supposed to, it will pass on first reading and actually it will pass on second reading as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| One of the things I like about our council is that we have so many different types of people, so many different opinions, so much different expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4068)|
| 1:07:57| And I would like to see a city charter change that our input was more significant in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4077)|
| 1:08:08| This is where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| Council Member Singh, I feel very confident that I have sought and gotten input from council, not just in the last month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4092)|
| 1:08:22| but way back when I first took office and I asked you all to support my effort to create an HR department, and you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4102)|
| 1:08:31| And then I asked your support through that HR department to do a compensation study, and you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| And then it took a long time and a lot of effort by our employees and by our staff and then by the outside consultant to perform that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4118)|
| 1:08:48| And then we got the study back. You all studied it very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| You did a workshop on it. There was a lot of analysis, a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| And at that time, I clearly indicated that I wanted to bring those recommendations into my budget based on this collective process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4137)|
| 1:09:06| So I feel like council's been walking hand in hand with me on this and with our employees all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| I think a lot of good decisions have been made. I think there are a lot of good things in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| It more has to do with, like, the last item that we looked at, as Councilwoman Parker was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| There were three different items that were all bundled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| And so there are certain things that I want to vote no on, but I felt I could not vote no on the $2,000 benefits given because that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4167)|
| 1:09:41| And yet that meant that the other item that I did not care for, I had to vote yes on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| So I know I bring up this point on a very regular basis that I would like to see more of our items separated so that I can vote on the specific items and how I actually feel on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4188)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you. Councilmember Hugot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Thank you. Director Juneau, just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| I will have many more when we actually get the opportunity to more robustly discuss this at our meeting on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4208)|
| 1:10:20| Just one tidbit. A typical, my understanding is most accountants and most pro formas for businesses only are comfortable doing a pro forma for three years out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4220)|
| 1:10:32| which is what you told the Vice Mayor, that you feel confident that this proposed budget is sustainable with, I suppose, the proposed income stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4232)|
| 1:10:43| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Which is the tax increase for at least a three-year pro forma. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| That would be correct, yes. And if market conditions don't change substantially, negatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| I just, that's pretty industry standard to do a three-year pro forma, so that's what I wanted to make clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| My question for you is, and maybe this is a little premature, but the budget proposal ties directly into the next ordinance, which would be the funding mechanism, which would be the tax setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4268)|
| 1:11:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Of the proposed 50-cent tax increase, can you tell me what, how many cents goes to compensation, how many cents goes to other things, if you can, and if you can't do it today, I want to know by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4286)|
| 1:11:43| I think I can tell you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| If you'd like, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Yeah, if you can, that's great. I just didn't want to hot seat you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Yes, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| So for year one, 31 cents goes to personnel and therefore services, and that includes both the comp study and the normal 2.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4313)|
| 1:12:12| That 2.5%, excuse me, is by ordinance and has been by ordinance by the City Council for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4332)|
| 1:12:20| I'm sorry, I don't have the date on it, but yes, a number of years, a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| For how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| For Mayor Tyree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| It was Mayor Tyree, so it's been a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| One cent is going towards pension increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| Those are future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| Those start in FY24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| But we know about them now and need to build that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| And the difference is going towards what I'm going to call everything else under operations, but inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4369)|
| 1:12:57| Let me pull out a little list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| Inflation for materials and services, new litter program, E911, Medal of Honor and Bassmaster events, our spark accelerator, homeless shower services, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4384)|
| 1:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| And Council Member Fugate, this graph that she put up is on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| The green is people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| The blue is other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Most organizations, people is the biggest part of the budget, so I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| Yes, 80% is going towards people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| So our budget is 80% people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| 80% of the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| 80% of the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| The tax increase is going towards people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Proposed tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Okay, Council Member Ryder and then Council Member Parker after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| I'm just going to address one of the public comments that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| There were comments about the city needing to have audits to make sure that we're adequately spending the funds that come in because we do have funds for multiple sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4437)|
| 1:14:08| There's tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| There's federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| There's grant dollars coming from multiple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| And I will take this up with the administration and the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| But for anyone who wants to read or go through, number one, you can talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| I'll talk to you about the audit process that we do go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| By state law, we have an external audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I'm the audit chair, and several members here are on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| On the city website, it's called the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| And there is one for each year, and an external non-city employee group comes through and does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| And they do randomized testing of different grants, a lot of the federal transportation grants because those are large dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| If someone has things that they think need to be looked at, please let the audit committee know and speak with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| But these are done by non-city employees, so it's not somebody on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| It's someone on the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| And it's not clearly labeled on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| We'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Mr. Roach, you and I can have a talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| That would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| Anyway, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4523)|
| 1:15:32| Just to follow up really quickly on that last piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| I believe what Mr. Roach is interested in seeing is, for example, an audit of, you know, how the federal dollars have been spent that have come into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4537)|
| 1:15:54| Our annual audit does not necessarily highlight those sections in a way that is digestible to the public where a more targeted audit would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4554)|
| 1:16:07| And other cities are able to do it, but I believe we only have one auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| So we don't have the capacity to do as many audits as other cities are able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| My question was about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| I just think this is a good time to clarify the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4581)|
| 1:16:29| The charter calls upon the first reading of the budget to be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| And then our hearings are next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| One question I have for Mr. Frost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| Within that timeline, when our hearings take place next week and then we have a city council meeting that follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4605)|
| 1:16:56| We have at that point missed the deadline to place an item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| If we wanted to place a budget amendment on the upcoming agenda, does the charter require us to hold those hearings next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4622)|
| 1:17:16| Or in a future year, could we schedule them the same week as the city council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| The city charter requires that the budget is passed on first reading first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| And then the public hearing is held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| That's 901E of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| So you'd have to pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| And in between first and second readings, you would have city council and legislative hearings on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| Now, you're not required, assuming the budget passes tonight on first reading, the second reading could be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4666)|
| 1:17:55| Eventually, the budget will need to be passed by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| Or if it does not by the end of the fiscal year, then whatever the charter says, whatever has been proposed by the mayor, is what council is deemed to have accepted or works to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4679)|
| 1:18:12| Does that answer your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| So for this year's budget, the timeline that we are working within does not allow city council members to bring a budget amendment forward that would appear on the agenda unless a council member is able to get their colleagues to agree to postpone the second vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4696)|
| 1:18:41| Or if a budget amendment were proposed after this meeting before we do our hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| I think our law director, Mr. Swanson, could add some clarity to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| Yeah, I don't think that's quite accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| When it comes up for second reading, the budget may be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| It can be amended in the appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| It cannot be amended by line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| And that's where we've run into issues before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| When you are amending the budget, you have to amend by department or organization or fund, and you may not amend by various line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4751)|
| 1:19:21| So you could amend the budget by removing X number of dollars from the recreation department, adding X number of dollars to some other department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4761)|
| 1:19:31| But you can't say specifically within that department how those funds are to be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| But you don't have to get an amendment to the budget on the agenda in order to introduce or in order to propose an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4777)|
| 1:19:47| You do have to have a second, and you do have to have enough votes to pass that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| No, I appreciate that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Based on my experience the last two years, that is near impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| Because a budget amendment is complicated, and it's difficult for other council members to just listen to a motion to amend the budget and then agree with that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4800)|
| 1:20:12| It's better to have materials in your packet that you can study before a meeting in order to agree with a potential budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4812)|
| 1:20:21| And so that's why I say that this process does not allow us to amend the budget in an effective manner where we're able to actually get that language on an agenda so that our fellow council members can study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4821)|
| 1:20:37| One question that I have for Mr. Frost is what would be the process for a council member to send this issue to a city council work group to be further studied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4837)|
| 1:20:55| For this budget that we're presently discussing, Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| Now, to develop a city council work group to study potential amendments to the charter, including the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4860)|
| 1:21:12| Off the top of my head, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| Probably a member of council might be able to form that committee themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| I'd have to look. I'd need the time to look at that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| But I'm sure there's a process in order to have charter items placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4886)|
| 1:21:34| I'm not sure off the top of my head of the process to start that process in its infancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4894)|
| 1:21:44| Do any other council members know what that process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| I will follow up. That's my intention to hopefully start that process this summer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| Okay, thank you. There's a motion on the floor. Item 12B, seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No. Motion carries 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4921)|
| 1:22:10| 12C is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties real, personal, and mixed within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville to provide sufficient revenues to fund the general fund and debt service fund operations and debt service obligations of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4930)|
| 1:22:26| and ending June 30, 2023. Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| Motion made to approve and seconded. There's some people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| First is Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4958)|
| 1:22:46| Hello, Council. My name is Bentley Marlow. I live at 322 Douglas, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| I just wanted to speak. I know raising taxes are never a politically correct thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| You're probably going to get pushback from a lot of people, but I'm somebody that will be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| I brought my little cheat sheet. I have 42 properties here in the city, so a tax increase would affect me fairly significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| I still think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Case in point, just Sunday night, we had another shooting in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| It takes money to have effective public safety, and everything is getting more and more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| It's not just inflation, but it's not just wages. It's just everything's more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| Blame it on COVID, blame it on whatever, but we have to have funds and resources to pay for the services that it takes to be a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| We need adequate police forcing. We need adequate fire protection. We need adequate street cleaning, sanitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5021)|
| 1:23:49| All of those things cost money, and it's costing more and more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| We have a shortage of labor. I have it in my own personal business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| I'm increasing rates, pay rates, double-digit percentages, year over year for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| I'm still at half my capacity, and I can't find skilled tradesmen to replace them with at whatever price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| I'm sure that that's some of what's going on with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| So the least we can do is raise more tax revenue so that we can have a more competitive compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5057)|
| 1:24:25| which we've had this study. It's in the next budget. We just have to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| And like I said, it's going to come out of my pocket, and it's going to come out of my pocket to a greater percentage than it does the average Knoxvillean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5071)|
| 1:24:40| And I'm telling you, I'm okay with it because I don't feel we currently have adequate policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| We don't currently have adequate fire protection. We don't currently have adequate sanitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| We're doing the best we can, but we've got to do more, and that means we have to raise more money. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you. Next person signed up to speak to Item 12C is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5095)|
| 1:25:09| Barbara Cook, Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| I understand the mayor thinks Knoxville is on a roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| A 50 cent property tax increase may just be the momentum to roll the low to middle and fixed income folks right down the hill into the gutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5119)|
| 1:25:35| That, coupled with the recent property reappraisals, might just be enough to lose us our cost of living rating of 11.6 percent below the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5135)|
| 1:25:49| And make us much less attractive as a great place to live, work, and raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5149)|
| 1:25:57| We know the property tax rate will be adjusted downward to ensure no additional funds will reach the city coffers due to the reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5157)|
| 1:26:07| But for those of us whose appraisals went up over 60 percent, adding 50 cents to whatever the rate becomes is something we'll live with through many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5167)|
| 1:26:19| We'll live with it through the years of paying taxes. Again, this item is out of order in more ways than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5179)|
| 1:26:28| Please don't approve this ordinance until a vetting of all the issues in Item 12D have been thoroughly examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5188)|
| 1:26:38| Now I'm going to go off script a little bit here, because I know a lot of you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| I voted for pretty nearly all of you, had yard signs, did some work for a bunch of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| And I'm so disappointed that you have not addressed this issue of what you can do about the budget proposal and when you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5211)|
| 1:27:04| I can't believe that it's come to this. You need to get your heads together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| You want to have a process whereby you really have input and are not standing back here trying to decide whether you have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5230)|
| 1:27:19| or whether you can explain it or whatever or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| You have to demand that you know and understand what's in that budget before it gets this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5245)|
| 1:27:33| This is unbelievable, what we're seeing here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| I saw the same thing the last time around, and it's just plain ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| If you have to have a charter amendment, what's it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| If you have to do some kind of ordinance revision, what does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| Folks, you got to stop talking about stuff and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you. Councilmembers, that concludes people signed up to speak to Item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| I just wanted to give a couple of preparatory remarks and then I'll go to councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| This is a big deal. I don't take this proposal lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| You all were at the State of the City where I shared the reasonings behind this and how crucial I think this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| I just want to give a reminder because it's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| It is our responsibility to keep the momentum of our city going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| We are all navigating in the city some serious challenges that are threatening Knoxville's quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| Our population is growing. Building permits are up by 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| More than ever, police calls alone are up 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| We're all facing skyrocketing inflation here at the city as well, not just at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| We have an acute number of unfilled positions across departments, unprecedented number of vacancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| that's making it hard for us to protect our city and keep it safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| A critical example is this spring we could not attract enough people to run a police academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| and we're 52 people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| Before I brought this proposal to you all, me and my staff carefully scrutinized every aspect of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| We tightened our belts, we optimized efficiencies, and we considered alternatives to a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| which means draconian cuts to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| But the people of Knoxville expect and deserve high-quality services, well-maintained infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| and responsive public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| This tax proposal is to keep essential services up and running, to pay our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| and other city employees a fair market wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| 80% of this proposed increase will go to compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| This is not for frivolous stuff, this is for core essential stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| Essential core services that keep our city running and keep our people safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| Things like police and fire protection, rapid 911 response, curbside trash pickup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| traffic calming projects to keep neighborhoods safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| and so much more that you know from all the work that you do to support our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| So I encourage you to support this, it's not something easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| Being in an elective office we have to make some hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| When we train our police officers, our firefighters, and others, we spend thousands of dollars to train a single one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| And then when they leave a few years into their career, that's not fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| That's not good stewardship of our taxpayer dollars, and it undermines the safety of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| We've had these conversations over the last year, really, and so I appreciate all of your partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| and collaboration in bringing this budget proposal to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| It has been a collaborative effort, and I appreciate all of your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| Thank you, Mayor. We are in an employment crisis, and I intend to vote for this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| This is a crisis not of our creation, but rather we find ourselves in an unprecedented labor market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| We have to meet the demands of this labor market, and the city isn't immune from those pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| We must make a choice together, tonight and in future nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| Do we reduce or eliminate the services we've all come to expect and rely on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| or do we make the difficult decision to compete in this labor market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| We can't continue to understaff KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| We've got to get officers off 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| We can't continue to have our firefighters working 96-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| We can't continue to have leaf and brush pickup when we have 50 vacant positions in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| I would be much more comfortable with something more around 38 or 42 cents, but it's time to make a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| and I choose to continue to provide the services we all rely on and to support our city workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| Now, I don't take this decision lightly, especially when people are struggling with the highest inflation in 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| Let's face it, when you go to the grocery store, everything costs too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| Ultimately, the cost of not acting now, in this crisis, is too great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| If you're taking on water, you can't stop bailing yourself out if the bucket's the wrong size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Thank you. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| I know some of my points have already been iterated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| and the one thing that I will say is I think people who know me and have watched me on Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5607)|
| 1:33:35| know that I'm unequivocally supportive of our first responders, our law enforcement, our frontline workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5615)|
| 1:33:43| But that said, every family in Knoxville and Knox County is already dealing with double-digit inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5623)|
| 1:33:52| feeling the impact of skyrocketing costs on just about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| We've got seniors living on fixed incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| We've got people living paycheck to paycheck that are having to decide between groceries, medicine, gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| We have our commuting workforce that is having to also incur those exorbitant gas prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5649)|
| 1:34:17| And we have been hit with unprecedented property reappraisals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| and while those are still yet to be neutralized per state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| it still means more money that I can't justify taking out of people's pockets, especially now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5665)|
| 1:34:33| And so, therefore, I won't be able to support this tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5673)|
| 1:34:42| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| My concern is about lower-income people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| and I've been looking into what type of assistance is available for people, and there really isn't much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5690)|
| 1:34:57| There's a program from the state and there's a program from the county, and it's about $130 in assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5697)|
| 1:35:06| I do not believe that we can do a progressive tax by state charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5706)|
| 1:35:14| If 80 percent is going to employee compensation, I'd like to make an alternative motion to have a 40-cent increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5714)|
| 1:35:25| which would be 80 percent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| So making an alternative motion to have a 40-cent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5730)|
| 1:35:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Can you repeat the motion to amend this to—can you just state it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| Instead of 50 cents, to change it to a 40-cent increase to the previous tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Motion made, and Council Member Parker, did you second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| Did I hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Council Member Smith, did you want to speak to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| Motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| I don't know if Ms. Juneau or who in the room from finance could speak to us about what would be the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| of lowering that tax increase from 50 to 40 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| That would mean somewhere within the budget there would need to be some cuts for that 10 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| and that would be in the neighborhood of around 5.2 or 5.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5797)|
| 1:36:47| Council Member Fugate, and then Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| Just a question, and I understand from our attorneys, whatever tax rate this council passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5810)|
| 1:37:01| it is still the mayor's decision how to allocate those funds because we determined the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5821)|
| 1:37:09| This would then alter the budget that was just passed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5829)|
| 1:37:17| There would have to be an amendment to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| Right, but I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| And the mayor, if you ultimately end up on second reading adopting a tax rate that's 40 cents rather than 50 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5843)|
| 1:37:32| that means there's $5 million less to spend than is provided for in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5852)|
| 1:37:40| And if that were the case, either council would have to amend and amend only by departmental organizations' funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5860)|
| 1:37:50| or you could depend on the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| If you pass a 40-cent tax increase and that's all you do, then the mayor is going to reduce the budget one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5875)|
| 1:38:05| Because we can't do deficit spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| That's sort of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| So if we pass a tax rate less than the mayor requested to fully fund the budget that she presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5889)|
| 1:38:20| we either as a body must cut the budget with a budget amendment, or it is left to the mayor to find those cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5900)|
| 1:38:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| There are also some things that can't be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| The city by charter has to pay its debt obligations, and there's some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| And for some reason, Penny for Parks is in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| That can't be cut, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| So that would impact salary compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| That would impact everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| My next question, and this is just a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| If the tax rate question is postponed until after we have our budget hearings and we really understand better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5945)|
| 1:39:15| I mean, yes, we've had conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| We've known the intent of the budget, but we actually got the document a little over a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| We haven't had our public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| If some of the angst about the tax rate, and it may pass tonight, I'm just asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| is there a procedural problem to postpone a tax rate vote even though we have approved the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5974)|
| 1:39:45| I know it would have to pass on two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| The charter does not compel you to pass a tax rate on the first reading at the same time you do the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| Now, ultimately, by the time you adopt a budget, you're going to have to adopt a tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| And that ordinance would also require two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Do you have to pass it on first reading tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| No, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| And then we would have to pass the tax rate ordinance twice or do it on emergency reading at the second reading of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6008)|
| 1:40:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| Council member writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| Well, I commend the motion on the floor, which is to look for a way to soften the blow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| It has to be something to tied to it as to what's going to be cut from the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| So I need some correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| So what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| So, director, you know, I'm assuming that you guys crunched a lot because I honestly have not had a blunt conversation with you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6041)|
| 1:40:51| So I am general. I'm genuinely assuming there was a lot of crunching various numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| I'm very familiar with past tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| There was one under Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| There was one under Mayor Harrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| There were many under the previous mayor and many other mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| And we have charts of that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| We also have a chart in our budget that shows what today's two point four six tax rate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| It's equivalent to one point nine eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| Tell me how you got to the 50 cents and what that means by reducing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| You know, two cents, five cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I mean, what what did you guys look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| How did we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| So each excuse me, each penny on the tax rate is estimated to be worth currently five hundred and twenty two thousand three hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6095)|
| 1:41:47| Say that again. I'm writing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| Five hundred twenty two thousand three hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| That's what each penny buys you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| And that's estimated based on our current property assessor valuations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| So the current proposed ones are the current ones in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| Just the current ones in place in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| OK, because clearly that's muddy in the water for a lot of folks is the we're in an assessment year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| And that makes this extra confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| Yes. Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| For me and everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| So that's kind of the basis for what a penny buys you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| And in this case, we know that there was priority given to the comp study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| And therefore, two years were built in specifically on the front end because there is a compounding effect to that comp study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6155)|
| 1:42:46| So two years were built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| That's where the 80 percent for people comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| And that is worth the 40 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| The other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| There's a penny in there for the pension, as I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| And the other nine cents currently would be going to other operating items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Mr. No, I just want to just give a little more context to this writer's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| My directive to our CFO, Mr. No, was to help me develop a budget that fully implements the compensation plan and deals with the other issues such as inflation and debt service and pension and to keep it under 35 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6193)|
| 1:43:30| I didn't want to be setting going above previous mayor's tax levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| You know, that was not my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| But so they worked on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| She and her whole team worked really hard to keep it to 35 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| And they came back and wasn't quite there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| And I was like, keep trying, keep trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| And it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| And we couldn't make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| We couldn't make it work at 35 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| We couldn't make it work at 34 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| And then I had to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| Is this a labor market issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Is this staffing shortage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Are these 12-hour shifts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Is this a surge capacity that all our employees have been experiencing for not just two years but in some cases decades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| Is that something that we can sustain and still maintain our quality of life and public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| And my answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| And so the best politics for me would be to wait or keep it lower and trickle it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6260)|
| 1:44:28| But we have an acute situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| And I was committed to adopting the commutation plan fully this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| And that's a commitment I made to employees, and that's a commitment that I think they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| And that's not just because of their dedication and their being under market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| We have the study to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| And their ability to serve our residents can only go so far at these staffing levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| It's a critical situation on essential services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| This is not fluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| This is essential services and core things that matter to the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| So we tried to do it at 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| And so that's why I'm bringing this higher-level proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| Ms. Juneau, if you want to elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| But that's the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| It was not my goal to do 50 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| It was my goal to do 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| We tried very hard to make it work with 35 cents, and we could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Mayor or Director Juneau, I think it will be very important to remember that in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| and again, this decision to do it this year was not an easy decision, obviously, for the mayor or for finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| during a reappraisal, we will be back here in August with a new certified tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6336)|
| 1:45:42| By state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| By state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Not by our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| This is not the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| You know, that's an important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| How that's done is separate from both bodies of government, city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| So we do not have all that information yet from Mr. Whited and the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| but we believe that we will have, again, a final certified tax rate that's below 40 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6357)|
| 1:46:05| The value of the penny will change after the reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| And so we're waiting on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| Because we know what we need based on each penny being worth 522,300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| but we don't know what that number is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| So we're at 246.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| We had to bring a budget to our community and to the elected officials based on that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| We had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| And right now we need a 50 cent tax rate to get what is proposed in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| But we will be back here in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| And that rate will drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| And the numbers we have, again, right now, are that the overall certified tax rate is going to be about $2.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| Give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| We don't have the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| We don't have the estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| But it will be lower than it has been since we look back to 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| And so it will be the lowest since 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Director Janot, that's a question and a conversation you and I have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| And I didn't quite understand when you told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| So the estimates based on the appraisals are that the current 246 will go down to 1.75 ballpark-ish, 71 cents, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6422)|
| 1:47:12| I mean, again, we're ballparking, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| That would be our hope based on the information we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| Based on the information available from the assessor, but the comptroller in the state can't give us hard numbers because they don't have all the info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6437)|
| 1:47:26| Because the tax assessor is still going through the property assessor for the county, though the mayor has been blamed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| I don't think she has time in her day to assess all the properties, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| The county tax assessor does not have all the info on the property assessments to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| And because they're still going through the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| So the 50 cents that we're talking about, you've discussed with me in a phone call that that would actually not be 50 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6467)|
| 1:47:56| that it would potentially be a different value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| That is the expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| A lesser, not an upper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| Just like the base reappraisal, rolling back to something lesser, the increase will do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6482)|
| 1:48:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| Councilmember Ryder, my understanding and, you know, language I understand is that this proposal, if approved, would raise the rate by 50 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6497)|
| 1:48:26| and we anticipate that after John Whitehead is done with the property assessment process and it gets certified by the state, it would go down 70 to 72 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6506)|
| 1:48:35| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| That's not something we can do anything more than estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| And that increase is minus 22 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| That's where we get to the 1974 tax rate level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| Appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| Councilmember Smith and then Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| You know, just as a reminder, next Friday we have eight hours of digging into the budget of a fine tooth comb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| So I'm looking forward to doing that with my colleagues and practical realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| Director Juneau may not be looking forward to it as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Oh, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| It's game time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| You know, so practical realities, whether we approve this on first reading, whether we approve the suggested amendment, whether we postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| we're going to all talk about this until we get a headache next Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| So just feel confident that we're going to wrestle this as much as we need to to get it right, or at least to the extent we think is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6565)|
| 1:49:35| Director Juneau, just some simple math, I think, for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| We've thrown around a lot of cents and dimes and nickels here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| So based on the recent assessment forecasted, can you kind of project how much somebody could expect to pay on their home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6582)|
| 1:49:54| If it's now a $100,000 home, it's a $200,000 home, what am I expected to put the increment, the 50-cent increment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6594)|
| 1:50:04| Yes, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| For a $100,000 home, the monthly increase should be around $10.42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| I would even say or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| Monthly increase for a $200,000 home, $20.83, and for a half-million-dollar home, $52.08 monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6617)|
| 1:50:27| So a $200,000 home, I'm going to pay $250 more a year for better public safety, all the things included in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6627)|
| 1:50:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| I think that helps folks at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| They've been looking at appraisal sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| They look at those numbers real close to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| I think for the public, those are some numbers to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| So currently, the revenue is about 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| The annual incremental revenue is 2.5%, but expenses, I believe, are growing at about 3% and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6653)|
| 1:51:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| Actually, revenue may be more like 1.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Yes, the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| The revenue is less than expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| I do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| So how long would this tax increase last us if revenue and expenses were held flat for the next while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6675)|
| 1:51:26| If revenue and expenses were held flat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| Let me rephrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| If we approve this 50% tax increase and expenses didn't exceed that for the foreseeable future every year, that new budget every year, how long would this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6691)|
| 1:51:43| We have projected out that our expectation would be that this can make it for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6703)|
| 1:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| So back to the vice mayor's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Same answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| Vice Mayor Roberto, and just as a reminder, I mean, we're still debating the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| And so I wanted to speak to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| So I absolutely understand the reason to bring the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| Like I said in my initial remarks, I'm outside my comfort zone too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6729)|
| 1:52:16| I mean that's not the number I was expecting at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| But I think that it is irresponsible if we are moving forward, whether we're required to or not, with the budget, to then not also take care of funding for the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6739)|
| 1:52:33| And what I really don't want to see is, and it was mentioned, if we ended up having to vote on this measure on emergency, that is a horrible thing for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6753)|
| 1:52:46| And I would never support doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| So I think what we need to do here, even though I completely understand where you're coming from, we have our legislative budget hearings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6769)|
| 1:52:56| There's a great opportunity for us to explore this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| So I would suggest that we go ahead, move forward here, and then we address amendments in second reading because we will have time to do it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6779)|
| 1:53:08| That would be my suggestion, and that's what I'll vote on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| The motion on the floor is to amend it from 50 to 40 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| All opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| The motion to amend fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| Now back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| I've chosen to say little and listen a lot tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| I'm really looking forward to our budget hearing and discussing all this with my colleague, not outside the system, of course, but with constituents and staff and study this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6815)|
| 1:53:51| This is not to be read as any kind of entrenched position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| I just feel more comfortable right now until I wait until the legislative budget hearing and we have a full discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6836)|
| 1:54:06| And as far as I'm concerned right now, all issues are on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| But to me, I've studied this a lot, but I want to study it some more and get some more feedback from constituents and city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6850)|
| 1:54:21| So I'm going to abstain on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| Council members, I've just asked for your support on this first reading, and I look forward to answering even more detailed questions from you all and constituents in the weeks ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6867)|
| 1:54:38| But I would appreciate your support on this vote on first reading today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6884)|
| 1:54:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| We're now back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| And I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| So all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| I think it was 5, 3, 1 or 5, 2, 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| Okay, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6917)|

| 1:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| Next item, please, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| 12D is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| to amend Chapter 2, Article 3 and Chapter 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| Article 2 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| to adjust the classification and compensation plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| and implement recommendations of the 2021-2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| Classification and Compensation Study Final Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Council members, there's several people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| And the first one signed up is Robby Corum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| Mr. Corum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=6992)|
| 1:56:42| Robby Corum, 108 Oakwood Drive, Maynardville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| Members of Council, I want to thank you for taking time to listen to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| on this very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| I've been a city employee since 2004, so in 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| I've had the pleasure of hiring several of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| I've had the pleasure of promoting several of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| When I tell you that the unprecedented state that we find ourselves in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| is unrecognizable, know that I don't take that lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| I can remember in the early 2010s how that we would have a list of applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| waiting to become an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| how we would have a list of people just waiting to promote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| And in the state that we find ourselves in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| public service where I work has 41 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| We have been as high as 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| In the last six months, we've lost employees to one company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| One of them was a 12-year veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| All of these were CDL drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| We don't just compete with other municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| We compete with the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| As I drove in today, I saw on 275 that Cisco has a billboard up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| and they are offering employees a $2,500 sign-on bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| and $19.29 an hour to come work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| We are proposing a $15 an hour entry-level wage for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| Note that that brings us to a level where we can compete with McDonald's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| and we can compete with Chick-fil-A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| and we can compete with companies at the rate that high school seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| are able to go into entry-level workforces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| It still doesn't bring us to a high salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| but it brings us to a place where we can actually be competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| at least to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| Our benefits packages here are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| I'm an 18-year veteran, and I absolutely love working for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| I love the job that we're able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| but know that we're not going to be able to keep up in the pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| and the way that we're going right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| With the 41 vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| I want to put that into a little bit of perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Our public service department is broken up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| into North, South, East, West districts, kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| where we go out and we perform your basic yard maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| We do the brush pickup biweekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| We sweep the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| We repair the potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| We mow the right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| We take care of the basic necessities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Each one of those departments has 23 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| So with us being down 41 and having been down 49,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| we would basically eliminate two of those service departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| So could you imagine how it would be received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| if we told West and East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| we're just not going to pick up your stuff anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| It wouldn't be received very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| but that's the staffing shortages that we've been dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| That's the things that we're trying to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| Fortunately, we are broken up across multiple departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| and we've been able to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| We've been able to get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| We've been able to follow through with the promises that we've given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| But I don't know how sustainable it will be should this not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| Should we not be able to increase the wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| I don't know how long we can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| With companies like Amazon moving in and offering higher wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| it's great for our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| but it's going to draw more and more people away from our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| and our ability to hire and our ability to retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| In my career, I've started off as a weed-eater person in horticulture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| and I've worked my way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| I've worked my way up through the chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| In my career, I have left my family on storm nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| I've been 50 feet in a bucket truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| cutting trees out of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| cutting trees during torrential downpours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| to be able to open roadways for KUB to restore power to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| I've been here during snow events, along with my colleagues and my crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| I myself came in on Christmas Day 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| so that we could open up streets and make it safe for our citizens to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| I want to say that in 2011, when storms hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| I and my crews were in here working 14-hour days, six days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| not because we were making a killing, not because of the extra overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| but because we wanted to provide a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| and we wanted to restore Knoxville to the place that it needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| So in closing, I want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| Knoxville, we've been there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| For 18 years, I've been there for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| and my crews have been there along with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| We've been there for you, and we want to ask you to be there for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| Next person signed up to speak to Item 12D is Larry McAfee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7290)|
| 2:01:41| Hello again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| I've been an employee for the City of Knoxville Fire Department for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| My predecessor, Kevin Faddis, has been at this for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| It's been the same story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| We hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| We got your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| You know what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| We've done a few studies before now, not fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| American Kennedy has been bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| She's going to do this in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| She wanted to have our back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| We need you all to have our back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| We have examples of captains that have been in our positions for 15 years plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| and they're not even at midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| This new plan being proposed by the HR Department with step pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| we're hoping they will at least get to midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| So I ask you all, have our back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Next person signed up to speak is Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7354)|
| 2:02:43| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| I live at 6016 Apache Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| I work in the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| here representing the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| I really want to thank the mayor and HR for conducting this compensation plan study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| You know, the city hires engineers like myself, but also consultants hire engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7382)|
| 2:03:09| TDOT hires engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Knox County hires engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| So if our salaries don't keep up, we have trouble attracting those entry-level positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7393)|
| 2:03:20| We have trouble retaining those experienced positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| We have a similar situation even in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| You know, if you want to be an attorney, you go to the same school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| and get past the same bar exam that someone does in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| So the city competes for those employees, whether it's in engineering, in law, in finance, in IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| So it's imperative that we don't have to be the highest paid employer out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7426)|
| 2:03:53| but we have to stay close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| So this compensation plan keeps us close where people who want to work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| who enjoy this line of work, who enjoy serving the public as we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| and as I have for 42 years, can keep on doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| So I appreciate, Mayor, what you've done, and I encourage council to support this pay plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7451)|
| 2:04:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| One person signed up to speak in opposition to this, Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7462)|
| 2:04:31| Surprise, I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| Barbara Cook, Jenkipen Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| It is a mistake to take the easy way out and simply accept everything presented at face value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7480)|
| 2:04:47| There is much work to be done before accepting the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| that will cost Knoxville taxpayers long into the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| and may not improve the effectiveness, efficiency, or morale of city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7495)|
| 2:05:03| Consider the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| Salary is not the driving force to attract and retain qualified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| As was stated in the MAG presentation, while salary may always be among the top three motivators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| it is not number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| The city has a very attractive benefits package, including a very liberal carryover leave policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| that deserves attention before it becomes a significant unfunded liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7528)|
| 2:05:36| The proposed pay plans for general government, that's general government I'm talking about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| need not be aligned at 100% of the market averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| It should be possible to run models at 80% or 90% of market average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7549)|
| 2:05:56| for purposes of comparison that might make more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| This might help you out of this problem with your tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| If you weren't trying to do 100%, you might have a little bit of wiggle room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7564)|
| 2:06:12| There are at least two problems with the proposed 3.5% across-the-board COLA increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7572)|
| 2:06:20| Across-the-board increases do nothing to solve or resolve salary compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7580)|
| 2:06:28| This forward-looking proposal would be following the same practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| that has created the compression that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| It's simple math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| Add the same percentage increase to a $100,000 a year salary and a $50,000 a year salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7599)|
| 2:06:47| and the larger salary gets a significantly larger increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7607)|
| 2:06:53| While I consider this entire proposal to be inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| how about capping the increase at those who make $80,000 a year or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7617)|
| 2:07:05| Chasing the impact of inflation is a mindless exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| The city has given an annual 2.5% COLA increase every year, regardless of inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7629)|
| 2:07:16| Cost of living in the city of Knoxville, once again, is 11.6% below the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7636)|
| 2:07:25| All of us need to do some belt tightening from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| especially those in the higher pay brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| There is no reason to believe that the city of Knoxville is in any worse shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| than the thousands of employers in the country right now who are having trouble hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| The more important question to answer is whether the city is at the optimum staffing level in each department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7665)|
| 2:07:54| This requires a complete department-by-department staffing analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7674)|
| 2:08:00| That is, how many people are required to meet the desired service levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7680)|
| 2:08:07| minimum, midpoint, and maximum service levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| and what is the impact of not reaching each of these levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| I believe the city would be in a better position to accurately and appropriately pay their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| if they engaged them in a positive process of defining their role in the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| and how their success is measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| It has been my experience that organizations who use the results and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| provided by a consultant study to take a good look at how they can best use those results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| and recommendations to improve their organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| fare much better than those who take it as an opportunity to dust their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| and consider the problem handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| The city of Knoxville has an opportunity, by doing the necessary work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| to transition from the close-enough-for-government work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| into a well-managed, responsive, and responsible workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| prepared to take on the challenges of continued growth in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| Good luck, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| Thank you. Council members, there's one more person signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| Knoxville Police Department Rep. Jason Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| Your rules are three in favor and three opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| I assume you're willing to suspend your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| I'd say we suspend the rules, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| Motion made to suspend the rules. Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| Sorry, I just wanted to follow your rules, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| Mr. Booker, Investigator Booker, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| Thank you. Jason Booker, 800 Howard Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| I'm a 24-year veteran of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| 12 years on patrol, 12 years in investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| Dealt with some politics along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| I was a beer inspector for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| Worked for Mr. Swanson, worked for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| We need you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| We've been let down before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| We've had the can kicked down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| We've had the rug pulled out from under us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| We need you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Like my counterpart at KFD said, we've had your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| We've had the city's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| Now we need you to turn to favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| And I appreciate your time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Council members, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| People signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Vice Mayor Roberto, then Council Member Parker, then Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| So Item 12D adopts the results of the compensation study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| which Council had a very in-depth workshop on and I fully support to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7859)|
| 2:11:06| There are other pieces to this as well that are separate from the compensation study adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| That's the $2,000 retention bonus and the extra 3.5% over the usual 2.5% cost of living adjustment for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7872)|
| 2:11:23| Every employee is going to get the 2.5% COLA increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| They always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| It's in the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| And I'm just – I believe that these increases need to go to workers who the compensation study most identified as undercompensated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7894)|
| 2:11:45| those at the beginning of the pay scale rather than at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| I'm not comfortable with an across-the-board approach here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| We need to target those most impacted, limit the pay raises, one-time bonuses to those earning less than $100,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7912)|
| 2:12:01| and certainly not more than $120,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| We've asked a lot of the taxpayers tonight, and I think we should make those amendments tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7924)|
| 2:12:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| All right, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| Or is your light on inadvertently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| No, it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| I just – I thought that – I thought a motion was coming, so I wasn't ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7941)|
| 2:12:30| It's getting late, and really what Vice Mayor Roberto said aligns with what I was thinking, so I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7950)|
| 2:12:39| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| I don't know who to ask this question to, so I'll ask it into the ether and someone can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| I assume that as the budget is prepared that department heads are asked to do a study about staffing levels to see if staffing levels are adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7968)|
| 2:13:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Mayor, I assume you asked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| Mr. Brace, can you just share some details on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| Yeah, and actually this year we created a new process where we specifically outlined people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| So we used to have supplemental requests, and it was all lumped in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| Now we have additional funding requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| It could be a contract that has an escalator in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| It could be I need X amount of to move forward with an initiative, or it could be a new program like a litter program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8007)|
| 2:13:35| But we also have each director is tasked with requesting more people if they need it and to assess whether or not they have enough or more than what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8015)|
| 2:13:45| And we funded very, very few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| For example, public service has requested some additional specialty crews, and those are not in the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8029)|
| 2:13:57| But, yes, every year directors who are the experts in their area are tasked with evaluating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8037)|
| 2:14:03| I just think it's important that we as council people and taxpayers understand that just because there's been X number of head count in a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8043)|
| 2:14:15| doesn't mean that that's always going to be that number of head count, that it can go down, it can go up, and that that is looked at every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8055)|
| 2:14:24| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| I just think that needs to be said, that we look at it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| Now, to my colleague, Vice Mayor Roberto, I understand that sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| I don't wholeheartedly disagree with it, but I also, and if it's just directed at lower level, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8082)|
| 2:14:51| I do have some concern that we are making assumptions that people who make a certain dollar amount are also not vulnerable to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8091)|
| 2:15:01| and that they are also not undercompensated for their positions, such as, you should know, attorneys and some of the higher professional employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8101)|
| 2:15:12| So I just bring, no matter what we decide, I do want to go on record that I don't think anybody in the city is grossly overpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8112)|
| 2:15:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| I'm not saying that's what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| I just am saying that out loud because there's a lot of discussion about if you make a certain dollar amount, it applies that you are grossly overpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8127)|
| 2:15:36| and I fundamentally reject that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| And just a clarification, Vice Mayor Roberto, the $2,000 bonus payment is part of the MAG study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| That was part of their recommendation, and the 3.5% COLA was also part of the comp study across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8146)|
| 2:15:55| As you recall, they found that, on average, city employees are below market by 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8155)|
| 2:16:03| So this across the board, 6% is not even getting everybody up to market, and the rest of the equity pay is what they're calling it to get people up to market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8163)|
| 2:16:12| is based on individually studying every position and their peers across the peer group selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8172)|
| 2:16:19| So whether you're a higher paid IT specialist or engineer or a public service worker, one, they studied it, and then they made recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8179)|
| 2:16:31| So that's why I incorporated these in the proposal, because they do have expertise, and they chose peer entities with input from our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8191)|
| 2:16:43| And I don't want to be doing arbitrary and capricious raises just because I care about our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8203)|
| 2:16:50| They need raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| I believe that, but I didn't want to just be a magic wand guessing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| So that's why we have the power of the study, and that's why I put it in this proposal, because it's based on detailed analysis, not just wishful thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8214)|
| 2:17:04| So I just did want to make those corrections for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| Councilmember Thomas and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| The discussion between Councilmember Cook and Vice Mayor Roberto is exactly what I want to dig into more and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8232)|
| 2:17:26| Most of the comments that I've had from constituents is not at all negative toward the city workers getting raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8246)|
| 2:17:38| and I certainly intend to, at the end of this, make sure that there's a fair compensation package for our city employees for reasons that have already been eloquently said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8258)|
| 2:17:54| I think we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| I tend to lean a bit toward what Councilman Roberto said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| The concerns that I've heard from constituents and also from people that I respect in the community and have knowledgeable over years is that we should concentrate on the mid-level and lower-level employees the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8282)|
| 2:18:22| And they do have doubts that raising the compensation for high-level employees is not fair to taxpayers and also may not be an incentive for keeping them on the force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8302)|
| 2:18:44| There's an idea that I want to explore more, and it's what I'm hearing, is that $100,000 is an arbitrary number that's been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8324)|
| 2:18:54| But people are wondering, if you're making $100,000 and you get a 6% raise and the guy making $20,000 or $30,000 gets 6% raise, the amounts are significantly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8334)|
| 2:19:11| And at a person making $100,000, is that going to be really an incentive to keep them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8351)|
| 2:19:19| So I know I'm repeating some of the issues that were all thought about, but this is why I would like to reserve my overall judgment until after we have the budget hearing and then really have a whole day to flesh all this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8359)|
| 2:19:38| So that's just a summary of what I'm thinking at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| Thank you. Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| Thank you, Mayor. I want to applaud particularly the $15 an hour minimum that's been included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8387)|
| 2:19:54| I think this compensation study is the bulk of what's been proposed for next year, so I think it's worth digging into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| And there's been a lot of – most of what's been said I share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| Everybody wants to pay folks good wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| We value them. We don't want them to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| We also don't want to raise taxes any more than we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| So I think there's plenty of room in there for all of us to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| I do think I just want to call out that the turnover is the highest at the lowest pay grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8415)|
| 2:20:22| Retirement is the biggest driver of turnover for general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| But speaking of, we approved pensions tonight and Director Wade's not here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| and I just want to give a shout out for her commitment to the city over the years and the contributions that she's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8432)|
| 2:20:41| I also wanted to say that I think the compensation that we're focused on should be kind of at the intersection of market competitiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8441)|
| 2:20:52| fairness among pay grades, and prevention of turnover and or retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8452)|
| 2:20:59| So I just think that's the sweet spot that I'll be looking at for the next week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| I think all of these matters are related, so I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| There's two readings, like I said, from the previous ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| We'll discuss all of these at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| I don't think any of these stand alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| They are all interrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| I'll be supporting this on the first reading, but there's plenty to unpack in the meeting next week, so that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| Council Member McKenzie and then Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| One question for a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| Adjustments to base salaries are taken into consideration with the compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| Is that an accurate statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| So there will be some mitigation on those salaries that are grossly out of line to bring them up to a comparable level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| That's a huge part of what this is all about is dealing with that compression, and it's about retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8509)|
| 2:21:56| I mean, like when people don't see that their salaries are increasing when they're 10 years in, 15 years in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| then it's demoralizing and it's making people eager or not eager to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| They love working for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| We have very dedicated people that are proud to serve, but dedication probably doesn't pay the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| Well, thank you for that answer because I think that we've been focusing a lot on the bonus or the gap pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| rather than the adjustments that are included in this budget to mitigate the compensation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| and to bring those lower and mid-grade salaries up to par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| I think we're making a lot of assumptions because someone might make $80,000 or $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8552)|
| 2:22:38| We don't know what their personal circumstances are, and I think it appears to me that we seem to be making some assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| We don't know if that is a one-family household income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| We don't know if they're medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| We just don't know what people's personal situations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| so when I hear really kind of downing people making a certain amount, getting a certain bonus or increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8574)|
| 2:23:03| I just don't think that that's fair in all circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| and we cannot discriminate based on a person's circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| And so I don't see a problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| I do think that it is admirable that, Mayor, you and your staff and some other folks are not taking those increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8594)|
| 2:23:21| I think that that speaks volumes, and as I've told the Mayor, none of us like to pay more in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8601)|
| 2:23:29| No one likes to pay a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| Even if it's five cents, we'd have an issue with it, but we are a growing city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| We're a city that we have talked extensively tonight about some of the disparities in pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8617)|
| 2:23:43| some of the issues that we have, that we have our law enforcement, our firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| our service workers who are working an enormous amount of overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| We are not able to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| We're not able to, at this point, been able to compensate them appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| And so as we continue to grow, at some point you get what you pay for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| and we cannot continue to work people into the ground and not compensate them fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8644)|
| 2:24:10| and also make it an even playing field to attract more employees into these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| that can help balance and leverage that workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| So I think we've had extensive and really good conversation about this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| but I'm ready to move on once we address the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8668)|
| 2:24:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| Councilmember Reiser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| I think Councilwoman McKenzie had some nice broad closing statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| but I actually have a question that I'd like to get into the weeds on, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| I can't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| I'd just like to make an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| I would like Director Weth to come up and answer a question for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| Some of the questions that have arisen while we're discussing this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| have we looked at manpower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| And so I know that that specifically has been done in this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| because we've discussed it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| So, Director Weth, for the good of the public and support of this, because I do support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8705)|
| 2:25:11| I would like you to tell us in maybe one minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| or whatever you can condense it to for my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| what have you guys done to spread your manpower out and reduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8718)|
| 2:25:24| be efficient with your use of employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| I mean, I think Chad Weth, Public Service Director, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| I mean, I think that's part of my job is to always make sure we're being as efficient as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| I think it was Councilwoman Fugate's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| That's something we look at every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| Not too long ago, we went to a north, south, east, west, central zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| We used to have six zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| We dropped down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| A reason for that is simply because I thought we could be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| We also used to run two men on knuckle boom trucks, and now we run one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| That was a change that a lot of other cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| It was hard for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| There's probably some operators behind me that it's still hard for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| So we figured out a way to go more lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| I mean, that's what every company does, and that's what we try to do in service as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| So serving those four areas, were we able to reduce the number of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| or were we able to broaden services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| Yeah, I mean, it's really just putting services where they're most needed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| I always talk about horticulture a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| We've added parks, several parks in my 13 years here, the lakeshores, the sutteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| You know, maybe taking resources over here that may not be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| and putting them over here where they are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| There's plenty of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| There's not a lack of maintenance out there in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| We look at that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| And as populations have moved to different parts of town, like say for downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| used to be tumbleweeds blowing around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| So you move some employees and manpower to that versus saying, hey, administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| I need to add 10 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| You found a way to go lean in some areas to add them to where we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| I mean, and, you know, I see needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| One of the things Mr. Brasher suggested was, you know, I think downtown we need more horticulture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| We need downtown to look great every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| But asking for people when we're also 41 short is kind of weird, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| But, yes, we look at that all the time about where we have needs, and we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| We've moved people around and shuffled to the areas that are most in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| Okay, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| I just wanted a real example to illustrate some of the conversation that's come up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8842)|
| 2:27:27| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| I just wanted to point out quickly following the conversation that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| the issue for me is that we have to take care of the lowest paid workers first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| and I'm concerned that we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| The $15 minimum wage as a living wage is at least over a decade old now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8866)|
| 2:27:55| If you look at MIT's living wage calculator, $15 an hour is a living wage for a single individual with no children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8875)|
| 2:28:03| If that person is married, has a dependent, that's no longer a livable wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8883)|
| 2:28:08| It jumps up to about $23 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| And so that's why I'm concerned that there are these across-the-board raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8891)|
| 2:28:19| especially when a lot of these folks are in public service where we do have vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8899)|
| 2:28:25| to feel that we're not more focused on that lower end of the pay scale to ensure that we are setting positions at a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8905)|
| 2:28:39| I guess I think that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| Counsel, I just wanted to just share a relevant data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8923)|
| 2:28:49| You know, this compensation study totals $16 million, and I've already excluded, you know, my Cabinet is not eligible for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8929)|
| 2:28:59| And of the people who earn over $100,000, that's 28 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8939)|
| 2:29:06| and their share of the proposed budget of the compensation comes to $147,000 of the $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8946)|
| 2:29:14| So we're talking about, I mean, that's not a small amount of money, but out of the $16 million, that's 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8954)|
| 2:29:23| It's not a significant cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| It's not going to be able to help us reallocate in any significant way to any other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| So I think that's important for you all to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| And it also, to me, sends a message that, you know, I want to send a message that all our employees matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8974)|
| 2:29:43| And when we hear great leadership and management skills from our HR director, from our public service director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8983)|
| 2:29:51| you know, these are the people who help us be more efficient, who help us attract and retain and develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| and have career paths for our entire staff, our entire workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| And that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| Great leadership matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| Those skills matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| And I just wanted to give you that context about the actual financial thing you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9005)|
| 2:30:10| It's a small portion of the overall proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9010)|
| 2:30:16| So I hope you'll vote in favor of Item 12B on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| and we can discuss it more at your legislative budget hearings on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| I have a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| For the budget hearings, could we get a figure of what the cost is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9028)|
| 2:30:38| the salary increase cost is for employees over the $80,000 mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9038)|
| 2:30:47| Just for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| We're throwing out arbitrary numbers, so let's look at that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9048)|
| 2:30:55| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| I would just underline that last point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| That would be really helpful, I think, in our analysis of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| if you could see what the actual amount of savings, I guess you might want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9062)|
| 2:31:09| from going down the ladder some but keeping the lower employees solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9069)|
| 2:31:17| But if you could do maybe various calculations to see how much actual dollars we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9077)|
| 2:31:25| by not giving the 3% to the higher-up, but they would still get their 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9085)|
| 2:31:34| Yes, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| Are you interested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9096)|
| 2:31:37| I think I heard $80,000 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| Yeah, I mean, I think we can start to slice and dice some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| I don't know if we can do every single level, but if we can try to provide some context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9101)|
| 2:31:47| and obviously Dr. Drummond and we'll be there during legislative budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| We'll have the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9113)|
| 2:31:54| I do want to note one thing about, number one, $50 an hour was huge for public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9114)|
| 2:31:59| and I agree it could be higher in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| I do want to say that one of the reasons we've had compression significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| especially in police and fire, is we have raised those entry-level positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| So those entry-level jobs, especially in police and fire, not so much in public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| have been raised, which has caused a whole lot of this compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| So we have, in an attempt to attract people into those jobs over the last three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9138)|
| 2:32:23| we've raised those minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| And so I do think that, yes, we've got to look at the minimum for those entry-level jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| but we've also got to look at the mid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| That's where the compression was, and that's where we've spent a lot of money on training people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| is the five- and ten-year individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| So I just wanted to note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| If you could just maybe in $10,000 increments from the top down do an estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9158)|
| 2:32:45| or give us some figures about the dollar savings, I think that would be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| and I think it would be helpful with the public, too, as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9170)|
| 2:32:54| who are concerned about the issue that I mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| We looked at $100,000 and up for Councilwoman Singh based on a request from her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| and we can do that for other levels as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9187)|
| 2:33:13| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9195)|
| 2:33:16| I'm going to add some more to your plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| Could you also what would it take for us to bring the part-time employees to a decade-old living wage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9198)|
| 2:33:25| We've got that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| It's $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| It's another penny and a half on the tax increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| $700,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9212)|
| 2:33:33| It's about $722,150, I think, but I'd have to go back and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| But, again, if a penny is $522,000, it's another penny and a half to add them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9218)|
| 2:33:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9228)|
| 2:33:50| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9230)|
| 2:33:51| I'm like, oh, now we're talking about jacking the tax rate up more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| I just on this list of things to bring to us, Dr. Drummond, I'm going to put a request to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9236)|
| 2:34:03| There's a lot of conversation here about across-the-board increases, but this was a compensation study was a job-by-job analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9243)|
| 2:34:14| Everybody did JAQs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| Not all positions were off-market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| You do not need to answer me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| We've got the budget hearing coming up, and we can get deep dive into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| So the question I'm posing to you is what percentage or how many jobs, how does it shake out to what didn't get an adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9272)|
| 2:34:42| that was already on par based on a 30-study analysis, my understanding from conversations with you, was at market rate or nearish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9282)|
| 2:34:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9293)|
| 2:34:54| We can provide that information specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| You want them by position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| Is that what you're asking for, or do you want it for departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| We can give you the information specific to position to determine if that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| but we're not able to give you by person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| I'm not asking by person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| We're having a lot of conversation about salary levels, like above this amount and above that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| Some of these things didn't change, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| If they change, they change very minimally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| And so what we looked at was to determine what the current salary structure looks like, and if that position was within the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9328)|
| 2:35:37| I know that there was a question at some point to say, are we 100% in the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| Our striving rate was to get between 80% and 90% of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9341)|
| 2:35:46| Our rate was not to get to 100% of the market in most positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| We did strive to get to 100% of the market for uniform government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| But I also need you all to know that we did not have significant or any, and I can't tell you specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9355)|
| 2:36:03| very minimal changes in salary structure for employees at that highest level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| Because we looked at that, the pay band and the pay structure is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| but we are not advocating to go in and increase a director's pay by X percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9375)|
| 2:36:23| What you all are, as we look at this, you think about the COLA and that 3.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9383)|
| 2:36:29| and what I want to make sure I explain to you all, that that COLA has nothing to do with compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9389)|
| 2:36:35| That's first off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| It has nothing at all to do with compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| When you do a salary study and you look at this, you have to determine where the min, the mid, and the max is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9399)|
| 2:36:47| and then you start looking at where people fall and how the positions rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| And so what you have is a situation where a major compression was in uniform bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9412)|
| 2:36:59| What we found was in that middle rank of individuals as we moved, as Mr. Bray said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9419)|
| 2:37:04| as in the past studies have been done and moved the increase in the entry level for uniform bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9424)|
| 2:37:13| but they did not take into consideration how people move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| And so what you found is that you have all of these individuals that were moving at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| and they compress in the end in the middle ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| And what happens is as the years have gone on, you have increased such a small amount that it forced the compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9445)|
| 2:37:35| What we found for uniform bodies is that we started looking when people start leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| specifically with uniform bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| And when we found, you're going to have to do something with your mid-ranking individuals, as we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9463)|
| 2:37:50| You have to do something with them because if you don't, what you have is a group of individuals that will start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9470)|
| 2:37:56| but they're not going to stay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| And if you don't have those individuals to stay, you're going to have major problems as you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| When you look at the 3.5% and the COLA, where you are talking about there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| that is a cost of living adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| And someone indicated, oh, how we do this across the board in 3.5% at $100,000 versus $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9490)|
| 2:38:18| We understand that, but the cost of living adjustment in the 3.5%, we started looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| and MAG's recommendation was because of the cost of inflation in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| And the cost of inflation was at a 6% cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| And their recommendation was at 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| So we are sitting here trying to do our annual adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| We are trying to look at how do you determine that cost of living adjustment and include all of that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9521)|
| 2:38:49| We made the changes in this ordinance as dealing with individuals, or not individuals, with positions-based pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9529)|
| 2:38:58| That is very, very different than when we're talking about the 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| That is a separate piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| And I just need to make sure everyone understands, and Councilwoman McKenzie talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| We are trying, if we want to be a city of choice and an employer of choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| you have to consider how do you adjust base pay, but you also have to be an employer of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9557)|
| 2:39:25| because you have individuals in high-level positions that people want, and they can lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9565)|
| 2:39:32| They can lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| And so you want to maintain these high individuals that have come into the city with different abilities and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9574)|
| 2:39:43| You want to consider them as much as you want to consider the lowest-paid individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9583)|
| 2:39:50| And our biggest adjustment in this structure was with those lowest-paid individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9590)|
| 2:39:56| By and large, the majority of the major changes went to law enforcement and to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9596)|
| 2:40:03| There are minimal adjustments, and we can look at that individually and do a cost comparison if you want to look at what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9603)|
| 2:40:11| but that's what this ordinance is doing, to be able to help you all to be an employer of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9611)|
| 2:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9619)|

| 2:41:18| Ms. Scheip, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| You have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9681)|
| 2:41:33| Good evening, Vivian Scheip, 3615 Martin Luther King Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9693)|
| 2:41:40| Tonight at 10 p.m., a travesty will once again play out at the entrance to I-40 at Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9700)|
| 2:41:48| Like a recurring nightmare from which one cannot awaken, a Greyhound bus will pull up with passengers coming home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9708)|
| 2:41:56| or exchanging buses in the great city of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9716)|
| 2:42:01| The number nine most desired place to move to in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9721)|
| 2:42:07| They will step off of that bus into a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| Imagine having ridden a bus for almost 10 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| You need to use the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| You need food, and man, are you thirsty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| Some are very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| Some are young and traveling alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| Some are blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| All are about to be shocked and distraught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| For in Knoxville, Tennessee, they have stepped off the bus into a dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9753)|
| 2:42:41| No shelter, no bathroom, not even a drink of water is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| A phone call to the leadership reveals that this is a private company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| but as the citizens of Knoxville keep coming out night after night to bring water and food to those waiting in the midnight hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9770)|
| 2:42:59| the question arises, how many of our leaders, knowing of the situation between 10 p.m. and sunrise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9779)|
| 2:43:06| have been down to see for themselves what is happening on the backside of the marathon station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9786)|
| 2:43:13| Yes, everyone knows full well the business side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| We know all about other cities, but this is Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| in the top 10 of the most desirable places to live in all of these United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9801)|
| 2:43:29| What about the moral side of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9809)|
| 2:43:33| What about the moral responsibility as a leader of showing concern for the common good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| Here, right now, is the perfect time to set an example for others by speaking up and out about the wrongness of this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9819)|
| 2:43:53| To be the good Samaritan, to bring to your fellow council members solutions to help those lying on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9833)|
| 2:44:02| while you are working to move the site to a safer, more humane location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| So tonight, I bring to you a charge, one that you will not answer to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| one that you will not answer to those that you were elected to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| but one you will answer when you leave this physical plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| You are our leaders, and heavy lies the head that wears the crown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9862)|
| 2:44:28| As a leader, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to respect and value the dignity and rights of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9868)|
| 2:44:38| Collectively as a body, you will make a decision by your actions or your non-action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| as to how you will handle the Greyhound situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| But individually, you will have to give an accounting of your nay or your yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9887)|
| 2:44:53| Let Matthew 25, verse 40 be your guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9898)|
| 2:45:01| Next person signed up to speak is Vicki Newbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| Sorry if I mispronounced your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9905)|
| 2:45:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| Can someone help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9913)|
| 2:45:39| This way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9939)|
| 2:45:53| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| Thank you for this opportunity to speak at this public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9954)|
| 2:45:59| And, yes, I will be speaking on the Greyhound situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| In 1993, I lost all of my eyesight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9964)|
| 2:46:11| I lost my confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| I lost my independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| I lost my security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| I was afraid to walk from my door to my mailbox and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9979)|
| 2:46:28| But through a lot of hard work and training, I overcame this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9988)|
| 2:46:34| I not only learned how to walk to the mailbox, I learned how to walk and cross six lanes of busy traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=9994)|
| 2:46:43| Now, I am on the board of the National Federation of the Blind of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10003)|
| 2:46:52| And our goal is to help and improve and help other blind people live the lives that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10012)|
| 2:47:00| Greyhound has been a vital part of the work that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10020)|
| 2:47:08| My grandchildren and my daughter also live in Jackson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10028)|
| 2:47:14| And I honestly think I heard about this before the city even knew about what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10034)|
| 2:47:22| And now I, again, have lost my independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10042)|
| 2:47:34| Used to, I would take the cat lift to the Greyhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10054)|
| 2:47:39| I've been all over this great state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| I've been to D.C. to work on legislation for blind people and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10061)|
| 2:47:48| And I did it independently and securely and safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10068)|
| 2:47:56| Now, as far as this, you know, the Greyhound goes, my independence is gone on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10076)|
| 2:48:04| I no longer am independent to get to the Greyhound station and be secure while I wait there for my bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10084)|
| 2:48:14| I don't know if someone approaching me is offering help or if they want to steal my suitcase or if they want to hurt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10094)|
| 2:48:25| Losing your security and your independence is one of the worst things that can happen to a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10105)|
| 2:48:35| And I'm putting my trust and my faith in our mayors and our city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10115)|
| 2:48:45| And I already know I don't have to worry as much on safety because Knoxville has volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10125)|
| 2:48:56| But on an economic level, our law enforcement has stepped up and, you know, they're watching that area closer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10136)|
| 2:49:08| But it's the responsibility of Greyhound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| And they're doing the job that Greyhound should be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10152)|
| 2:49:20| So just please, for the sake of everyone in our city, so we can all keep doing what we need to do to live the life that we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10160)|
| 2:49:38| and to be a valid part and an active part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10178)|
| 2:49:45| Through the National Federation of the Blind of Tennessee, I please do everything and anything that you can possibly do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10185)|
| 2:49:59| to resolve this issue in a very timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| The last person signed up to speak at public forum is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10212)|
| 2:50:22| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| I really don't have much to say after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| I'll go back to something that you kind of brought up, Councilman Breider, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10230)|
| 2:50:39| About 2000, year 2000, I got involved with the Empowerment Zone process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| And I ended up being the chairman of the East Zone Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10243)|
| 2:50:47| And that process involved federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10247)|
| 2:50:52| Federal dollars that ended up flowing through the city of Knoxville, Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10252)|
| 2:50:57| They contracted out with, I think, Center for Neighborhood Development and Partnership for Neighborhood Improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| Eventually, Partnership for Neighborhood Improvement was the only entity that we were dealing with as a representative for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10262)|
| 2:51:11| Lots of money was promised to come to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220503?start=10271)|
