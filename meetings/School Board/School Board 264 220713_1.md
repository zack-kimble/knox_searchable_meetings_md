| 2:41:22| Giving fake state codes or quoting laws that don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| As elected officials, you're the voice of the parents and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9685)|

| 2:41:30| So today I'm asking you to create a policy that will require all Knox County administrators to give families all of the information they need to make the best decisions for their students in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9690)|
| 2:41:39| Families shouldn't have to file an open records request just to know what programs are offered in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9699)|

| 2:41:51| They shouldn't have to wait for eight months just to give a state code that has nothing to do with the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9711)|
| 2:41:56| It should be given at the school level with an honest and complete information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9716)|
