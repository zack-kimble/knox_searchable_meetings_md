| 2:14:06| Let me bring this back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| Let me reel this back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Councilman Starr, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| So that was going to be one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Does the administration have an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| And then number two, and I probably should know the answer to this, what do we do for comp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| Do we self-insure up to a certain amount or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| Yeah, we do self-insure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| And does the administration have a position on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| I mean, right now, I think our, you know, well, we're still talking about the disability issue right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| We prefer it, I think, to stay in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| And pretty much we were assuming it would stay as it was right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| I couldn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| We haven't looked at the various alternatives to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| Real quick, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| Is it possible for someone in your office to explore the cost of private insurance just as a matter of comparison or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8091)|
| 2:14:59| I mean, the short answer is it's going to cost, generally speaking, relatively more outside the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8099)|
| 2:15:05| And the people, the reason people go outside the plan is not to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| The reason they go outside the plan is so they don't have to make the determination of who's disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| So if the significant issue is making the determination, then that may make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| If the issue is more cost, then it probably makes more sense to leave it in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| Who makes the determination now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| Is Mr. Cherry here or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| Pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| Pension board decides if someone is permanently disabled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Is that what you decide as opposed to just disabled for a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| Well, I think Mr. Cherry could address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| But that's one of the issues if you go to pension board meetings and look at the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| that a lot of it is that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| So the question here is do we want to adopt this new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| And I'm going to assume that if it was voted down, then that defaults back to what is currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8148)|
| 2:16:00| So you're saying leave what is currently in the existing plan and the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| Put that in the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Fifty percent of pay in one case and the accumulated benefit approach in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| If I could make one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| My recommendation was a recommendation on the presumption that there was a desire for cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| I've heard more than one comment to say that there's not a desire to mess with that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| You know, I don't have any objection to using the current benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| And if it's the desire of the council to vote on that up or down, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| I don't want to hamper that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Yeah, well, as I say, if this was to not be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| then the default is that the current plan would be entered into the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8204)|
| 2:16:51| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| I was just going to say I think the most important thing is that we be sure that we take care of our disabled employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| However, this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| That's a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| Are we comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| What are we voting on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| I want to be real clear on which way I'm going to go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| Exactly what is the question on which we are voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| The recommendation that has been brought forth by Mr. Pennington as opposed to the current plan that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8240)|
| 2:17:30| And if you want him to paraphrase or just summarize, well, I mean, it's just the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8250)|
| 2:17:37| So if we accept his recommendation, we would vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| If we reject his recommendation, we will vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| I will vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8268)|

| 2:17:51| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8271)|

| 2:17:54| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| Councilman Dela Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| Praise the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8291)|
| 2:18:20| I believe that's the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| That is the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| Congratulations, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| So are we, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| At this point, we can have Mr. Gilbert and Bill Mason, who is the attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| helping us begin to prepare all of these items in this list to make them ballot ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| Is that our understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| Councilman Dela Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| I wonder if to revisit the now amended DBDC max lever plan or whatever we call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8332)|
| 2:19:01| and compare it to the defined contribution plan and see if we're still here on this plan as we have defined it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| because half of the comments made during the meeting were, well, I'm voting on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| but I'm not in favor of it kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| And, you know, I don't know if we know where we are, but I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| But I don't know if we know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| I wonder if we should just be sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| Before you take that issue, could I take two minutes and run down what I believe everybody accepted and let you confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8359)|
| 2:19:26| Summarize what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| Make sure that we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| And make sure that I heard what I think I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| Item number one, $40,000 break point was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Item number two, the indexing was approved with the additional amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| that it should not increase beyond the average pay of the general government fire and police employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| Item three, interest crediting rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| that such accounts shall be credited with whatever rate is earned on the fund was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| The normal retirement age, 63 with 10 years of service for the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8402)|
| 2:20:08| 56 with 25 years of service for the fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8408)|
| 2:20:14| with fire and police retirement age also not to be later than 62 and 10 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8414)|
| 2:20:22| Item five, contribution credits, 6% employee contribution, 8% general government, 10% fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8422)|
| 2:20:33| Cost of living, we just went through that, so I won't restate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| But as the recommendation was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| The partial lump sum such that the lump sum may be offered up to 10% was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8439)|
| 2:20:48| Out of duty was rejected in favor of the current provision staying as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8448)|
| 2:20:54| Early retirement was accepted as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| Termination prior to normal retirement was accepted as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| Optional forms, normal retirement, I believe the rest of the items were accepted as they were recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Everybody okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| On the cola, below 60% funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8472)|
| 2:21:22| That's right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| Okay, you got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8488)|

| 2:21:30| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| You've just been a wealth of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| You've had a tough job, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| No, truly it's been a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| I really appreciate the opportunity to work with the council as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| and with the individual council members that I've had the opportunity to work with as well as the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| So it truly it's been interesting, challenging, but it really has been very satisfying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| and I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| Are we going to do what Mr. Delvaux recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8518)|
| 2:22:05| Well, I guess if that's the will of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| I really feel like that we've got to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| I mean, I don't know what the rest of the council feels like, but I'll acknowledge some lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8534)|
| 2:22:22| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| I'm not in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| I think where we should just me personally, I'm comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| I think we should move forward with all this hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| I mean, we have vetted this I think as much as we can vet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| And I'm comfortable where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8556)|
| 2:22:37| And I want to move forward as we plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| I also would like to move forward with what we have decided the work we've put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| and get something to go to the voters and let the voters speak up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| I don't see any real value for our hashing this out again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8573)|
| 2:23:01| I think that everybody pretty well knows where everybody stands or what they're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8581)|
| 2:23:06| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| Well, I want to thank you, Vice Mayor, for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| You've shown through this ongoing process and Mr. Pennington and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8590)|
| 2:23:16| I want to ask a question about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| Once this goes and Dr. Lyons said they will take this to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| will it then come back to the council for our we'll be able to change a vote or tweak anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| Or that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| When it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| I'd recognize Mr. Gilbert on that perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| I think he'd be much better qualified to answer that than I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Bud Gilbert, General of Montgomery and Finley General Counsel to the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| 550 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| Charter Section 1355, which was added in 2006 referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| and, of course, approved by the city council, what we call the Charter Protection Provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| says that at least 60 days before council considers this ordinance on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| which is June the 21st is the deadline, the language has to be filed in the pension board office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| Once that proposed ordinance is filed in the pension board office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| the pension board has 60 days to review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| and issue a report to city council as to the form and effect of the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| and any recommended changes to protect the qualified status of this governmental pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| It goes back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| And then I don't have the schedule right in front of me, but if the last date is June the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8687)|
| 2:24:55| I think you have an error margin on three different council meetings in order to get this passed on a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8695)|
| 2:25:01| and second reading before it has to be published 60 days in the newspaper prior to the November 6, 2012 referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8701)|
| 2:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| I'm good with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| I'm fine to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| I think we've worked hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| I want to bring up and I don't know how to get this on discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8722)|
| 2:25:30| I'm still a proponent of a ballot amendment that would remove the pension from underneath the guidance of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8730)|
| 2:25:39| And I don't know how to get that on to discussion and how to get that on possibly on to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8739)|
| 2:25:46| Well, it's a totally go ahead, Mr. Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8749)|
| 2:25:50| I think it's a totally different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| I refer to that as de-chartering the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| And essentially it would be an ordinance that says shall Article 13 of the charter containing the actual terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8757)|
| 2:26:06| and provisions of the existing plans be deleted from the charter and recodified in a written pension plan document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8766)|
| 2:26:15| that is maintained by city council via ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| But it's a separate question from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| That is entirely a separate issue than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| The obvious political concern for any member of council is whether that scares employee groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8787)|
| 2:26:35| whether they think that is a dangerous move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| It has nothing to do with the Blackwell protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| Blackwell still applies whether the provisions of the pension plan are in the charter or in a separately stated document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8802)|
| 2:26:50| Well, it has everything to do with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| You're putting this plan back in and we can either decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| I think it has everything to do with where we are because it has the oversight of the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| that we're working on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| And you're putting it back into the charter under the same restrictions that you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8823)|
| 2:27:09| Same pension board and same, you know, same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| I mean, I don't know how to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| I'm trying to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| I don't know how to bring it up, whether I bring it up at council or bring it up here or we have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| or maybe there's nobody else interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| But I just think it's very cumbersome when you've got to make changes like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8841)|
| 2:27:28| and you're stacked up against all these deadlines and we rush, rush, rush to all these meetings to try to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| you know, before the pension board to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| And I think it would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| It was certainly the power would be right here at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| And then you'd have control of the pension board or at least some appointments to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| So I don't know how to do it, but that's something for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| My only point is it's separate from what we've been discussing these last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8871)|
| 2:27:57| Oh, yeah, it's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| But, I mean, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| I understand it's pertinent, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| And I would just direct you to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| And he can, I'm sure, can give you guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| The reason I mentioned what I did a while back here was the notion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8893)|
| 2:28:20| we, I think, all seriously worked very hard on looking at a pension plan that divides risk between the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8900)|
| 2:28:29| and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8909)|
| 2:28:29| We looked at the various levers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| Alan has been really helpful in trying to help us analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| And we've looked at a ton of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| And I think that this is a good plan in terms of sharing risk and in terms of market risk between the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8919)|
| 2:28:51| and the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| But there still remains a question in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| And I think it's a significant one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| And I think that it was alluded to in part by what Marshall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| And that was the current generation of young people are more mobile than their predecessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8941)|
| 2:29:09| And in having a plan that actually is yours is a value for attracting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8949)|
| 2:29:16| Now, maybe that's a detraction for them staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| I don't know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| I don't know that we have any information before us one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8961)|
| 2:29:25| But the thing that is certain going beyond that question of is it a better tool to recruit or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| the thing that goes beyond that is a defined contribution plan has the city generously put forward dollars into an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8971)|
| 2:29:40| account along with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| The city is going to put in more than the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| And the city has fiscal control of its future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| And that's the part that worries me the most still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| As good as this effort has been to try to look at the various pieces of this and make it an effective whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=8991)|
| 2:30:01| there is still that element of the unknown that Europe blows up like it seems to be doing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| or the economy tanks for some reason that we don't anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9007)|
| 2:30:12| And we bear a financial risk outside of the scope of what we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9012)|
| 2:30:19| And so the defined contribution plan has some downside, I suppose, in the sense of is it an incentive to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9019)|
| 2:30:27| until you're 56 or 63 or whatever the years that we talked about were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| But the positive side is that it's your money in a pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9032)|
| 2:30:37| It is what most of the taxpayers are living with personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| And when there is a down year, they suffer it and no one bails them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| And as a council who's charged with the fiscal responsibility for this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9045)|
| 2:30:52| it's certainly a tool that is more finite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| You can get your arms around it fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| You've committed not just to pay your employees X dollars but 109% of the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| because you're putting 8% and 10% in the different pots that we're creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| So that aspect still comes back to sort of haunt me a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| I mean, I was very much committed to us looking at this, seeing if we could work on the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9075)|
| 2:31:21| And I think that was Mr. Wallace's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| And, again, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| Good employees are our only real tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| We don't market a product other than service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| And service comes from employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| On the other hand, managing costs in a world that could get tougher as we decline in the rise of China| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9095)|
| 2:31:45| and, I don't know, maybe lose 30% of the marketplace if Europe goes down the toilet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| And the question is, will the taxpayers understand a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9110)|
| 2:31:57| Yes, they live with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| Most of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| And, two, will this city have a certain amount of fiscal certainty if they go that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9120)|
| 2:32:07| Maybe the answer is that we're still where we were last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| or two weeks ago when we were tackling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| But I wonder if it isn't prudent to just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| Now that we've seen sort of the inside of the store, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| And do we want to take another non-binding straw poll to just examine, are we going charging forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| Because if we are, then Bud's got to write up stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| We've got to second-guess him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| The law department will be working with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| We're going to want to probably talk to Mr. Cherry and his crew about various pieces of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| And I think we should just take our own temperature before we adjourn for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9156)|
| 2:32:44| Given what Councilman De La Vope said and the fact that we haven't heard from Councilman Kampen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| I think we certainly don't really know where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| I don't know how we can, after what he said, to really say we know exactly where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| And here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| You know, I think we had our first meeting April 9th or April 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9182)|
| 2:33:08| And it's May 14th, so it's a month and five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| We have to get this to them before June 21st, which is about another, it's almost like we're at the halfway point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| Then they look at it for 60 days, and then we'll have to really vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| So my fear is that if we just send the hybrid plan, you know, I don't know where everybody's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9203)|
| 2:33:30| It doesn't seem like it's really set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| Then they could come back, and then we're really stuck with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| And people may have changed, and we may not have the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| So I guess my question is maybe we should have a meeting like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| and create a defined contribution plan and send both plans to the pension board and have them sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9224)|
| 2:33:52| And that way when we vote on this in August, we'll have real options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| And, you know, and if it was clear, you know, if it was clear, I wouldn't be saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| But it's certainly not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| I mean, there's only, from what I can see, there's only four votes for this hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| And you all may change over the course of, you know, we're talking months, three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| So is that even, is that possible to send two proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| I mean, I looked at the charter today, and it doesn't, there's no limit on the number that we can send for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9259)|
| 2:34:29| Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| Well, I would say the procedure we envisioned, and I think we discussed before, was having a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9271)|
| 2:34:37| It's not required, I think, but a resolution prior to sending whatever to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9277)|
| 2:34:42| and having it come back at some point prior to that where council would express its preference to send one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9282)|
| 2:34:49| I would just say in the discussion tonight, not to reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| I guess we are reopening all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| We're getting away from the fact that what we had was always a given that there was some market risk in the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9294)|
| 2:35:03| much reduced, much attenuated, versus, and this is what's not been discussed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| that was discussed last time that led to the straw poll that we had last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| which is versus all the impact on the personnel program of the city, its human resources program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| And, I mean, it's like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| I think that is something we have to keep in mind as we discuss this in a holistic manner and not get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9320)|
| 2:35:28| again, I don't think if we want zero market risk in the defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| and then risking all the things that we don't know, which are unknowns, that we talked about last time in recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| and retention and, again, the major difference between public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9340)|
| 2:35:44| and private employees, all of those factors, I would just urge everybody to remember those as you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| because they're still relevant tonight just as they were last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| And that being we don't know about having people who have a defined contribution only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9354)|
| 2:36:00| and then feel unable to retire in fire and police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| and other major physically demanding jobs that we all rely on in a civil service atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| where they can hang on indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| I mean, there are many, many issues there that are just as unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| and I think are much more threatening to the well-being of the city than purely the market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| That's the balance which led to the straw poll last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9383)|
| 2:36:24| This then has taken the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| We fleshed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| We put in the levers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| We put in the protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| So, I guess I'm somewhat quizzical and I'm sure the mayor had to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| but I know she would be as to why we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| why we would eliminate those other considerations from our consideration tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| And I don't think anybody wants to stay and rehash that debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| I think we've had that discussion ad nauseum probably, if not ad infinitum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9404)|
| 2:36:48| almost over the past number of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| So, I would just make that statement that our presumption was council would take a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| We prepare this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| There would be a one plan sent to the pension board, possibly by resolution of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9417)|
| 2:37:03| where the will of council was expressed that would then be prepared, as Mr. Gilbert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| to come back to council for final considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Meantime, the public could become comfortable with what was out there, educated on what was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| because this is a critical vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| And I'll add one final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| If this critical vote fails, you've got what we have now, which we all know is much more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9437)|
| 2:37:23| has all the risk on the city, is unsustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| So, I would just end with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| I think that Mayor Guerrero feels very strongly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9449)|
| 2:37:32| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| Just to comment, I think last at our last workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| I believe Councilman Greve asked that very question about whether or not we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| or would it be a good idea to send two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| Didn't you ask that last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| On the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| On the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| And I was glad you asked it because I was wondering about it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| But I think last week at our discussion it was decided, or maybe not decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9476)|
| 2:38:03| that it would be a little less cumbersome to the voters if they had the one plan to vote on, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9483)|
| 2:38:12| But I know that Councilman Greve brought that up last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9492)|
| 2:38:21| Real briefly, I just heard Bill Lyons give all the reasons why the hybrid that we've been working on to make good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9501)|
| 2:38:29| should be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9509)|
| 2:38:30| But, again, all we had was a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| It's not a binding poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| And now that we've seen the inside of the elephant, I think we ought to make sure that we're going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9514)|
| 2:38:40| And if the answer is yes, we're going here, let's go full speed ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| And let's get the lawyers doing their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| And let's get the resolutions going and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9526)|
| 2:38:49| But the straw poll wasn't a final poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| I think we need to be sure that we're going where we think we're going and we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| Let's take a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9537)|
| 2:38:58| Mr. Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| I mean, if we're going to have it as a resolution, if we're going to have it as a resolution, should we just vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9541)|
| 2:39:08| Because Councilman DellaVolpe's point is it's a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| It's a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| So if we had it as a resolution in two weeks, I guess from tomorrow, then that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9552)|
| 2:39:21| I mean, I do have a general concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| I think Councilman DellaVolpe can change a couple of times during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| So over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| I think that's what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9571)|
| 2:39:32| I don't see anybody else that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| But when you only have five votes and one changes, that does change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9574)|
| 2:39:39| So I would hate to realize that in August, that the plan that's been reviewed for two months by the pension board doesn't have the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9579)|
| 2:39:48| So that's why I proposed two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| That way we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| I mean, I think one of them would pass in August when we vote on this for real, no straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9593)|
| 2:40:03| That's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| And then that gives us more time to hear from the employees and more time to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9611)|
| 2:40:12| Vice Mayor, would it be appropriate to have an official vote tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| That would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9618)|
| 2:40:19| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| We just have a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| That's all we can do this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9624)|
| 2:40:25| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| My light's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9627)|
| 2:40:28| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| I understand that this is extremely complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9632)|
| 2:40:38| My question is, if we wait until some kind of resolution comes to council, what happens to the prep time that is needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9638)|
| 2:40:48| work on the language of the charter amendment that's going to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9648)|
| 2:40:57| then back to council, and then ultimately to the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| Our assumption, if I could answer that, is very much we would like a straw poll tonight, as has been suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9661)|
| 2:41:07| so that folks can get to work on that resolution, on that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| It could later formally be sent by resolution or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| That was just one avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| It's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9677)|
| 2:41:18| But I think, you know, the sooner the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| Now, here it is in almost the middle of May, and we've got until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| The folks need to start working on this with clear direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| So we would --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| I think a straw poll would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| Well, I never wanted to be rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| I mean, really, this is a huge deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| And we can take straw polls until the cows come home, and it's not a binding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| I mean, I like what we've worked on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| I think that's great, what we've whittled to this hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| But if, you know, unless it's a huge burden to go forward with, you know, Marshall's idea, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9710)|
| 2:41:58| just to have that one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| And I don't even recall exactly what the other than, you know, the mayor's administration's response was about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9721)|
| 2:42:10| you know, putting, I guess, like you said, Councilman Brown, the cumbersome nature of putting both on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9730)|
| 2:42:17| you know, letting the voters decide one way or the other, which, you know, it's either this or it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| Maybe that's too much for the voters to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| I don't think they're ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| The questions have to be yes, no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| So to have two, you could risk having no pension plan, both lost, or two conflicting pension plans approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9752)|
| 2:42:40| There really has to be one clear pension change item on the ballot in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9760)|
| 2:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| If I could just say, I think he's right that one question is clearer, but I disagree to some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9768)|
| 2:42:57| and that is that you could have a statement that says, we're proposing to close the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9777)|
| 2:43:04| the current defined benefit plan, and we're asking you to select either A, a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9784)|
| 2:43:13| or B, a hybrid plan, both of which have been vetted by your council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| I mean, they can say yes to A or yes to B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| We've got the attorneys shaking their heads over here going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| Only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| A question has to have a yes, no answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| It can't be framed any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| It can't be an if, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| And all the more reason why we should know where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| I also agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| The thing that one of the things that troubles me the most is that, and I don't know about my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9821)|
| 2:43:46| but the number of people who have talked to me, I'm talking about our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| I'm talking about the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| The one thing that they keep saying to me is, you're not making any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9833)|
| 2:43:59| What you're doing is you're still having a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| I mean, excuse me, a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| And, you know, I deal with an awful lot of contractors and subcontractors, a lot of people out there that are scratching by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9846)|
| 2:44:14| And I'm just not sure that, and I don't know how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9854)|
| 2:44:19| Apparently we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9859)|
| 2:44:20| What I'm concerned about is that what we're coming up with we're not going to be able to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| and it's not going to pass because the perception is that it's much like what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9863)|
| 2:44:29| And so that's where I think there's a major problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9869)|
| 2:44:33| And there's a major problem that, you know, we need to get a feel for the taxpayer in terms of what they're going to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9873)|
| 2:44:40| So I think that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| And I'll disagree because I've been very ably been able to communicate the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9882)|
| 2:44:48| and they're significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| And I think it's a disservice if we don't move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9890)|
| 2:44:54| I mean, this is we're a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| We're not a 12-week cycle report to Wall Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| I mean, the people that I represent want good services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| And the only way we can do that, like Councilman Wallace alluded to, is if we've got a good product and that's our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| And that's all we're selling here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| And it's, you know, it's tremendously been reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| The risk, the employees are having to invest greater amounts of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9917)|
| 2:45:24| and they've come with their hat in their hand, basically, and said, we know there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| And we're willing, we're willing to, you know, make these changes for the next people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| And, you know, the ones that I'm talking to, I'm expressing the differences, and I think they're vast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9934)|
| 2:45:41| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Well, I agree, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| I mean, I've had no problem communicating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9944)|
| 2:45:48| Anybody who wants to listen, these are huge changes what we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| You're putting, you have really changed the way the employees are going to face their pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9952)|
| 2:46:00| And that's very easy to distinguish, and that's very easy to communicate to constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| Anybody who wants to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Now, the problem is they don't care much past about 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9966)|
| 2:46:12| But it's very easy to, I've not had any resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9972)|
| 2:46:16| Yes, we're making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| We're making huge changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| You're pushing the risk over to the employee half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| They have zero now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| So we've increased their risk by a tremendous amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| And we've cut their benefits by a tremendous amount over their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| But nothing's going to fix the plan you have now, and we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| And it's not 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| We're not guaranteeing them 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| We're guaranteeing them 24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| It's a huge difference of where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| And you've asked the employees to do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| Is there a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| Will there be a time in the future where employees want to be, as Mr. Stare says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| that they want to be mobile and change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| They may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| And it may push it to a city council out there in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10015)|
| 2:46:59| But we've got to make the decision what's best right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| And given the employees that you have, given the management style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| and how you're going to deal with that, you have no plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| Defined contribution, you know, defined contribution, you don't have a plan for how you're going to interact with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| and how that's going to impact your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| You can't take that big a risk and change it all at once with 1,500 employees, given where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10037)|
| 2:47:25| This is a logical step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| It's a big step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| It's a gradual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10049)|
| 2:47:30| Does it mean in ten years or sometime in the future you're going to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10050)|
| 2:47:34| and go all defined contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10054)|
| 2:47:37| You very well may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| And it doesn't limit us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| But the risk of changing that all at once, given where you are, is I think it's inconceivable to manage through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10060)|
| 2:47:48| I've got employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| I've got sales people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| I've got compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| You make a strong change, a radical change in the middle of something, you're creating quite a bit of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10073)|
| 2:48:01| And that's what employees are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10081)|
| 2:48:02| You're here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| You're here to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| And people that might complain, well, I only have defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| I only have defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| But they're not working for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| And they're not working for a government, you know, employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| So it's far, far different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| They're not putting their lives at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| My employees aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| So I think that you've got to be cautious, and I think this is a very logical step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| If you want to do a straw poll, we've got to get to some consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| When we vote on this, we've got to go out there in the marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| and convince the constituents that this is the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| It will not work if this is a divided council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| We have got to step out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| When we vote, we've got to step out and we're unified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10124)|
| 2:48:47| And whether you agree with it or not, personally, we're voting as a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| And we've got to move into the marketplace and say why we think this is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| If you get out there and say, well, I didn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| I don't think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| If you don't have a unified contribution, yeah, you're going to undermine the effects of what we've spent this time working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10140)|
| 2:49:06| We're here as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10146)|
| 2:49:07| We're here as one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10147)|
| 2:49:08| And we've got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10148)|
| 2:49:09| And we've got to be unified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| And I think we're making, if we come here and split and everything's split and we come here 4-4 in a pass, guys, we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10151)|
| 2:49:19| you know, we've wasted a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| And if we wait and vote on it in August and you want to risk it until August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| what I'm saying is this is what, this is the best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| I'm not willing to risk waiting all the way to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| Philosophically, I'm not going to change my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| Because I, a numbers game, yes, it's the greatest thing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| Got to find a contribution and take all the risk out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| But for the employees and for the benefit of the city long term, it's a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10182)|
| 2:49:46| And so, I mean, I've come to grips with it philosophically, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| and we've been prudent business people to look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| That's Wilma Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| I have two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| One is that many of our employees are vested taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10198)|
| 2:50:02| They're vested in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| They're also taxpayers in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| We have had members of the community come and speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| I have had people and maybe my constituency, particularly in my district, may not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10209)|
| 2:50:16| may be in a spot to better understand the two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| But I think there's another point that we all need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| When Madeline Rojero was elected mayor last November, she had an incredible mandate from the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10224)|
| 2:50:32| The voters of this city spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| They put their confidence in her to be our leader for the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10234)|
| 2:50:40| She got a mandate far greater than any person sitting on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| And I think that as a council, we need to listen to that mandate the voters gave her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10245)|
| 2:50:51| She had confidence in her ability and her decision-making and her leadership of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10251)|
| 2:50:58| And I think that if this council does not support her hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| and particularly with the things we've done tonight and the revisions that are in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| then we're basically saying to the voters, well, you didn't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| We don't have to listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| And I think that we do need to listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| And I think there was a real clear mandate in electing Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| It was a plan that she thinks would best benefit the services that we provide to the voters, the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10278)|
| 2:51:26| And that is what we are, is a service business where we like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10286)|
| 2:51:31| People want their garbage picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| They want their streets paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| They want to feel safe in their homes and their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| And anything that we do that jeopardizes that means that as council members, we have been very derelict in our duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10298)|
| 2:51:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| Mr. Sonner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10308)|
| 2:51:49| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| Earlier, I made some remarks, and I'm not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| And I think that's well known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| Nevertheless, we have been through a process that's been very rigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| And tonight we put some meat on these bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10322)|
| 2:52:06| I had prepared myself to then take that step that Councilman Wallace mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10326)|
| 2:52:12| and get behind this and see it all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| And I think we need to quit second-guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| I thought we had put that item to bed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| While I did not agree with the vote, I accepted it and it moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| And I know it's not a binding vote, but I just want to move on with this and go ahead and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10348)|
| 2:52:35| We do have a timeline, and it's fairly short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| We do not have until June the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| There is a prep time that our lawyers must have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| So I think we need to put whatever we can to bed tonight and give them the proper time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10364)|
| 2:52:51| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| Well, I mean, just on a couple different issues, I mean, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| I certainly understand where you all come from, and I think you know where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10378)|
| 2:53:03| The problem is, I mean, I don't count to an easy five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| And we've still got the problem of three months down the road of when we're actually going to be taking the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| That's my concern, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| And I certainly have all the respect in the world for the mayor, but, I mean, that wasn't a central campaign issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10395)|
| 2:53:22| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10402)|
| 2:53:23| I mean, it was an issue, but, I mean, there wasn't hybrid versus one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| I don't think you can say that that's what the voters want just because they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| overwhelmingly supported her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| You know, the problem is we don't have, you know, five firmly committed one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| I mean, is that not the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10423)|
| 2:53:45| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10425)|
| 2:53:46| We don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10426)|
| 2:53:47| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10427)|
| 2:53:48| I think we've got five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Should we do a straw poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10430)|
| 2:53:51| Or, I mean, I don't want to keep beating a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| I think it's answering the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| I didn't mean to want to beat a dead horse, but it's just Councilman De La Vope sort of talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| I'm a live horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| Oh, thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10444)|
| 2:54:05| Bishop, quickly, either Mr. Pennington or Dr. Lyons, do you all have any concluding remarks before I call for this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10445)|
| 2:54:15| I think we would prefer a straw poll that gave firm guidance tonight to folks to begin working on one plan to take forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10455)|
| 2:54:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Thank you, Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| I was just going to say I really appreciate all the work that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| And I think it would be a shame if we ended up putting a 401K with a lot of dissension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| It didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10471)|
| 2:54:31| Then we ended up with the same plan that we've got now, and we haven't made any progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| Very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| Well, and I also want to reiterate something that Councilman Wallace said a moment ago, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10478)|
| 2:54:43| This probably will not be our only visitation with pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| I think we're going to have other opportunities as we move on through the next two, four, six, eight years, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10488)|
| 2:54:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Ms. Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10498)|
| 2:54:58| Well, we're voting on whether, yes, just as we did last time, this hybrid plan or contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10498)|
| 2:55:12| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| Uncomfortably hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10524)|
| 2:55:25| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| Councilman Kampen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10530)|
| 2:55:31| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10545)|
| 2:55:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| We have two folks that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10554)|
| 2:55:57| And first is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| I feel like you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10559)|
| 2:56:06| You have five minutes if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| Anita Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee, representing the general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10569)|
| 2:56:16| Members of council, Vice Mayor Pavlis, I want to thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10576)|
| 2:56:21| Councilman Wallace, Councilman Brown, Councilwoman Palmer, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10581)|
| 2:56:30| I believe you all get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| You all, all of you, were elected to represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| And as Councilwoman Palmer said a little bit ago, not everybody lives in Lenore City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10597)|
| 2:56:43| and not every city employee lives outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| I respected what you said, Councilman, Vice Mayor Pavlis, when you said that we had met and we had talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10607)|
| 2:56:53| and we just about beat this to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10615)|
| 2:56:56| We have met and met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| And we've talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10618)|
| 2:56:59| And we've talked behind the scenes many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| And we've taken one straw poll and we moved forward with this, taking you at your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10622)|
| 2:57:07| And I'm glad to see that the straw poll tonight even more definitely shows that we are moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10627)|
| 2:57:14| I just want to express to you, and this is Councilman Wallace, you are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10634)|
| 2:57:21| We are giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| We realize there is a significant problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| And we have given and we have given and we have given, not just general government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10646)|
| 2:57:32| but all employees have given because we wanted to lessen the risk to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10652)|
| 2:57:40| So, to say that there's not significant changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| and I agree with you, anybody that wants to understand it can understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10663)|
| 2:57:46| But most of them don't want to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10666)|
| 2:57:51| And I just want to thank you for your diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| And I did want to say that we have and we will continue to give to do what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10673)|
| 2:57:58| We're not a defined contribution employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| Joel Gautreau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10685)|
| 2:58:09| I hope I didn't botch that too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| Joel Gautreau, 11918 Abner's Ridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| Just wanted to, I'm the Vice President of the Firefighters Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| and I wanted to not go backwards, but I do want to bring up an issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10700)|
| 2:58:24| and discuss something that's significant to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10704)|
| 2:58:29| The drop plan has been eliminated for the future pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10709)|
| 2:58:34| And I've not had anybody be able to explain to me why it has been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10714)|
| 2:58:40| Myself and many other people have addressed the issue of the cost of a drop plan in the retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10720)|
| 2:58:48| No one has been able to define any cost associated with having a drop plan within the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10728)|
| 2:58:55| Basically, in case you don't understand the way the system works, a very quick outline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| the employee signs up on the drop plan after they've achieved their years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| That employee stops the clock on the benefits being accrued on their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10745)|
| 2:59:11| Then they continue to work a two-year time frame that the money that they have contributing to their retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10751)|
| 2:59:19| then goes into a savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| The employee funds that savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| That lump sum that they leave with is funded by the employee, not by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10764)|
| 2:59:31| There have been some people out on the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| and other places that have accused the employees of double dipping the system when they're on the drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10773)|
| 2:59:38| That is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| The employee is funding that lump sum by their own contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10780)|
| 2:59:47| The reason a drop plan is good for the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| and for the department is because it allows them to project and fill vacancies that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10790)|
| 2:59:56| We have three people right now on the fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| We don't have the luxury of just dropping out and trying to fill people that retire on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10800)|
| 3:00:09| We have to be able to project those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| This allows them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| It allows the experienced people to stay and help train the new people that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10814)|
| 3:00:21| Essentially, what you're getting is a 27-year employee for the cost of a 25-year employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10821)|
| 3:00:29| with that experience that you're getting with somebody who's on the drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| It's definitely one of the most important recruitment tools that the fire department specifically has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10833)|
| 3:00:40| I came here from Massachusetts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| It was one of the first things that was described to me as I was entering in to try to get into the city of Knoxville's fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10843)|
| 3:00:51| was the fact that there's a drop plan here that provides a good benefit for the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| but it's a good benefit for the city as well and without cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| I just want that for your consideration as you go forward moving with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10861)|
| 3:01:10| Very quickly, the other thing I want to touch on is the discussions about the shared risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10870)|
| 3:01:16| I just want to make sure that everyone here is aware the employees of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10876)|
| 3:01:22| have contributed their obligated share to the retirement fund as they've been required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10882)|
| 3:01:29| From the date of the inception of this pension system, we have not failed to contribute our share one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10889)|
| 3:01:36| Although I know that past councils and past city administrations, you guys here sitting here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10896)|
| 3:01:44| are not necessarily responsible for their decisions, but from the inception of this pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10904)|
| 3:01:52| the city has failed to contribute upwards of $90 million to the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10912)|
| 3:01:58| So although the employees have contributed our share without fail, the city has failed to contribute their share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10918)|
| 3:02:07| And yet now we're being asked to bear the weight of all the changes so that we can have a sustainable system going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10927)|
| 3:02:18| To me, that's throwing it all on us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| By closing the current system and starting a new system, you're putting the onus on the employees once again to fix the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10943)|
| 3:02:34| that was created essentially by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10954)|
| 3:02:41| If you'll wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10961)|
| 3:02:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| Not just tonight, but in all of these pension workshop meetings, I've seen a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10964)|
| 3:02:50| And they're good questions, but it boils down to true knowledge on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10970)|
| 3:02:55| And I feel like there's just not enough full knowledge on the part of everyone involved in this to be able to just throw a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10975)|
| 3:03:02| system out there and put it to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10982)|
| 3:03:06| And I would just ask the council to kind of put on the brakes a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10986)|
| 3:03:11| No changes are going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| No changes are going to be reflected in this system for upwards of 20 years in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=10993)|
| 3:03:21| If we wait a little more time and let everybody share in the risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=11001)|
| 3:03:26| and share in the benefits and get a proper plan put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| I think that we can more adequately support the plan and we can all move forward together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=11010)|
| 3:03:36| and share the risks and the benefits of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120514?start=11022)|
