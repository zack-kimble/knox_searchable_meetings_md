| 0:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=334.0)|
| 0:05:35| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=335.0)|
| 0:05:36| How's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=336.0)|
| 0:05:37| This a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=337.0)|
| 0:05:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=338.0)|
| 0:05:39| So June 14th, we held our bimonthly Fire and Technical Rescue Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=339.0)|
| 0:05:45| In that meeting, new officers were elected for the upcoming term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=345.0)|
| 0:05:51| Unanimously, Chief Jerry Harnish with Rural Metro was voted the committee chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=351.0)|
| 0:05:56| Chief Darren Long from Carnes was voted the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=356.0)|
| 0:06:00| And Chief John Linsenbigler from Seymour Fire was voted as the finance chair subcommittee, subcommittee for the finance chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=360.0)|
| 0:06:10| We obviously couldn't get out of there without recognizing Mr. Vandeveidt for all the work he's done from the conception of this committee up until last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=370.0)|
| 0:06:21| We appreciate all of his efforts, basically taking this committee from the foundation up and bringing it to where it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=381.0)|
| 0:06:30| And we really appreciate everything he did for us there and he did for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=390.0)|
| 0:06:37| Also, with the retirement of Larry Hutzel as the emergency response coordinator for the health department, Steve Hamby has since filled that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=397.0)|
| 0:06:45| And that is also a position on the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=405.0)|
| 0:06:48| So we're happy to have Steve there and we welcome his input as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=408.0)|
| 0:06:53| At the committee, we presented the CTAS report, which you all got to see, an abbreviated version of what we looked at there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=413.0)|
| 0:07:01| Some 9-1-1 dispatch protocols were gone over for our respective agencies within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=421.0)|
| 0:07:06| And then the advanced NOx presentation was given at that also so we could kind of see where our housing trends and our infrastructure trends were going to go over the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=426.0)|
| 0:07:19| Traditionally, as you guys may know, the north end and west end of the county continue to be the busiest for emergency response calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=439.0)|
| 0:07:29| So far for the last three months, 3,329 calls were medical calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=449.0)|
| 0:07:34| This is countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=454.0)|
| 0:07:36| 260 calls for structure fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=456.0)|
| 0:07:40| And again, as you're aware, those calls are, that's regardless of what is found when the fire department arrives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=460.0)|
| 0:07:47| It could be smoke, it could be fire, it may be something as small, I say small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=467.0)|
| 0:07:53| maybe something as small as maybe just a pot on the stove that got the fire department to the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=473.0)|
| 0:07:59| And then 1,911 of those calls were what we consider other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=479.0)|
| 0:08:05| And that could be lift assist, that could be hazmat, that could be non-emergency calls to check an odor or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=485.0)|
| 0:08:13| So we just classify those as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=493.0)|
| 0:08:17| One of the big things that we're proud of and we're proud of our departments that do on a continual basis is fire public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=497.0)|
| 0:08:25| Especially this time of year with the end of school, the fire safety house is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=505.0)|
| 0:08:30| I was speaking with Captain Bagwell earlier and I see a lot of the posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=510.0)|
| 0:08:35| We're out in subdivisions, we're talking to homeowners, we're doing home safety inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=515.0)|
| 0:08:41| We're doing home safety checks to make sure that any kind of trends we may see that could cause an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=521.0)|
| 0:08:46| that we educate those homeowners on how to prevent the fire department from showing up unwanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=526.0)|
| 0:08:53| So one of the things that I wanted to highlight during the report was the Carnes Fire Department participated in 16 public education events over the last 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=533.0)|
| 0:09:02| And they installed 20 smoke alarms and as many batteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=542.0)|
| 0:09:07| That smoke alarm program is something that obviously citizens in the county can call their community departments and have those installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=547.0)|

| 0:09:47| A lot of those specialty teams, as you may know, those are low frequency, which means they don't happen often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=587.0)|
| 0:09:54| And they're very high risk events, which they can, usually the victim is hurt pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=594.0)|

| 0:10:14| And the rescue squad still continues to be a springboard for folks who are interested in emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=614.0)|
| 0:10:20| It's a great place to volunteer and get your foot in the door, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=620.0)|

| 0:10:48| These folks on this task force have had what we call red card training, or the official level of wild land emergency training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=648.0)|
| 0:10:57| They have equipment to support a wild land emergency team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=657.0)|

| 0:11:19| And so that's really predominantly why those assets are out there, and we're really happy to have those in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=679.0)|
| 0:11:27| Seymour, in the spring of each year, partners with the city fire department so they can use their fire safety trailer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=687.0)|
| 0:11:34| They get into the schools and talk to the kids, second, third, fourth grade classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=694.0)|
| 0:11:40| and do the fire safety house and show them the dangers that could be in the house and how to mitigate those and avoid those dangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=700.0)|
| 0:11:46| And we know for a fact that some of those have paid off because we've had instances where our departments have arrived on scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=706.0)|
| 0:11:53| and some of the kids in the house have said, I talked to Firefighter Smith and he taught us how to get out of this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=713.0)|

| 0:27:39| And the bond is set, you know, you have felonies, misdemeanors, you'll set it as a severity of the crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1659.0)|
| 0:27:45| Not just to punish the person that's accused, but to protect the society and make sure they come to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1665.0)|

| 0:28:08| And last on my list is Mr. Daniel Herrera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1688.0)|
| 0:28:12| Mr. Herrera, if you would please approach the podium, state your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1692.0)|

| 0:28:19| Daniel Herrera, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1699.0)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1700.0)|
| 0:28:21| Would you like to give us some background, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1701.0)|
| 0:28:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1703.0)|
| 0:28:24| First and foremost, good evening, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1704.0)|
| 0:28:26| My name is Daniel Herrera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1706.0)|
| 0:28:27| For those who don't know me, I'm a licensed attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1707.0)|
| 0:28:30| I started my practice back in April 2020, right in the bottom of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1710.0)|
| 0:28:34| Actually, it was when the state actually first shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1714.0)|
| 0:28:37| So I was able to build my practice from really the bottom of the ocean, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1717.0)|
| 0:28:44| So my primary practice is really two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1724.0)|
| 0:28:48| It's family law and it's criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1728.0)|
| 0:28:50| Now, how does that work with the magistrate's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1730.0)|
| 0:28:53| The magistrate's office is the first stop whenever somebody is arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1733.0)|
| 0:28:57| It's the determining whether or not the warrant has enough probable or has established probable cause in order to send that warrant up to the general sessions court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1737.0)|
| 0:29:06| If the magistrate does not find probable cause, the magistrate has a duty to dismiss that warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1746.0)|
| 0:29:13| It is important to have a magistrate who has criminal history background or a background in criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1753.0)|
| 0:29:24| But it's important to have somebody who has actually been in the general sessions courts who has talked to the district attorneys, the assistant district attorneys, to negotiate the plea negotiations and to examine those warrants with the DA to ensure that maybe it's something that the magistrate should have dismissed or maybe it's not quite what the charge was and it should be reduced to a lesser sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1764.0)|
| 0:29:44| So for the past few years, I have pretty much lived in the general sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1784.0)|
| 0:29:49| And I have not only done general sessions courts, but I've also been in the criminal courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1789.0)|
| 0:29:54| In fact, I had a second-degree murder trial just about two or three weeks ago that wrapped up in Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1794.0)|
| 0:29:59| So I've done the whole process of the criminal – essentially criminal litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1799.0)|
| 0:30:04| Now, why is it also important to practice in family law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1804.0)|
| 0:30:08| The importance there is to understand that there's something called an ex parte when you file for an order of protection, and we do that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1808.0)|
| 0:30:18| And it's my understanding that the magistrate's office does review petitions for order of protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1818.0)|
| 0:30:23| And to ensure that that burden is met is not only very important to the office, but it also shows that the respondent or the person receiving that, their rights are also being carefully considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1823.0)|
| 0:30:39| So with that said, I feel like I can do a great service to our general sessions judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1839.0)|
| 0:30:45| I feel like I can do a great service to that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1845.0)|
| 0:30:48| I have – I was not a substitute magistrate, but I did train with them, and it stopped up until the point of getting sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1848.0)|
| 0:30:57| And I've sat down. I saw the arraignment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1857.0)|
| 0:30:59| I saw the process of reviewing the warrant, speaking to the officers, having a good relationship with them, giving them a better understanding of what a good warrant should include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1859.0)|
| 0:31:09| And because of that experience, I think I can do – I think I would do a great job here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1869.0)|
| 0:31:13| And I think I would support our general sessions judges, and I think not only ensuring that the warrants are done correctly and that our officers can rely on the magistrate's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1873.0)|
| 0:31:21| but also understanding that the defendants have rights, and those rights need to be protected under our constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1881.0)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1886.0)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1887.0)|
| 0:31:28| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1888.0)|
| 0:31:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1890.0)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1891.0)|
| 0:31:35| Mr. Herrera, are you a registered voter in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1895.0)|
| 0:31:38| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1898.0)|
| 0:31:39| Okay, and it looks like on your resume here that you've served for 145 shifts as a substitute magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1899.0)|
| 0:31:48| No, sir. No, I did not serve as a substitute magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1908.0)|
| 0:31:53| Am I reading the wrong thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1913.0)|
| 0:31:55| I'm reading the whole – excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1915.0)|
| 0:31:57| You've never served as a – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1917.0)|
| 0:31:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1919.0)|
| 0:32:00| You've not served as a substitute magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1920.0)|
| 0:32:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1922.0)|
| 0:32:03| But you've taken the training to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1923.0)|
| 0:32:05| Yes, and I've done the night shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1925.0)|
| 0:32:07| Okay, gotcha, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1927.0)|
| 0:32:08| Okay, that's where I get – okay, that's where my notes were different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1928.0)|
| 0:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1931.0)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1932.0)|
| 0:32:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1933.0)|
| 0:32:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1934.0)|
| 0:32:15| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1935.0)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1936.0)|
| 0:32:17| Mr. Herrera, first of all, I'll ask you the same question I asked Mr. Jones and Mr. Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1937.0)|
| 0:32:22| Have you ever been convicted of a crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1942.0)|
| 0:32:24| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1944.0)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1945.0)|
| 0:32:26| You said you took the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1946.0)|
| 0:32:28| Can you elaborate on that and why you never did officially substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1948.0)|
| 0:32:32| Yeah, yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1952.0)|
| 0:32:33| So the training – so how it started was I heard that you can become a magistrate office or a substitute magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1953.0)|
| 0:32:39| So I called the magistrate's office to see if they had any availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1959.0)|
| 0:32:42| That's when Chief Magistrate Christopher Rowe informed me that there was a training that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1962.0)|
| 0:32:47| So one night at his 7 o'clock shift – I think it was a Saturday – excuse me, a Thursday – I go down to the magistrate's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1967.0)|
| 0:32:53| He sits me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1973.0)|
| 0:32:54| He shows me the gyms program that they use, shows me how to conduct the arraignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1974.0)|
| 0:32:58| shows me how the process is for the officer to come in and review the warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1978.0)|
| 0:33:03| and essentially make sure that the warrant meets the probable cause standard that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1983.0)|
| 0:33:07| And I didn't stay the whole shift, but I stayed enough to see what the process was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1987.0)|
| 0:33:13| and I felt comfortable enough where I told Chief Rowe that I'd like to continue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=1993.0)|
| 0:33:20| And we got to the point where I got set up on gyms, I got a Knox County account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2000.0)|
| 0:33:26| but the swearing in part just never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2006.0)|
| 0:33:29| I was informed that they just didn't have a need for another substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2009.0)|
| 0:33:34| and at that point I thanked them and I thanked the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2014.0)|
| 0:33:37| and I asked them to just keep me in mind going forward if there's any vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2017.0)|
| 0:33:40| How many hours did you spend with Mr. Rowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2020.0)|
| 0:33:44| It had to be – because it wasn't just with Chief Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2024.0)|
| 0:33:47| I did it in the mornings as well with the other substitutes – excuse me, with the other magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2027.0)|
| 0:33:52| I would say it's probably about, without looking at my record, probably about 35 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2032.0)|
| 0:33:58| And did you interview with the judges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2038.0)|
| 0:34:00| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2040.0)|
| 0:34:01| You did not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2041.0)|
| 0:34:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2042.0)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2043.0)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2045.0)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2046.0)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2049.0)|
| 0:34:10| Mr. Rare, same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2050.0)|
| 0:34:12| You've got your own practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2052.0)|
| 0:34:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2053.0)|
| 0:34:14| Will you be willing to make this a full-time job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2054.0)|
| 0:34:17| Yes, and I can tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2057.0)|
| 0:34:19| This is a full-time job, and even though I have my own practice, you know, I won't take any more cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2059.0)|
| 0:34:24| I do have three employees total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2064.0)|
| 0:34:26| I have two other attorneys that I have employed, and I also have a paralegal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2066.0)|
| 0:34:30| And I've already informed them that if I am blessed with this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2070.0)|
| 0:34:33| that I am no longer going to be taking any more cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2073.0)|
| 0:34:35| and the cases that I have currently are going to be divided amongst my attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2075.0)|
| 0:34:39| and any conflicts with criminal defendants, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2079.0)|
| 0:34:42| we'll make sure we apply and abide by the rules of suppression of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2082.0)|

| 0:34:49| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2089.0)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2090.0)|
| 0:34:51| Mr. Herrera, you're probably aware that the judges sent all of the commissioners a letter of recommendation for two nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2091.0)|
| 0:35:01| These are five of our most esteemed legal professionals that lead our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2101.0)|
| 0:35:07| and they sent forward a letter of recommendation for Mr. Reed and Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2107.0)|
| 0:35:14| When I look at the pedigrees of all of our applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2114.0)|
| 0:35:19| I wonder with Mr. Reed having over 100 shifts actually serving in a substitute magistrate position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2119.0)|
| 0:35:27| and 10 years of legal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2127.0)|
| 0:35:30| Mr. Jones having extensive legal experience and 7 to 10 years in the trenches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2130.0)|
| 0:35:37| how do you think that you're more qualified for this position having essentially three years of experience as a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2137.0)|
| 0:35:45| and no practical experience in the judicial system as a magistrate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2145.0)|
| 0:35:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2149.0)|
| 0:35:50| No, that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2150.0)|
| 0:35:52| To be honest, I've been in the trenches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2152.0)|
| 0:35:54| I've lived in the John F. Sessions courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2154.0)|
| 0:35:55| I've done everything from your probable cause hearings, your preliminary hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2155.0)|
| 0:36:00| to plea by information up in the criminal court as well as going to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2160.0)|
| 0:36:05| Like I said, I just wrapped up a second-degree murder trial just about two or three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2165.0)|
| 0:36:09| So this is not just something – this is not a practice of area that I just dabble in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2169.0)|
| 0:36:14| This is my primary practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2174.0)|
| 0:36:15| And I – the criminal defense work is a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2175.0)|
| 0:36:21| And when you start going into the general sessions courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2181.0)|
| 0:36:24| and you start understanding how the prosecutors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2184.0)|
| 0:36:27| and understanding that not every time an officer gets the warrant right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2187.0)|
| 0:36:33| that it's important to take that feedback that you learn from the district attorney's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2193.0)|
| 0:36:38| and maybe taking that and applying it while being magistrate to ensure that the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2198.0)|
| 0:36:44| whether it's the Knox County Sheriff's Office or Knoxville Police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2204.0)|
| 0:36:47| that those warrants then at that point go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2207.0)|
| 0:36:50| It's about – it's more – you can say it's kind of like an educational experience for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2210.0)|
| 0:36:56| We want to make sure our officers are doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2216.0)|
| 0:36:58| And having examined countless warrants, not just here in Knox County –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2218.0)|
| 0:37:02| I mean talking all over East Tennessee, I feel that I am qualified for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2222.0)|
| 0:37:09| Why did you seek to meet with the five judges who make those nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2229.0)|
| 0:37:14| and seek out one of their nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2234.0)|
| 0:37:16| I wasn't familiar with the process, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2236.0)|
| 0:37:20| I knew the announcement happened because of the Knoxville Bar Association that announced the vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2240.0)|
| 0:37:27| And that's when I – I guess I just assumed that submitting an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2247.0)|
| 0:37:32| or a resume that judges would reach out and maybe speak to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2252.0)|
| 0:37:35| They're not obligated to by any means, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for general assessment judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2255.0)|
| 0:37:39| Please don't take what I'm taking today as a hit on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2259.0)|
| 0:37:42| I think they're fine judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2262.0)|
| 0:37:44| I just wanted to throw my hat in for consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2264.0)|
| 0:37:47| I do think that with my resume, my experience, that I could do a better job than other applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2267.0)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2276.0)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you. Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2278.0)|
| 0:38:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2280.0)|
| 0:38:01| And this is really general questions that I would like to ask if Judge Cerny wouldn't mind answering those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2281.0)|
| 0:38:06| So if we want to wrap up, and I'll let anyone else ask Mr. Herrera if they have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2286.0)|
| 0:38:12| And thank you to all the applicants who applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2292.0)|
| 0:38:15| I mean I applaud you for wanting to serve in this capacity, and I'm very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2295.0)|
| 0:38:21| Are there any further questions for Mr. Herrera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2301.0)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2308.0)|
| 0:38:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2309.0)|
| 0:38:31| Judge Cerny, would you mind approaching the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2311.0)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2321.0)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2322.0)|
| 0:38:43| My name is Chuck Cerny, and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2323.0)|
| 0:38:47| Hello, Judge Cerny. It's good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2327.0)|
| 0:38:49| It's very nice to see you, and it's good to be together again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2329.0)|
| 0:38:56| Yes, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2336.0)|
| 0:38:57| And not covered with mud and playing volleyball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2337.0)|
| 0:39:01| Yeah, this is a little nicer, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2341.0)|
| 0:39:04| I just had some general questions about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2344.0)|
| 0:39:07| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2347.0)|
| 0:39:08| Being new to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2348.0)|
| 0:39:09| So I'm going to just kind of put my questions out there, and then you will address them as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2349.0)|
| 0:39:14| One is just curious, what is the application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2354.0)|
| 0:39:17| and what is the criteria for recommendations from the judges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2357.0)|
| 0:39:22| Second, how many applications were received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2362.0)|
| 0:39:25| Third, were all interviewed by the judges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2365.0)|
| 0:39:28| And my last question, how many candidates have been recommended to commission in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2368.0)|
| 0:39:35| We'll start with the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2375.0)|
| 0:39:36| What is the application process and the criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2376.0)|
| 0:39:38| The application process is applicants, there was a notice put in the Bar Association publication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2378.0)|
| 0:39:46| and applicants turned in their resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2386.0)|
| 0:39:50| They would, in the normal course, apply with County Commission to be appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2390.0)|
| 0:39:57| and then they'd have to be approved by the five sessions judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2397.0)|
| 0:40:01| Historically, some years ago, County Commission chose to approach the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2401.0)|
| 0:40:07| and say we have this pool of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2407.0)|
| 0:40:10| Instead of us appointing folks that you would not approve, give us a list of who you would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2410.0)|
| 0:40:17| And so we have historically done that, which is what our letter is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2417.0)|
| 0:40:22| Those are the applicants we would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2422.0)|
| 0:40:25| And so it does kind of flip the process on its head, but that is the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2425.0)|
| 0:40:32| and that's our adaptation and our practical application of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2432.0)|
| 0:40:38| So those are the applicants we would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2438.0)|
| 0:40:43| How many applications did you receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2443.0)|
| 0:40:46| About nine or ten-ish, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2446.0)|
| 0:40:48| And were all of those applicants invited for an interview, or is that part of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2448.0)|
| 0:40:52| We did not necessarily invite applicants for interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2452.0)|
| 0:40:56| There was some contact by some of them, and, of course, many of them are actually my friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2456.0)|
| 0:41:03| so I try to be accessible to my friends, and so I did speak with several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2463.0)|
| 0:41:10| And in the past, typically how many applicants have been recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2470.0)|
| 0:41:16| Does it just depend on the number of applications received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2476.0)|
| 0:41:20| It would depend on the number of applications received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2480.0)|
| 0:41:23| and I'm certain that we have sent to county commission on one or two occasions, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2483.0)|
| 0:41:29| one applicant that we would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2489.0)|
| 0:41:31| I'm certain that we've sent five, six, you know, just depending on who the applicants are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2491.0)|
| 0:41:38| And what we relied upon is the resumes of the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2498.0)|
| 0:41:43| the experience level that they had with respect to training and substituting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2503.0)|
| 0:41:49| and then their performance in court or personal contacts with them in the context of having cases in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2509.0)|
| 0:41:58| So it's not customary for commission to receive copies of all resumes of the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2518.0)|
| 0:42:05| only those that are recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2525.0)|
| 0:42:07| I've got them on my desk with other stuff that I should probably put in a file somewhere, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2527.0)|
| 0:42:12| I can dig it out from all the other stuff that I feel guilty about not reading but not shredding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2532.0)|
| 0:42:18| I'm working on my organization, trying to get better at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2538.0)|
| 0:42:24| Thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2544.0)|
| 0:42:25| I do have the applications if you're really curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2545.0)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2547.0)|
| 0:42:28| That concludes my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2548.0)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2549.0)|
| 0:42:31| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2551.0)|
| 0:42:32| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2552.0)|
| 0:42:34| Thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2554.0)|
| 0:42:35| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2555.0)|
| 0:42:36| It's very nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2556.0)|
| 0:42:39| I brought the question up to all the candidates about will this be their full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2559.0)|
| 0:42:45| Not too long ago, we've had some substitutes that we taxpayers, I think, were getting doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2565.0)|
| 0:42:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2573.0)|
| 0:42:54| Say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2574.0)|
| 0:42:55| The taxpayers, not too long ago, we had an issue with magistrate not being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2575.0)|
| 0:43:02| and we're having to pay a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2582.0)|
| 0:43:05| Taxpayers are paying twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2585.0)|
| 0:43:07| This is a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2587.0)|
| 0:43:09| They need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2589.0)|
| 0:43:11| They need to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2591.0)|
| 0:43:12| How many substitutes do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2592.0)|
| 0:43:14| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2594.0)|
| 0:43:16| I think, at this point, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2596.0)|
| 0:43:20| Three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2600.0)|
| 0:43:21| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2601.0)|
| 0:43:22| And why would a substitute need to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2602.0)|
| 0:43:25| We do have a prescribed amount of vacation and personal leave time that a magistrate is entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2605.0)|
| 0:43:35| Magistrates do, on occasion, become ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2615.0)|
| 0:43:38| We did, in fact, have a magistrate who apparently successfully, even though he's had a difficult battle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2618.0)|
| 0:43:47| has prevailed over cancer, and so he did have some substitute time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2627.0)|
| 0:43:53| Now, those things having been said, I've been presiding judge for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2633.0)|
| 0:44:00| I had the privilege of being presiding judge for a double shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2640.0)|
| 0:44:04| because last year Judge Stansberry very graciously allowed me to bypass that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2644.0)|
| 0:44:12| I was kind of busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2652.0)|
| 0:44:13| So I've been presiding judge for a little shot of a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2653.0)|
| 0:44:17| One of the things that has come to my attention is we need to do a little better with respect to our organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2657.0)|
| 0:44:26| of scheduling with our magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2666.0)|
| 0:44:29| And, in fact, a meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2669.0)|
| 0:44:32| I anticipate we'll be working hard to be ready for any scrutiny that we may have with respect to seeing to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2672.0)|
| 0:44:41| that the magistrates do what the general sessions judges do, which is when we're called upon and when needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2681.0)|
| 0:44:48| we substitute for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2688.0)|
| 0:44:51| We're often called upon, and the other four sessions judges do a really beautiful job of taking on hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2691.0)|
| 0:44:58| when we have a busy docket and there are multiple hearings getting stacked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2698.0)|
| 0:45:03| We cover each other's shifts when we have illness or doctor's appointments, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2703.0)|
| 0:45:09| So we're going to be working at helping the magistrates with their scheduling and organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2709.0)|
| 0:45:16| and I anticipate that that will be happening quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2716.0)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2720.0)|
| 0:45:21| I appreciate you doing that because it's taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2721.0)|
| 0:45:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2725.0)|
| 0:45:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2727.0)|
| 0:45:29| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2729.0)|
| 0:45:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2731.0)|
| 0:45:33| Your Honor, when you had stated that you had nine or ten applications in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2733.0)|
| 0:45:43| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2743.0)|
| 0:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2744.0)|
| 0:45:45| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2745.0)|
| 0:45:46| I'm not sure if Commissioner Fraser asked this or not, but how many actually were interviewed out of those nine or ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2746.0)|
| 0:45:54| There was no formal interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2754.0)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2756.0)|
| 0:45:57| So it was just the resume, you recognized the name or not, but nobody was interviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2757.0)|
| 0:46:02| Candidly, Mr. Reid and I pass by each other in the hall with some frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2762.0)|
| 0:46:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2767.0)|
| 0:46:08| And Mr. Jones and I have had cases together where he's done a laudable job of representing his clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2768.0)|
| 0:46:16| Mr. Herrera has also been in court as well, and so I've had the opportunity to befriend him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2776.0)|
| 0:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2783.0)|
| 0:46:24| And then who are the three substitute magistrates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2784.0)|
| 0:46:30| Spencer Reid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2790.0)|
| 0:46:32| Ben Stallard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2792.0)|
| 0:46:35| Okay, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2795.0)|
| 0:46:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2796.0)|
| 0:46:39| Does she want to come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2799.0)|
| 0:46:41| Douglas Finnan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2801.0)|
| 0:46:42| And who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2802.0)|
| 0:46:43| It's the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2803.0)|
| 0:46:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2805.0)|
| 0:46:46| He was a substitute, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2806.0)|
| 0:46:47| Yes, sir, but he was not one of the substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2807.0)|
| 0:46:49| He did not apply for a permanent position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2809.0)|
| 0:46:56| We're using fewer substitutes because it's taxpayer dollars, right, Commissioner Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2816.0)|
| 0:47:02| So who was the third one then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2822.0)|
| 0:47:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2823.0)|
| 0:47:04| Doug Finnan has been a substitute magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2824.0)|
| 0:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2827.0)|
| 0:47:08| And then of any of the three that are currently substitute magistrates, did any of those apply for the position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2828.0)|
| 0:47:16| Spencer Reid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2836.0)|
| 0:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2838.0)|
| 0:47:19| So he's the one that is the most trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2839.0)|
| 0:47:21| He's been trained some time ago, and he's actually served shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2841.0)|
| 0:47:25| He's done this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2845.0)|
| 0:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2846.0)|
| 0:47:27| Now, is he on your list of recommendations to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2847.0)|
| 0:47:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2850.0)|
| 0:47:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2851.0)|
| 0:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2852.0)|
| 0:47:33| We've already interviewed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2853.0)|
| 0:47:36| Your Honor, Sterling Walsh is the other substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2856.0)|
| 0:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2860.0)|
| 0:47:41| Who was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2861.0)|
| 0:47:42| He was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2862.0)|
| 0:47:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2863.0)|
| 0:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2864.0)|
| 0:47:45| A gentleman by the name of Sterling Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2865.0)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2867.0)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2868.0)|
| 0:47:49| One name I missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2869.0)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2870.0)|
| 0:47:52| Commissioner, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2872.0)|
| 0:47:55| I'm privileged to be near a microphone and have so many esteemed colleagues and elected officials listening to me talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2875.0)|
| 0:48:03| Can we keep doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2883.0)|
| 0:48:04| This is fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2884.0)|
| 0:48:06| Well, there are several more lights on, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2886.0)|
| 0:48:10| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2890.0)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2892.0)|
| 0:48:13| Your Honor, you all have submitted a nomination letter with two names on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2893.0)|
| 0:48:20| What would happen if someone was selected that was not on the choices of the five judges that submitted that letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2900.0)|
| 0:48:29| We would respectfully decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2909.0)|
| 0:48:31| We would start this process all over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2911.0)|
| 0:48:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2913.0)|
| 0:48:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2914.0)|
| 0:48:37| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2917.0)|
| 0:48:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2920.0)|
| 0:48:41| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2921.0)|
| 0:48:42| I appreciate that and for responding to me also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2922.0)|
| 0:48:47| That's very much appreciated, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2927.0)|
| 0:48:52| The question about magistrates having another practice or working on the side, is there any type of a rule prohibiting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2932.0)|
| 0:49:09| We would certainly not want to see that magistrate defend criminal cases in Knox County based on the fact that there could be a very serious conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2949.0)|
| 0:49:21| There have been occasions historically where magistrates have undertaken to have an abbreviated or reduced civil practice only so long as they're not adversely impacting their responsibilities as a magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2961.0)|
| 0:49:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2979.0)|
| 0:49:41| So there's not an understanding that if someone is selected and they're working a side job, so to speak, that that is not allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2981.0)|
| 0:49:56| There is no specific rule or law that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=2996.0)|
| 0:50:00| It's highly recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3000.0)|
| 0:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3002.0)|
| 0:50:03| And it is part of our considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3003.0)|
| 0:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3005.0)|
| 0:50:07| I did receive the letter that you sent to all of us, and you did have two names on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3007.0)|
| 0:50:14| Did we catch all the typos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3014.0)|
| 0:50:17| Oh, and I couldn't tell you that because I'd probably miss them the same as you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3017.0)|
| 0:50:22| And I understand that in the end that you judges have veto power over anyone that we were to select anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3022.0)|
| 0:50:34| That's a term I wouldn't have chosen to use, but if that's how to better understand the process, then so be it, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3034.0)|
| 0:50:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3047.0)|
| 0:50:50| In effect, and I really had a difficult time even understanding why we, the commission, were in this process, and I did ask Mr. Moyers to review that law for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3050.0)|
| 0:51:07| So with your permission, Madam Chair, I'd like him to just kind of give us a quick overview exactly of what the law says in regard to a magistrate appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3067.0)|
| 0:51:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3079.0)|
| 0:51:21| This is governed by Tennessee Code Annotated 40-1-111, which is kind of a funky statute because it's one of those where the legislature has gone in and kind of tinkered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3081.0)|
| 0:51:32| and has provisions that are aimed at particular counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3092.0)|
| 0:51:36| So, for example, paragraph A-1-A states that the chief body of any county having a population of not less than 200,000 or a population of not less than 276,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3096.0)|
| 0:51:48| nor more than 277,000, according to the 1970 census or any subsequent census, may appoint, and the chief legislative body of any county having a population of over 800,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3108.0)|
| 0:51:59| according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent federal census, may initially appoint one or more judicial magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3119.0)|
| 0:52:07| Now, as it happens, in the 1970 federal census, Knox County had a population between 276,000 and 277,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3127.0)|
| 0:52:15| So this was clearly aimed at Knox County and no other county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3135.0)|
| 0:52:19| Now, so that's where you get the authority to appoint the magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3139.0)|
| 0:52:23| But when you go down to 41-111, subparagraph small c, what it says is that notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3143.0)|
| 0:52:34| in any county having a population of not less than 276,000 nor more than 277,000, according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent federal census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3154.0)|
| 0:52:45| any appointment of a judicial commissioner pursuant to subsection a, which I just read to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3165.0)|
| 0:52:50| shall be subject to the approval by a majority of the general sessions judges in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3170.0)|
| 0:52:55| So this is a provision that appears to be unique to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3175.0)|
| 0:53:00| I couldn't tell you the genesis of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3180.0)|
| 0:53:03| Judge Cerny might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3183.0)|
| 0:53:05| But in any event, that's what we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3185.0)|
| 0:53:07| So the appointment authority is yours, but with the consent of the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3187.0)|
| 0:53:13| So as Judge Cerny said, over the years this process has evolved so that we don't get in a situation where a person is appointed that the judges find to be unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3193.0)|
| 0:53:22| and we have to come back the next month and do it all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3202.0)|
| 0:53:25| So that's why we do it the way we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3205.0)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3208.0)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3209.0)|
| 0:53:31| And I know you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3211.0)|
| 0:53:33| That was for the rest of us, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3213.0)|
| 0:53:35| I've got a great lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3215.0)|
| 0:53:37| I call on Mr. Moyers every time I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3217.0)|
| 0:53:41| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3221.0)|
| 0:53:42| So in a nutshell, what I'm understanding about this process is you all have sent us two candidates that you feel like are the best applicants for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3222.0)|
| 0:53:53| And, in effect, those are our two that we need to choose from because if we do not, if we choose another applicant, that it will be overridden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3233.0)|
| 0:54:05| I mean, that's it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3245.0)|
| 0:54:07| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3247.0)|
| 0:54:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3248.0)|
| 0:54:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3249.0)|
| 0:54:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3250.0)|
| 0:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3251.0)|
| 0:54:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3252.0)|
| 0:54:13| I just wanted to be sure I understand it top to bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3253.0)|
| 0:54:16| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3256.0)|
| 0:54:18| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3258.0)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3259.0)|
| 0:54:20| Judge Cerny, Benjamin Stallard is a current substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3260.0)|
| 0:54:25| Is there a reason he wasn't selected in the finalists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3265.0)|
| 0:54:30| The judges have unanimously sent to you the two applicants we would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3270.0)|
| 0:54:40| And did you interview Mr. Jones before you selected him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3280.0)|
| 0:54:46| As I said before, there was no formal interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3286.0)|
| 0:54:51| I myself have had several cases with Mr. Jones, and the other judges all have had cases with the two applicants that are in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3291.0)|
| 0:55:06| So have you discussed Mr. Jones' convictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3306.0)|
| 0:55:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3310.0)|
| 0:55:11| I was aware of Mr. Jones' convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3311.0)|
| 0:55:14| Not at the time the letter was signed and sent, but I have become aware, and he's been candid with me about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3314.0)|
| 0:55:22| And he's also a licensed attorney who has passed the ethics requirements to be a member of the Tennessee Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3322.0)|
| 0:55:31| So we've relied on the Board of Law Examiners to thoroughly vet him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3331.0)|
| 0:55:37| and I would anticipate that the impression that we have had of him when he's practiced in court being favorable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3337.0)|
| 0:55:47| that's something that is likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3347.0)|
| 0:55:55| I would say the Bar concurs in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3355.0)|
| 0:56:00| And Judge Cerny, to your knowledge, has Mr. Jones substituted as a magistrate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3360.0)|
| 0:56:07| I believe that he's received training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3367.0)|
| 0:56:09| He's as good a source of information that, in his comments here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3369.0)|
| 0:56:16| indicate that he's received formal training from our chief magistrate, if I understand correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3376.0)|
| 0:56:24| I don't think he's actually served a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3384.0)|
| 0:56:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3387.0)|
| 0:56:28| One of the most important things about this position, this position is I was on high school sports teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3388.0)|
| 0:56:41| I wasn't good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3401.0)|
| 0:56:43| As a matter of fact, I didn't pass the fitness test for the chess team at my high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3403.0)|
| 0:56:48| One of the things that we found on our American team sports is that there are certain kids who really do an excellent job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3408.0)|
| 0:57:00| of fulfilling their responsibilities that the coach gives them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3420.0)|
| 0:57:04| spend a little extra time in the weight room to get ready, all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3424.0)|
| 0:57:08| but they don't make a lot of noise and they don't require a lot of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3428.0)|
| 0:57:14| We've had a recent situation that required a lot of maintenance and attention, and it's harmed our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3434.0)|
| 0:57:23| But what's expected of our magistrates is that they quietly do their job excellently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3443.0)|
| 0:57:29| without attracting a lot of attention to themselves because any attention would be negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3449.0)|
| 0:57:35| So as a result, I think that with the current pool of applicants, we have recommended two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3455.0)|
| 0:57:44| and we would appreciate your picking one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3464.0)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3470.0)|
| 0:57:51| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3471.0)|
| 0:57:54| I just want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3474.0)|
| 0:57:56| Thank you, Judge Cerny, for coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3476.0)|
| 0:57:59| I feel like there's more focus on Attorney Troy Jones' conviction than whatever Spencer said that he'd done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3479.0)|
| 0:58:07| So I would like to call Troy Jones back up, and I want to know how old he was and how long that conviction was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3487.0)|
| 0:58:15| Does that mean I have to sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3495.0)|
| 0:58:17| I guess if they're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3497.0)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3499.0)|
| 0:58:20| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3500.0)|
| 0:58:21| Judge Cerny, there's one more question for you, and then we'll Mr. Jones, if you would please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3501.0)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner Spoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3508.0)|
| 0:58:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3509.0)|
| 0:58:30| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3510.0)|
| 0:58:34| I just want to make sure I got this clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3514.0)|
| 0:58:36| So the Benjamin Stallard who did send us a resume, he is not in the audience here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3516.0)|
| 0:58:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3523.0)|
| 0:58:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3524.0)|
| 0:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3525.0)|
| 0:58:46| So in looking at his resume, it says he's been a substitute magistrate for approximately three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3526.0)|
| 0:58:56| and he's one of the three that you guys call on, and he did fill out an application to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3536.0)|
| 0:59:05| and apparently with over 145 shifts, that's pretty substantial, I would guess, as a substitute magistrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3545.0)|
| 0:59:13| but yet the judges want him to be a substitute but not a judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3553.0)|
| 0:59:22| Is that what I'm getting out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3562.0)|
| 0:59:25| At this time, we have sent a letter with two of the applicants who we would approve, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3565.0)|
| 0:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3576.0)|
| 0:59:37| And then again, none of the applicants were interviewed at all for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3577.0)|
| 0:59:41| There was no formal interview process, and as I've said, we relied on the resumes, the experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3581.0)|
| 0:59:48| and our personal contacts with the lawyers because, as you might imagine, we've seen them perform in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=3588.0)|

| 1:07:20| interim period so that there won't be a problem with them going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4040.0)|
| 1:07:24| So this is corrective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4044.0)|
| 1:07:26| It's unfortunate that it was missed, but I think with the passage of this resolution, we can fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4046.0)|
| 1:07:36| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4056.0)|
| 1:07:39| I spoke with Amy this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4059.0)|
| 1:07:40| My only concern was this, and it's not really a concern, is that, and they've been doing this for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4060.0)|
| 1:07:46| and Amy confirmed it, Director Brooks confirmed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4066.0)|
| 1:07:50| I don't want to see a plant that has to have a BZA appeal to build a house on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4070.0)|
| 1:07:56| And if they see that, that goes directly to planning, doesn't it, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4076.0)|
| 1:08:01| You can come down and help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4081.0)|
| 1:08:03| I don't want, you know, a developer cannot develop a subdivision that's got a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4083.0)|
| 1:08:10| to create their own appeal to the zoning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4090.0)|
| 1:08:16| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4096.0)|
| 1:08:17| Any time that staff comes across the need for a variance, those get either pushed to BZA or they go to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4097.0)|
| 1:08:27| That's what you've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4107.0)|
| 1:08:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4108.0)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4109.0)|
| 1:08:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4110.0)|
| 1:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4112.0)|
| 1:08:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4113.0)|
| 1:08:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4114.0)|
| 1:08:35| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4115.0)|
| 1:08:37| Did you want to kind of give us a little more history and what's going on and how this affects your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4117.0)|
| 1:08:42| Is there any other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4122.0)|
| 1:08:47| There's no other, I mean, I think that Director Moyers laid it out accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4127.0)|
| 1:08:53| I would say, you know, if the, I can give you like what happens if you approve it versus if you don't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4133.0)|
| 1:09:00| Would that be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4140.0)|
| 1:09:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4141.0)|
| 1:09:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4142.0)|
| 1:09:03| So if a commission wishes to approve the resolution, planning commission will then be given authority to grant staff the authorities to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4143.0)|
| 1:09:10| and approve plots with no more than 25 lots administratively as long as they do not require a variance to the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4150.0)|
| 1:09:17| or any other regulations of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4157.0)|
| 1:09:20| And this is basically reaffirming how we've been doing business since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4160.0)|
| 1:09:24| If you all were to deny this resolution, then the planning commission would have to review all plots that come before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4164.0)|
| 1:09:36| that are submitted to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4176.0)|
| 1:09:38| So regardless of the size of those plots, they'd have to go to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4178.0)|
| 1:09:43| This may add anywhere from 45 days or more to the plot review process for the vast majority of those that are submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4183.0)|
| 1:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4191.0)|
| 1:09:53| So when you say 25 or less with no variances, so that means there would not be any side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4193.0)|
| 1:09:59| or rear setback reductions that the staff now has the authority to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4199.0)|
| 1:10:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4205.0)|
| 1:10:06| And those, if someone's requesting a deviation for what the subdivision regulations require or a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4206.0)|
| 1:10:15| those have to go to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4215.0)|
| 1:10:17| Staff cannot approve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4217.0)|
| 1:10:19| So if there's concerns about that, that might be something that can be addressed during the unified development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4219.0)|
| 1:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4225.0)|
| 1:10:27| So you're comfortable with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4227.0)|
| 1:10:29| I am, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4229.0)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4231.0)|
| 1:10:34| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4234.0)|
| 1:10:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4236.0)|
| 1:10:37| Director Brooks, in talking with you this morning, I think you said we identified maybe 25, 26 that might have to retroactively to May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4237.0)|
| 1:10:46| that would come before planning commission again, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4246.0)|
| 1:10:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4250.0)|
| 1:10:51| As we discussed and as Director Moyers alluded to, there were 26 plots of 26 or more that have been approved since this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4251.0)|
| 1:11:02| And one thing that I did ask of Director Brooks is that those would be publicly noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4262.0)|
| 1:11:07| so constituents would be able to attend those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4267.0)|
| 1:11:13| And she did explain, and I think it's important to explain to the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4273.0)|
| 1:11:17| that when these come back before planning commission, this is a yes or a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4277.0)|
| 1:11:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4283.0)|
| 1:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4285.0)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4287.0)|
| 1:11:28| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4288.0)|
| 1:11:32| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4292.0)|

| 1:12:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230717-b?start=4344.0)|
