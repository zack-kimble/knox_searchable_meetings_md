| 0:02:24| All in favor, say aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| The minutes have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| At this time, the Knox County Law Director will swear in the individuals who are going to testify before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=150)|

| 0:02:58| If you are here today to appear and testify before this, the Knox County Beer Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| do you solemnly swear and affirm the testimony you shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you. You may be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Do you want to read section 2-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, there's a section in the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| I think I misplaced it. Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| About intentionally misleading the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Section 2.3 of the Knox County Charter, and it says verbatim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| any person lying to or intentionally misleading the Knox County Commission, committees, subcommittees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| or any Knox County Board or Commission authorized by county ordinance or by state statute while testifying as a witness under oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=221)|
| 0:03:51| shall be guilty of the offense of civil perjury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Such offense shall be punishable by a fine of $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| Thank you, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Madam Clerk, 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Country Burrito Fresh Mix, 10636 Hardin Valley Road, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=253)|
| 0:04:22| Let's see. Sheriff, Representative Cole, would you like to go ahead and address us on this, even though the owners aren't here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=262)|
| 0:04:32| On 6-7-2021, approximately 19-27 hours, Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted a compliance check at the Country Burrito,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=272)|
| 0:04:42| sent an underage person in, the individual purchased two 16-ounce frozen margaritas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=282)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you. Mr. Law Director, do you want to give us your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| This one, 5A and 5B, it was the same thing where they got a slushier frozen margarita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| which any liquor other than beer is covered under the Alcoholic Beverage Administration of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| Commission Administration, ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| We, under our ordinance, have only the power to control the sale of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| and this, with all due respect, the sheriff's person that went in there did exactly the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| and there was, without question, a sale because these owners have admitted it, a sale to an underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=330)|
| 0:05:39| That having been done, we have a problem that's just arisen kind of statewide because now they're selling slushies at these ABC stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=339)|
| 0:05:49| and it's like you go in and you want a beer and you're going to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| We've got jurisdiction of that. We don't have jurisdiction of anything to do with liquor sales, which would be a margarita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| And we discussed this a little bit at the last meeting, and I've researched the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| and I think the sheriff has talked to the special agent in charge of the ABC, and he may want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| But in my opinion, all we have the authority to do is address the sale of beer, beer only, to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=375)|
| 0:06:23| ABC has authority to jerk their liquor license altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| We can't jerk their beer license because the way I read the law right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| until the legislature wants to change it, sale of a slushie or whatever they call those things now, seems to be in the gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=394)|
| 0:06:43| Clearly ABC can do it. They can jerk their liquor license, and if they jerk their liquor license, their beer license goes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| Having said that, the sheriff did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| He cited the owner or the whoever there that did it in these two cases to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| and the sheriff can address that better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| It's a misdemeanor. They're going to court. They will be punished by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| We just have no authority, in my opinion, since it was a liquor drink, any authority to jerk their beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| because clearly all we have is authority under statute to deal with beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| and I defer to the sheriff to give his comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| The individual that sold the alcoholic beverage to the minor was cited to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| It was a misdemeanor arrest, so therefore he had to turn himself into the court and be fingerprinted and booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| That is a Class A misdemeanor, and it will or it can serve up to 11 months and 29 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=462)|
| 0:07:51| On advice from the Knox County clerk, since we have no jurisdiction over this particular matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| I'll look to the 6th District Commissioner, Ms. Hill, to move that we withdraw this from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=477)|
| 0:08:07| Move to withdraw from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Any discussion? Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| I had a question as it pertains to where we can go moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=498)|
| 0:08:28| This person that sold the beverage has been arrested and cited to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Do we ever use that on normal beer sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| I mean, we're constantly looking for ways to defer and keep beer sales from happening to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=517)|
| 0:08:46| Are they typically arrested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| For each violation that has come before the Board in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| each person that has sold the alcoholic beverage to the minor has been cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| And is there any way that the evidence and the authority of our Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| in this sale of liquor can be turned over to ABC and them be able to use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| I think it already has been turned over to ABC, but it's up to their discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| and I would hope that they would take the evidence that our Sheriff has gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and take the appropriate action against these two that sold liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Mr. Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Let me ask the Law Director this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| You have to have a beer license to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| You have to have a liquor license to sell liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Did they have a liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| They do have a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| All in favor of withdrawal, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=597)|

| 0:10:14| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| On 6721 at approximately 8 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=617)|

| 0:16:22| Which would entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| We just need to know if you completed server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=988)|

| 0:16:35| So server training means ABC card, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=998)|

| 0:23:42| And if you would also, everyone, keep the Laycock family in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| We had a Knox County Sheriff's officers pass away suddenly just here in the last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| 34 years on the force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| And I know our sheriff is missing tonight to attend to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| So Commissioner Busser, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| I want to introduce you to a person I literally and figuratively have watched grow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| He grew up with my two daughters, and I saw him flower into a great man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| And I hate to say that because it makes me look real old as the stature of this man comes out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| But I'm really proud to introduce Todd Stennett, who is a constituent and a very Christian man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1461)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| I appreciate knowing you and the way you serve us in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| And I count it a wonderful honor to be here to stand before you tonight to address you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| Tonight, I want to share with you God's advice for those that are governing authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| I want to read to you Psalm 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Here are the words of Scripture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Why do the nations rage, and the people plot a vain thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| against the Lord and against His anointed, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Let us break their bonds in pieces and cast away their cords from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| He who sits in the heavens shall laugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| The Lord shall hold them in derision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Then He shall speak to them in His wrath and distress them in His deep displeasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| I will declare the decree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| The Lord has said to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| You are my son, and today I have begotten you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| and the ends of the earth for your possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| You shall break them with a rod of iron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| and you shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Now therefore, be wise, O kings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Be instructed, you judges of the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish in the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| when His wrath is kindled but a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| Blessed are those that put their trust in Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| I've got just a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| And in that time, what I want to do is encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| to do the very best that you can to serve God by serving others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| The first thing I want to encourage you to do this evening is to serve the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Based on verse 11, the Scripture says there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Serve the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| All that to say that all of you are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| not to serve yourselves but to serve others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| It's an amazing opportunity and privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Remember, Jesus said this about Himself in Mark chapter 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| The Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| and to give His life as a ransom for many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| God did not put you here to do something for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| He put you here, and I know that you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| to serve the residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| So serve them with integrity and excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| I encourage you also tonight, based on verse 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| not only to serve the Lord but to fear the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| The Bible says that your service as a governing authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| should be with fear and be with trembling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Now that may seem like a discomforting thought to some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Why should it be that you and I should serve God with fear and trembling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| Well, it's because we realize that we are subject to Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Our God, the God of heaven and earth, the God above all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| is the sovereign above all sovereigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| He is the King of kings, and He is the Lord of lords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| One of these days the Bible tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| we'll all have to give an account of our lives to Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| You know, the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 9, verse 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| it's appointed to man once to die, and after that, the judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| The only reason that all of you are commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| is because the Bible says in Romans 13 that God Himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| has appointed you to your place of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| So I encourage you this evening to legislate and to govern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| in a manner that is pleasing to our Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| Number three, let me encourage you tonight to praise the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Based on verse 11, Psalm 2 says there that you and I are to rejoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Now, the Hebrew word for rejoice carries the idea of gladness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| So I ask you tonight, what do you and I have to be glad about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Well, you and I ought to rejoice and be glad that God gave us life this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| We ought to rejoice and be glad that God gave us the breath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| that we just drew into our lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| You, as commissioners, ought to rejoice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| that God has placed you in a position where you can help so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| Most of all, we rejoice because God has provided for every single one of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| regardless of our color, our place, our finances, or any difference we might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| The Lord has provided for us an atoning sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| through the blood of His Son, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| How blessed we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Let me encourage you, number four, to love the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| As you serve Him, as you fear Him, as you praise Him, love Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| If I ask you tonight, commissioners, what is the highest calling of your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| what would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Would you say tonight that it's to be a husband or a wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| a parent, a child, a commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| As important as all those things might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| none of those things is truly your highest calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Jesus was very clear about the highest calling of each one of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| He said that you and I are to love the Lord our God with all of our heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| with all our soul, with all of our mind, and with all of our strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| I ask you tonight, would your service to this community change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| if you saw your commissioner duties as an opportunity to love the Lord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| more than anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Number five, and finally tonight, thank you for allowing me to share this time with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| but let me say to you here to end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| I encourage you tonight to trust the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Verse 12 said, Blessed are those who put their trust in Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| Did you know that in God we trust was made the official motto of the United States in 1956?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| Some say, see, we haven't always trusted in God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| but did you know that it first appeared on our currency in 1864?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| Today every bill and coin minted by the U.S. Treasury says those indelible, irrevocable words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| in God we trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| But I ask you tonight, commissioners, do we really trust in Him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| or are we trusting in our economy, our great military?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| I've got a son serving the military in the Navy in South Carolina right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| but my ultimate trust is not in our military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| It's not in our vast natural resources here in this awesome country that God has blessed us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| Our trust should always be highest and foremost in Almighty God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=1879)|

| 0:52:40| Whereas the Farragut High School girls softball team recently prevailed over Coffey County with a 4-2 victory to win the Class AAA state championship title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3160)|

| 0:54:52| whereas, we're not finished yet, whereas the Farragut High School softball team's hard work, talent, teamwork, and perseverance were all contributing factors to their highly successful season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3292)|
| 0:55:08| and whereas the Knox County Commission desires to recognize and congratulate the Farragut High School girls softball team and all associated with the program for capturing the Class AAA state championship title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3308)|
| 0:55:23| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows, the Commission of Knox County hereby honors the Farragut High School girls softball team for an outstanding 2021 season, which culminated in winning the coveted Class AAA state championship title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3323)|

| 0:56:14| First, let me thank all of you for allowing us to play this season. One of our members, Avery Flatford, came and spoke on behalf of all the athletes in Knox County earlier in the year, in which case we were allowed to participate and all of us gathered here were able to win titles this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3374)|
| 0:56:43| Thank you for honoring them for all their hard work and effort. They deserve it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3403)|
| 0:56:53| Would you like to recognize the three seniors? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Our three seniors, I think only two are here at the moment. Jordan Conight. Where's Jordan? Here's Jordan. And Kaylee Taylor. She's over here. And our other one, Cameron Young, who's on vacation. Again, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3416)|
| 0:57:26| You do such a good job. We would never take that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3446)|
| 0:57:57| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3477)|

| 0:58:36| Mr. Bagwell, if you would please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| Jeff Bagwell, 160 North Campbell Station Road in Farragut. Thank you, Commissioner Jay, Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3520)|
| 0:58:50| This is our June report for 2021. It goes something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| We had 931 medical first responder calls, 57 car crashes, 30 structure fires, 97 false alarms, 19 hazardous condition incidents, 270 invalid assist or smoke investigations, and 206 car fires, brush fires or rubbish fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3535)|
| 0:59:17| And all 1,610 total incidents for the month of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| We responded to properties valued at $662,500, and we had a property loss of a little over $140,000, which means that we saved an average of 79% of the valued property we responded to with an average response time of 5 minutes and 18 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3562)|
| 0:59:40| 86% of our reported fires were contained to the room of origin, which is pretty remarkable, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| Station 30 in Halls continues to be the busiest, and I don't foresee that changing, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| Responding to 201 emergencies in Station 41 in Farragut was behind them at 161.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3591)|
| 1:00:00| The North Battalion, Commissioner Bussler, remains the busiest at 625 emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| We have no idea why that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| And the busiest time in Knox County is between 2 and 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| Unfortunately, this month, since we met last, we did have one fire fatality in a fire that occurred on the 29th of June at the Autumn Landing Apartments on Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3613)|
| 1:00:24| Our initial crews were able to rescue the victim from the burning apartment, but were not able to revive her, and she succumbed to her injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| We certainly don't like reporting losses of life, and that is something that our team will take up with the Fire Prevention Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| and try to do a better job at training our citizens in the hazards associated with fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| Through our partnership with Knox County, we added two new educational videos to our YouTube library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| We had 28,600 views for the month, representing 2,600 hours of program time, logging 404,000 impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3650)|
| 1:01:00| We also added 86 new subscribers to our YouTube channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| In addition, we had 26 in-person events. That number is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| As we go into the summer, you'll hear about that next month, which represented 1,700 contacts in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| So total contacts via all conduits was approximately 30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| Our membership percentages for the month of June have increased from last month to just around 47%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| I want to introduce you to three of our newest employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Now, we've hired a lot of people in the last month and several of the last months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| These three, along with two others, are pretty special, so let me explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| These five came from within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| We have an explore post that has young people in it from 14 to 18 years of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| and in years past, we've not hired those people quick enough, and they've gone to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| This year, we hired all five of them, three of which are with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| So hopefully, we've been able to, and we continue, we have more that are coming out next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| that are already wanting to follow in this career path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| So hopefully, their biweekly training that they have gone through has taught them enough about the profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| to where they want to join us and work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| They will all be living in reserves while they pursue their EMT, their paramedic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| and their associate's degrees along with their fire certifications in Level 1 and Level 2 from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| Most of these guys and girls, sorry, Sammy, have been explorers with us for about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| There's a couple, two, that have been in it since birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| They're all pretty special to me, all of them, because I've been their explorer advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| There's one that's a little bit more special. You'll probably figure out who he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| So let me introduce you to him. Jonathan Kidd, he came from Grace Christian Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| Sammy Johnson came from Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| Logan Bagwell came from Grace Christian Academy. That should tell you the rest, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| Alex Gregory, who is not with us, from Grace Christian Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| and Nick Johnson from Halls High School, and his dad was also a firefighter with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| He now works at ORNL in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| All of these young people have a servant's heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| They all want to serve their fellow man and their brethren in the community, which I think is to be commended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| And they've all shown great dedication over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| So we wanted to bring them to you and let you know that we're hiring our own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| Some of them are our own kids, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| So I want to introduce them to you and tell you that if you ever have any questions, we're always here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| and please don't be afraid to ask us. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| Our next presentation is a presentation of the 2020 review report by our own district attorney, General Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3834)|
| 1:04:03| General Allen, if you would please state your name and department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| Thank you, Commissioner Sharm Allen, Knox County District Attorney General's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| I'd just like to start by telling you, first of all, our office is, even though we are the Knox County District Attorney's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| as most of you know, we are actually a state office. It is really the sixth judicial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| Our particular office is very fortunate to be funded both by the state and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| You provide about 40 percent of our budget every year. We're 60 percent state funded, about 40 percent county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| We're very appreciative of that and could not do what we do without that funding, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| As far as the year-end review, I wanted to give you a brief overview to help you better understand what you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| because you actually have the year-end review with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| But just so you'll know, our office right now has 82 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| Forty-two of those are assistant district attorneys. The other 40 are support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| Support staff consists of secretaries, victim witness coordinators, and criminal investigators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| and that staff also is split about 60-40 state, county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| As you look through the year-end report, you'll notice that there's a lot of information about units in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| and I wanted to take just a minute to explain to you what a unit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| With those 42 assistant district attorneys, instead of letting each of those assistant district attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| prosecute all different types of crime, we have divided the office so that we have, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| little mini law offices within our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Each little mini unit specializes on a particular type of crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| the theory being that if a unit prosecutes the same type of crime all the time and is trained in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| they will be better prepared to actually address that particular type of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| We have eight specialized units in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| For example, we have a child abuse unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| They prosecute nothing but child sexual and physical abusers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| There are four lawyers in that unit, and just to give you an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| we prosecute way more sexual abuse crime in Knox County than we do physical abuse crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| We also have an elder abuse unit where the prosecutors and victim witness coordinators in that unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| focus on nothing but crimes involving persons over 65 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| I'm very proud to tell you that Knox County has the very first elder abuse unit in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| We created that when I took office back in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| It is a sad fact that in 2014 there was no district attorney's office in the entire state focusing on elder abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| but we have since remedied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| Since we began our unit in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| most other district attorney's offices around the state have now used our program as a model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| and we have elder abuse units in most all prosecutor's offices throughout the state now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| We have a domestic violence unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| Every single year our domestic violence unit has more cases than any other unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| In Knox County you're averaging about 1,700 domestic violence prosecutions per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| That is definitely the busiest unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| You will see that as you look through the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| We have a major crimes unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Our major crimes unit handles, as the name says, our most major crimes, which are homicides, rapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4041)|
| 1:07:30| That particular unit handles about 180 cases a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| A much lower number, but as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| a case where we're dealing with a murder takes much longer to process and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| and get through the system than a DUI, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| You'll notice that we also have a drug unit, a major crimes drug unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| The drug unit is extremely busy, unfortunately, in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| The number one drug for the last several years running here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| that has been found in all of our fatal overdoses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| and also the crime that we prosecute the most is fentanyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| We definitely have an uptick and problem with fentanyl here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| We have a career gang unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| That unit prosecutes nothing but people who have turned their lives to crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| and become a career offender or they're a gang member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| Here in Knox County presently, we have over 30 identified gangs in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| and we have over 1,500 adult identified gang members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| We have a DUI unit that prosecutes, obviously, DUI crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| I will tell you that over the course of my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| DUI crimes have changed dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| When I first began years ago, all DUIs involved alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| Now the vast majority of our DUIs involve a combination of alcohol and drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| and many of our DUIs are completely drug-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| We also have a white-collar unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| White-collar unit prosecutes our fraud crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| and is also the unit where we get the most restitution paid back in our white-collar crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| Those are our eight specialized units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| As you look through our year-end review packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| you will find that there is something called the Felony Sessions Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| The Felony Sessions Unit is basically what's left over all crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| that don't fit into one of those special eight categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| and our Felony Sessions Unit carries a large percentage of our load every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| The Felony Sessions Unit really is left with things like aggravated assaults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| and home break-ins, car break-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Mostly burglaries and aggravated assaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| When you see that Felony Sessions, you'll know that's what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| We also have, starting in 2020, at the beginning of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| I appointed Justin Pruitt, which is one of my assistant district attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| to be our mental health prosecutor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| We desperately need a mental health court in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| and I'll just take this time to lay that out there and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| we deal with so many things in our office that really aren't criminal per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| They really are mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| and because we don't have a specialized court here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| I appointed an ADA to deal with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| I will tell you, during COVID, he was the busiest ADA I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| dealing with mental health crisis issues throughout the year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| We are addressing the mental health issue with one particular prosecutor in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| but it would be wonderful to have a mental health court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| where we could so much better serve the citizens of our community if we had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| We also have a juvenile unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| Those prosecutors and victim-witness coordinators are not located here in the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| They are located off Sutherland Avenue at the juvenile facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| There are four people in that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| We serve by far the most victims in our domestic violence unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| as well as that felony sessions unit I was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| where we have the aggravated assaults and the home break-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| Just to give you a quick overview of what happened with our office during COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| the same thing happened with us as everyone else in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| COVID affected us tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| On March 13 of last year, the Supreme Court put down an order shutting down courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| except for a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| The few things that they left running were all the things we prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Our criminal courts, our sessions courts, continue to operate through COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| We had to figure out a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| We shifted to technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| I would like to take this time to put in a huge plug for Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| They worked so well with us getting us up and running and suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| I sent most of my support staff home with computers to be able to work from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| All of my lawyers had to come in and go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| We continue to run criminal courts and sessions courts throughout COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| We took a huge hit because our numbers and our percentages changed so much last year during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| I will tell you that usually we prosecute somewhere between 42,000 and 55,000 cases a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| Last year during COVID, we prosecuted or brought 35,000 new criminal charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| So our charges here in Knox County were down by about 17 percent, the actual arrests and charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| What we were able to dispose of was down 30 percent because our courts were running so much more sporadically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4346)|
| 1:12:34| Across the board, we were down about 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| Out of our grand jury, we brought out 42 percent less cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| because we just couldn't have the grand jury meeting during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| So we are dealing with a backlog right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| The biggest backlog and the biggest hit we took was in trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| We average about 80 trials a year in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| Last year during COVID, we had 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| So you can imagine we have a significant backlog in trials right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| and that's what is going to take us the longest amount of time to dig out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| As far as looking at 2021 and priorities coming up in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| it's no surprise to anyone in this room that we are dealing with gun violence in our community and homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| Last year saw our highest number of homicides in recent history and that was 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4399)|
| 1:13:27| So we ended last year with 45 homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Right now, as of today, we're sitting at 33 for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| So I suspect that we will surpass last year's record-breaking year, unfortunately, with homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| I also want to focus on mental health this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| As I've already mentioned, we really need to deal with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| Also, the overdose deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| That has been something that we've been struggling with in the criminal justice system and as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| In 2017 and 2018, we averaged about 300 overdose deaths a year here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| In 2019, we had finally gotten a handle on that through a lot of things our office focused on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| as well as the community as a whole, both the mayor's All for Knox initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| Many things were coming together to where we really, in 2019, saw a decrease in our overdose deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| We were down to about 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| Well, last year during COVID, all of that turned around and we lost 383 people to overdose deaths during COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| which was our highest year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| As of today, our overdose deaths sit at 248, which means we will probably surpass this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| last year's record-breaking overdose death total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| So, homicides and overdose deaths are two things that we are really struggling with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| I'd like to close by telling you that my community affairs unit has something that we call the Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| Every fall, Commissioner Jay has been through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| And I would like to invite each of you, if you want to learn more about our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| more about what we're doing to fight crime in our community, to sign up for our academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| We're taking applications this week, and the academy is August 31st through October 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| and it's for two hours on a Tuesday night for those seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| So, I would invite any of you to please join us and really get an inside look at what our office does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| and what it is that we're able to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| So, with that, I will close, and if there are no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Thank you, General Allen, and I will say that that academy was eye-opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| It was informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| It was a little scary at times, and it gave a great perspective on our justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| I want to open the floor to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| I just have one question myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Can you talk to us a little bit about the pretrial release program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| It wasn't more than about a year and a half ago that we were having substantive discussions about overcrowded jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| and that was leading up, of course, to our pandemic beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| and we had talked about the pretrial release program and some of our processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| but then it ramped up in short order, and I'd love to know just a little bit about the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| and how it's going, but also are you tracking in data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| and what information are you garnering as this continues to know is it an effective tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| We have all kinds of information and data that we're gathering on our pretrial risk program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| A couple of years ago, what we did here in this community was launch something called a pretrial risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| That is a tool that we came up with, I think it's been two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| that now everyone that comes through Knox County and is booked has a pretrial risk assessment done on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| to determine what level basically of threat they are to the community, what their bond should be set at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| That pretrial risk assessment has caused our pretrial numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| people that are actually placed on pretrial release or ROR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| ROR means release on your own recognizance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| Those numbers have gone up significantly, meaning that fewer and fewer people who are charged with a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| are actually being housed in our jail right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| That kind of goes hand in hand with an order that all eight of our judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| our three criminal court judges and our five sessions judges, have had a pretrial order in place throughout COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4642)|
| 1:17:30| That order mandates that all people that are brought into custody with a misdemeanor charge or an E, D, or C felony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4650)|
| 1:17:40| are to be looked at first for an ROR, a release on their own recognizance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| followed by a pretrial, being placed on pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| Because of those orders, our jail numbers are down significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| They are starting to creep back up as we start to run courts and people don't show up to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| Those numbers are creeping back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| But our jail numbers have been down significantly based on that pretrial risk assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| which is now done in conjunction with that ROR order that has been signed by our judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| So pretrial right now in Knox County is working overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| because the majority of our offenders are placed on pretrial at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| When will you know is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| Is it having the results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Are people showing up in the numbers that we expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| I mean, when will you have sort of an assessment of should we double down on that or adjust it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| It's going to take some time to give you an honest answer on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| because the numbers are so skewed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| The reason for that is because of COVID and because the court system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| the things we have done during COVID have really skewed those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| We have not been placing anyone under arrest that did not show up to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| We have started to do that now that the courts are back open and running full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| And so more and more people are being picked up on those no-show orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| And because of just the significant swings in courts opening and closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| and who was being taken into custody and who wasn't in response to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| that data, I really believe, we have it, but it's not a true picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| So it's going to take us at least six months to a year, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| of looking at that data once we really get out of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Commissioners, are there other questions for General Allen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| Thank you for the information, and I know your office is available if we have any follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| All right, we will move on to public forum for agenda-related items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| Once again, if you have signed up for a non-agenda-related item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| you will be called on in the second half of our public forum towards the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| Our first speaker for an agenda item is Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| Mr. Hill, if you would join us at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| And if you would, please state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| And you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Kevin Hill, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| So I'm here because we have an expenditure that's here for you to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| It may be historically kind of a rubber stamp pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| But in this current environment, nothing should be a rubber stamp pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| And that's the funds to Knox County schools via the health department for the nursing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| That would put, through a department that has been demonstrated to exercise incompetency, half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4831)|
| 1:20:40| So until you all have had scrutiny on that properly executed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| we've had a first examination, and it was very damning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| You know, we've been very critical and very concerned about our health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| and its policies and procedures for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| And it goes beyond the ones that we've been here mostly speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| And it goes to the massive amount of outsourcing that occurs with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| The reason why I'm bringing that up in this particular agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| is because normally there's one of two reasons why an individual outsources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| They outsource because they are extremely competent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| and they understand how to evaluate what the private sector can do better than themselves and manage it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| Or they outsource en masse because they know they're incompetent and incapable of running programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| and don't want to bear the responsibility and the burden of that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| If the first were true of our health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| then we would not have seen the report that we saw the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| So when you have massive bureaucratic failures in an organization where they do retain responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| that's evidence that their outsourcing is the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| They are trying to avoid accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| and they don't want to be responsible for the things that are put under their authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| They want plausible deniability by moving it out to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| The reason why this has bearing is, once again, whether it's a rubber stamp passed through or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| it's still through this individual's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| And so every time a dollar of Knox County is spent that's attached to this individual's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| it requires you to exercise scrutiny of the greatest order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Next person signed up for an agenda item is Debbie Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Ms. Stafford, if you would please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| Debbie Stafford is not with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Ms. Garrett, if you would please state your name and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| and you have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| I have before you to vote on this week a memorandum of agreement between Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| and Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| This is to approve $525,051 for positions in the in-school health program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| Part of your job is to approve budget items for the Knox County Schools and Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| With a recent evaluation coming out regarding the lax policies in Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| and their leadership, I'm hesitant to believe any partnership with our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| and our children with this health department is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| Knox County Health Department has not seen a patient in years since Marthie Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| sought a partnership with Cherokee Health Systems who now sees all indigent patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| Since they do not have the ability to see patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| I do not understand why they need to have access to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| As I stated last week, there is no reason for Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| to oversee the nursing staff in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| If a physician is needed, the parents have a right and responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| to seek out their own pediatrician or medical practitioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| and most parents already have that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| If a parent does not seek medical care for their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| that is a social services issue and not a health department issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| If a child's physician writes an order for a child to receive medication or treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| the nurse follows that order as long as it is not outside her scope of practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| As I've stated previously tonight, your job is to approve the budget items for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| One of you told me a while back that you approve the budget and give the schools a blank check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| One of the school board members was recently heard saying during a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| It's our money. We can spend it the way we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| That's disturbing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| This is not their money. These are taxpayer dollars that are being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| And since this body is the one that approves budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5066)|

| 1:24:33| Why were there some school board members willing to spend $50,000 on a facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| for the Knox Police Department, MOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| Thankfully, it was voted down, but this legislative body in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| has the responsibility of dispersing taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| I'm asking that you send it back with a suggestion they reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| and consider putting nurses in every school instead. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Our last agenda item speaker is Mr. Vernon Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| Mr. Henry, if you would please state your name and your county residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| You have five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| Good afternoon, Vernon Henry, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| My statements here are my opinion and my opinion only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| They are not based upon any group I may or may not be affiliated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| Last week, I came in to speak about a holiday provision that was actually being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| Holidays should bring us together, not segregate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| While all communities have special days, not everyone celebrates those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| I'm not saying that you should not be allowed to celebrate those special days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| I'm saying that a provision of a tail wagging the dog should be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| Instead of you voting on this, I would like to make the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| that if any community desires a holiday to be set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| I would recommend that they seek the provision of having it placed upon the next available general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| to be voted upon by the populace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| Simply said, taking the responsibility from this board to the general populace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5176)|
| 1:26:24| Let them make the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| On a separate area, I would like to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| that the current director of health department, Ms. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| be placed on unpaid administrative leave until the current investigation is concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| Once again, that takes the responsibility away from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| puts it where it should be, and puts some minds at ease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| All of us in the community are now aware that the advisory board is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5213)|
| 1:27:01| I'm sure you're painfully aware of the same group held the county hostage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| 470,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| They held it with a narrative and their view of science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| This group of Cerberus need to be exiled and Medusa needs to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| from the ability to turn our community to stone once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| Too many families cannot afford another lockdown nor another mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| And if I'm boring a few of you, start paying attention to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| They need your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| They need you to basically pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| They cannot afford another lockdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| We cannot afford to lose any more businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| We cannot afford any more of the problems that go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5267)|
| 1:27:54| Please pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| I may not like what I have to say, but listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Thank you, Mr. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| I just said thank you, Mr. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Oh, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| Is Mr. Streetman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| Ezekiel Streetman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Mr. Mills here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| Mr. Mills, I'm going to go ahead and just have you come up now and we'll ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| and you're going to be here a long time if we push to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| So I'm going to use a little discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| Is Ezekiel Streetman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| That's the only other person that had signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| Mr. Mills, if you would please state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| You have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Greg Mills, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| I want to talk to you about your social media policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| When I look at the county's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| there are basically two providers and platforms you seem to be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| And since the pandemic began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| they've been kind of called out as implementing a lot of censorship policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| So I'd ask that for your August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| you consider at the very least adding a third platform that allows, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| the full range of constitutionally protected speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| and not just what, you know, the bots and algorithms in San Francisco allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| I think you need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| And there's, you know, I don't have any particular recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| as long as it allows for all kinds of protected speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| But again, you know, if the government wants to engage in social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| you know, it needs to respect everybody's constitutional rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| not just a handful or even 90% of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| So I would, like I said, I would ask that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| whatever procedure you need to make to put it on the August agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| to really update your social media policy to include everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| So that's really what I came down here to say tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| Thank you, Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| Okay, last call for Mr. Ezekiel Streetman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| That concludes our public forum for the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5399)|
| 1:30:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| We're on to G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| This is the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| Those are sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| Second by Commissioner Beeler, first by Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| We have no line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| We have no budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| Notary applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| We have 179 notary applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| Second by Commissioner Durrett, first by Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| to approve 179 notary applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Next item is the spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| The spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| The Knox County Mayor's order reappointing George Agove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| to the Lenore City Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| I'm going to take care of one item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| just as a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| This is item number 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| We voted to defer that as the full agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| and I just want to take a voice vote to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| That was a late request that came in just before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| Our rules state that the ask for a deferral has to come in in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| but also if the applicant had not showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| we would have just given that as a courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| So we did put it as the whole package of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| but I just would like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| I'd like to make a motion to defer number 55 per the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| We can do it now, but I think it would be more chronological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| to wait until it comes up in the zoning section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| We'll just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| It's inside zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| We'll do that when we get to zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5534)|

| 1:32:16| We're on to consent calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Commissioner Daly, we're on to the education consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| I do not believe we have to read them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| Just make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| Motion to approve the schools and government consent calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| Second by Commissioner Beeler, first by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| This is to approve the education and the government consent calendar en masse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Those items have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| Next item, Madam Clerk, what number are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| 46 was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5589)|
| 1:33:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| So I believe we're 47 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| These are ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| The first is Ordinance O-21-7-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 10, entitled Personnel Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| to amend Section 2-756, Holidays, to add Juneteenth Independence Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| to the list of holidays observed by county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Ordinance number O-16-8-101, adopted September 26, 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5632)|
| 1:33:59| and O-19-3-101, adopted April 22, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| I entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| A motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Second by Commissioner Lundy, first by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Is there discussion on item number 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| I got to sit down with the mayor and the mayor's staff and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| and kind of get everybody on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| and kind of iron out the details of this a little bit better since last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| So as a legislative body, we can put this on the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| we can make this one of the county-recognized holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| and it is available to be a paid holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| but the executive branch actually makes it a paid holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| and they pick every fiscal year from the paid holiday lists that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| and acknowledge those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| So once this gets passed in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| it would actually not be able to be recognized until next fiscal calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| and at that point in time the executive branch would actually make the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| and when talking to the mayor and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| they're going to poll the employees for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| and wait for state guidance before they make the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| but we have a year until that decision would have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| At this point in time, when we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| it will be just recognized as a county holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| and they'll be eligible to be paid day off if the executive branch chooses so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| Commissioner Skidmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Thank you for that, doing the research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| One other suggestion I was going to make was that Knox County has a benefits committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| which is comprised of employees from different departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| and it might be worth it to get it on their agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| so they have an opportunity to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| particularly if they're going to have to lose one holiday in favor of another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| and then that way we do get the employee interaction before we take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| So you may want to reach out to that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| and see if they would like to meet prior to our August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| I think when having lunch with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| he was going to poll everybody and talk to that committee and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| He's got a year before he has to make a decision on what to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| or how to recognize, but it will be a county holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| Commissioner Schmidt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Commissioner Skidmaker, is that a benefits committee or the insurance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| There's actually a benefits committee that's actually the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| is out of the trustee's office that does the record keeping for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| Linda McGinnis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| I was wondering if we are going to make this an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| Is there anything in this ordinance that binds this, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5807)|
| 1:36:56| the line that states county employees will observe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5816)|
| 1:37:05| Is that a question for the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Mr. Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| As I understand and read this, it's an observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| whether it's a paid holiday or not, is, as Commissioner Ward said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| that's going to be up to the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| We now have, I think, 12 paid holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| and if the mayor or the executive branch wants to substitute one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| for next year's budget, he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| But now it's not a paid holiday, and that's not what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| That answers the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| I want to read the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| You can speak more into your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Sorry, it's just hard to hear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| Give me one second here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5871)|
| 1:38:04| This is first reading, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Can we check on that before the second reading to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| anything in the language doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| Do we have past ordinances for holidays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| We do have an ordinance with 12 paid holidays, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| And it says 12 paid holidays, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| It lists them, and it doesn't say 12, but it lists them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| If you count up, it's 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| So at some point we'll have to go back and amend that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| if this one's chosen over one that's already listed within the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| If you want to put that in there as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| then you would simply go in and substitute that later down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| at the desire of the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| It would be just more of a clerical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Any further discussion on item number 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| Seeing none, this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| It will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=5947)|

| 1:46:08| I don't know which way is the better procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| I've already asked earlier that we add in the bold and underline section D under qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6372)|
| 1:46:23| And I asked earlier to have the underlined part, and they shall not hold any elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| or appointed office within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| I went back to the law department and asked them, is there any current verbiage that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| using in any other subcommittee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| So, under the ethics committee, we have other verbiage that we use pertaining to that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| topic, and we went through that and asked, does that even cover everything enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| So, the point that I'm going to be making here in a second is that we're trying to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| the politics out of this merit council, the board and the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| So, I would like to add the following after the and they shall not hold any elected or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6419)|
| 1:47:06| appointed office within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| After that, I'd like another sentence added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| And this is partially from the current verbiage from the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| In the event a voting member of the merit council has appointed a campaign treasurer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| or submits a candidate nomination petition to the Knox County Election Commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| be a candidate for an elected office in Knox County, then that member shall immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| resign as the voting member of the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| Okay, so this is a, just to clarify, I want to clarify, this is a substitute motion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| item number 50 to include additional language on area D, which is qualifications that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6461)|
| 1:47:52| currently reads, all members of the merit system council must be over 21 years of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| of good moral character, a citizen of the United States, and the state must reside in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| the county and they shall not hold any elected or appointed office within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| And please reread yours and write it to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| I can give this to the clerk as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| So, the verbiage I would like to put in there is, in the event a voting member of the merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| council has appointed a campaign treasurer or submits a candidate nominating petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| to the Knox County Election Commission to be a candidate for an elected office in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| County, then that member shall immediately resign as a voting member of the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| My thought process behind this is, once you become a political agent or a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| you're now able to take money from people to influence your votes on things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| going to come in front of you to be judged on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| So, and you're also going to be a potential elected official somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| We already don't want elected officials being on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| So, the thought process here is to eliminate any kind of favoritism or influence from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| outside money or outside candidacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| Director Book, would this be a substantial change or could this be added as a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| motion without?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Just double checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| You can amend it as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| So, that is a substitute motion from Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Open up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| We already have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| What you've done under the policies and procedures...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| You've got a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| What you've done under the policies and procedures is taken number D and just expanded on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| So, that makes it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Acknowledged to the merit council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| So, it does make it, because it just says an elected position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| And this way, you're saying from the start, if you decide you're going to run for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| office...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Under the merit system policy and procedures, section 2, 2.3, section D is what you're referring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| And that there pertains to the rules that fall underneath merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| So, I'm holding them to the same rules that they have, that they hold everybody else to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| Director Book, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Did you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify that that rule they referred to is present in the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| rules as well as in the ethics policy rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| And what it refers to is that an employee who wants to run for an elected office upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6631)|
| 1:50:39| appointing a treasurer is then a political candidate and must...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| Take a leave of absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| He must then ask for a leave of absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| In fact, in the last mayoral race, that's what Commissioner Brad Anders had to do because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6649)|
| 1:50:58| they've got the same rule over there in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| He had to take a leave of absence as soon as he was going to run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| So, all this is doing, as Commissioner Ward says, is applying to the merit council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6667)|
| 1:51:14| the exact same policy that applies to the employees that it is representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6674)|
| 1:51:21| And this is the same standard we hold our ethics committee up to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| And the same standard as the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| Yeah, I was just trying to figure out, can you give me the exact section because I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| through our previous packet with the new highlighted areas since we switched up some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| Can you give that to me one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| This is page 2 of 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| This is, if you look at exhibit A, it would say, article 2, sheriff, division 2, employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6703)|
| 1:51:50| merit system, section 4253, merit system council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| And then if you go down to D, under qualifications, it is that third line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| And the language is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| It's been proposed to have been added by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| So, it currently reads, and they shall not hold any elected or appointed office within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| And he is adding language that he's pulled from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| Pulled from the ethics committee was the base of it, and then I pulled the other part from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| the actual rules of the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| And so if that substitute motion was adopted tonight on first reading, it would be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| to this ordinance, and then it would come back before us for a second reading and continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| We are discussing the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| I had one question on one word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| Word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| Under G...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| Speak into the mic, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| It's hard to hear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| Under G, where it says, the word there under has been struck, and here it now says here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6777)|
| 1:53:13| under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Can we ever get an explanation for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| I would defer to Jill, since she is the ultimate grammarian, and she may have a choice for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6801)|
| 1:53:29| reason or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| I'm not sure who made that change, but I mean, I guess here is the document here versus there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| There can be a different document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| Well, I think in that section, is it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| It used to say, make investigations concerning the enforcement effect of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| It says made here under, so in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| That's how I guess I would get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| I think it's here under because it's referring to the powers that the council has in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| in the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| I just want to make sure here under doesn't exclude any of the rules, because they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| be what I would call there under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| I think we'll get some further clarification on that before next month, but I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| Busser outlined it one time, and we all felt like it was the right word to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| It depends on what it's going to be interpreted to mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=6863)|

| 2:00:49| Is there a discussion on item number 52?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| This relates to the roles and responsibilities of recruiting for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7251)|
| 2:00:59| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| Is there someone here for the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| The Sheriff, I don't believe, can make it because of the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7266)|
| 2:01:11| I don't know if there's another representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| I'll see Hugh if he wants to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| Well, the question is, is the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| I apologize for saying department, Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| are they going to be using the Knox County system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| or do you all plan on using your own system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| That is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| And that's an important question because for this to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| the Sheriff's Office will need to use the county system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| and not come up with their own version of an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| Just a question, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| I'm sort of trying to figure out how this relates to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| because this is just about recruiting, not processing of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| So this is just about going out in job fairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| and going and promoting and advertising and marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| That was during our workshop that that would be part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| that they would use the recruiting tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| and the application process that Knox County IT has developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| That was discussed, but it's not part of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| I think it's still a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| I'm just trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| I'd like to verify that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| Mr. Holt, you can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| I would just like to know the funding aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| In the ordinance, is there a ceiling or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| Because, you know, earlier this or last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| there was a specific $600 bonus that was pushed in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| and I would just kind of like to know that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| So before we can get our answers, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| do you want to defer this for 30 more days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| or what do you want to do about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| The question, I just want to make sure I'm clarifying the question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| how will recruiting be paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| The previous discussions with the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| were that it would be included in their current budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| as adopted already by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| and they're not asking for additional appropriations for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| So that's not going to be taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Right now, that already sits in their current budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| They expressed that they would not be asking for additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| They would probably reallocate funding from other sources or savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| or, you know, there's all kinds of things that they use money from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| different seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| What I'm asking is where it is now and how much it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| That's all I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| I don't have an answer of what specific amount of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Mr. Holt, is there any information you can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| about a specific dollar amount that they've talked about using for recruiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| So they can get that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| And to answer your other question, I would not like to defer it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| I think that's some information that we can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| and we still have a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Is there additional discussion on item number 52?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Seeing none, this is also a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| Would you please call the vote, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7464)|

| 2:10:20| Ms. Brooks, if you would give us a staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7824)|

| 2:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7832)|

| 2:10:44| As Ms. Brooks indicated, the Planning Commission's recommendation by a vote of 13 to 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| was to approve this rezoning to plan residential at a density of four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| That is significant because the staff's recommendation was initially three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| and that was simply through an application of the growth policy plan, which limits extending densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7861)|
| 2:11:10| Mr. Mullins, hold on one moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| We have to swear everybody in for zonings now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7872)|

| 2:11:30| and repeat after me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| Anybody that's going to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7893)|

| 2:11:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| Okay, be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7903)|

| 2:12:08| while testifying as a witness under oath, shall be guilty of the offense of civil perjury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7928)|

| 2:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| As I indicated, the staff's recommendation was based upon the application of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7945)|
| 2:12:30| and after staff provided this recommendation, the applicant hired me to look into that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7950)|
| 2:12:37| And I wish I'd looked into this issue before because it actually surprised me in what I found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| I first went to this body's resolution in 2019 where it voted to reinstate the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7962)|
| 2:12:54| And in that resolution, the resolution specifically had a finding of fact that the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| which was passed initially in 2001, had expired on its own terms at the end of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7979)|
| 2:13:06| And I didn't know why it stated that, so I started digging a little deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| I reached out to the law director, David Boock, and asked him about that statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| and he provided an e-mail, which is in the record in the letter that I presented to planning commission on June 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| He stated that it is the law director's opinion that the growth policy plan is no longer in force or effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| because it expired under its own terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| So I went deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| I found a memo that the former law director, Bud Armstrong, had drafted where he reached the same conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| and he referred back to the original resolution that was adopted by the county commission in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8014)|
| 2:13:41| So I found that resolution, and sure enough, that resolution, all this is in the record attached to my letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| that resolution said that the growth policy plan shall expire on its own terms at the end of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8026)|
| 2:13:54| which goes back to why this body said to reapply and reinstate the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| Now, that hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| This body passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| The city of Knoxville passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Farragut blocked it, and so there's some still work to be done on what to do with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| But the resolution this body passed is also interesting as it relates to this issue today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| in that the resolution passed by this body eliminated sections 3.2 to 3.6 of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8054)|
| 2:14:21| You guys will probably remember this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| That is the part that talked about the limitations of extending densities greater than two dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8063)|
| 2:14:31| and up to three dwelling units an acre into the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| And what this body says, we shall let the sector plans decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| The sector plan in this case is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| Low-density residential in the county allows up to five dwelling units an acre, which is what the applicant asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| So I presented that to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| The planning commission then split the baby and decided to give us four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| And we are still here today asking for five dwelling units an acre, and I want to talk about that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| This piece of property is relatively unique in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| It's 8.7 acres, but it's not any hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| It's accessed by Old Tazewell Pike and Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| Old Tazewell Pike is a local road, but Murphy Road is a major collector with 34.1 feet of pavement and a 70-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8115)|
| 2:15:22| There's no question there's sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| There's infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| There's no question that this property can handle the infrastructure required for the density of five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| If you look back at the growth policy plan, this property is also unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| and immediately west of this property, across from Murphy Road, you're in the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| Right across this property, you're in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| To the north, just a little ways above Old Tazewell, you're again in the urban growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| Now, the growth policy plan provided in the past that it should be reviewed every three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| to determine if there needs to be an extension or a change of the categories of these planned growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8157)|
| 2:16:04| And you have to think that never happened over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| And you'd have to think this piece of property, surrounded by urban growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| would have at least been applied at a planned growth area, if not an urban growth area, over the last 20 years, had anybody reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8171)|
| 2:16:19| So, again, that also goes to supporting five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| And why is five dwelling units an acre important in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| It's only nine units when you look at the property itself, but that's nine units that this county desperately needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| It's been well documented that we are in a housing crisis, that we can't build them fast enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| that the costs of construction are skyrocketing, and we need affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| The plan for this property is to do attached units, which is a mixture of housing for seniors and housing for young families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8202)|
| 2:16:51| And the intent is to do it in a way that it is in that affordable range, and I laid out all that in my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| And in order to make that happen, you have to have economy of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8217)|
| 2:17:02| You have to deal with the infrastructure costs, the construction costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| and being able to do more of that at one time will help offset those costs to help allow a product to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8226)|
| 2:17:14| And we have also an urban sprawl problem, and this will also help solve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| because if we don't, if we lose nine units here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| we're going to be looking at some other farm further in the rural area to try to make up those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| to meet the 40,000 plus demand that has been documented that we need in this county over the next few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8245)|
| 2:17:32| and that has, I think, been underreported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| So with all of that, I would ask that you support Planning Commission's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| to allow the rezoning above three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| but to consider five dwelling units an acre is what the applicant originally asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| When the conversation was between four and five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| Eddie Smith was the Planning Commissioner that said, you know, he looked at the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| He kind of averaged out the density, and he came to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| Commissioner Tim Hill said, well, why not five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| And he said, well, you know, you're kind of looking at the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| There's seven dwelling units an acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| There's five dwelling units an acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| But on this side, there's three dwelling units an acre here for Shannondale Farms, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| But that was developed under the rural area where the staff was limiting it to three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8292)|
| 2:18:19| and that wasn't questioned then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| So I would ask that under these circumstances, in light of the opinion that I've received from the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8301)|
| 2:18:27| on the growth policy plan and the need for housing and affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| that you approve this up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| And I didn't see a timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| I didn't put a timer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| It's just the two of you all, so I'm going to just keep track of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| If I have any time, I'd like to be able to respond to anything Mr. Murphy has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| Mr. Murphy, I don't have a timer on you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| It's just the two of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| What I'm saying is don't worry about the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| I think we're going to have a substantive discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| So if you would, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| You'll notice that's the same road that this property is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| I'm here as chair of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| I'm actually really familiar with this property and this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| I've actually got ancestors buried in the church cemetery that's adjacent to this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| And as a point of fact, this property is not that unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| Every other piece, including the 50 acres I live on, meets all these same criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| The ACPA supports planning staff's recommendation of three units an acre that the staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8371)|
| 2:19:37| and not the four that commission recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| And land use, zoning, growth, and planning, these are big topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8380)|
| 2:19:47| They're emotional topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| Your vote tonight is a choice about how to govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| Our plans and ordinances give us a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| They also provide stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| Current residents, future residents, prospective employers know what they're buying into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| when they have stable plans and ordinances that are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| KCPA and many of your constituents want and encourage you to update our plans when they get outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| And we govern best when we do those updates as a process with a lot of public participation and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8416)|
| 2:20:22| Your other option is to make land use decisions item by item, piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| Throw out the plans, throw out the community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| throw out the advice and expertise of professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| That results in an unfair, unlevel playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| Some applicants have more influence with you than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| Some residents have more influence with you than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| That, however, is the other way to govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| If you vote for four units as planning commission recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| you vote against development policies in the growth plan and the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| Now, Mr. Mullins has argued the growth plan is no longer valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| We've read that same complicated agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| We think it is actually valid, but I'm not going to argue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| because that same one-to-three dwelling unit and acre limit in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| is also present as a development policy in the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| which is copied verbatim into the North Cat City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| A vote for more than that would be contrary to Zoning Ordinance 6.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| which requires zoning ordinance map amendments to be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| and not conflict with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| Four units an acre or five units an acre conflicts with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| So you can see the people here tonight on another item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| that are asking you to uphold the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| So you arbitrarily vote on this item against the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| then on another item to uphold the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| We ask you to be consistent with upholding our plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| and then when those plans get outdated, which, yes, the growth plan is outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| and the general plan is outdated, and we want to update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| We want to have that conversation, but we don't want to do it piece by piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| So, sure, the parcel is adjacent to the urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| It's on a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| There's sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| And the difference, like, from three to four is nine houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| and from three to five is 18 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| It doesn't seem like that big of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| But what is a big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| What criteria are you going to use to decide when something is a big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| There is a request already on the August planning agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| to rezone 108 acres on Babley Road to four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| That's 108 acres in the rural area in the 8th Commission District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| that is asking for something against the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| So if you vote tonight for four units or five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| then how are you going to evaluate that 108-acre request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8558)|
| 2:22:41| when it comes before you in a few months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| How do you say no to them and yes to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| So I know a vote for four units an acre instead of three seems like a small difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| But I want to be clear, this is a really big leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| They're asking you to vote against the general plan and the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| A process has been started to update the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| and we ask you to keep the playing field level for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| support the update process, support the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| and for now support three to one units an acre as recommended by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| and as set as policy in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8590)|
| 2:23:11| I'm going to just hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| I'm going to open the floor for questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| and then I'll sort of give you both a final statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| Is there any questions of anybody, Mr. Murphy or Mr. Mullins from anybody on commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8598)|
| 2:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Well, Mr. Mullins, I'll give you a few minutes for rebuttal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| and then Mr. Murphy, if you want to cap it off, and we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| Mr. Murphy and I find ourselves in agreement on this area that the plans do need to be updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8613)|
| 2:23:42| and it's especially important in the environment that we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| I do disagree with him that looking at these matters on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8626)|
| 2:23:52| he somehow implied that that was inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| and I think because every piece of property is different, every piece of property is unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| it has to be looked at a case-by-case basis within the standards that are in existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| and the resuscitation of these standards in the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| is only a carryover from what the growth policy plan initially adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| and if the underpinnings have been taken out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| then that portion of the general plan, I would assert, is no longer enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| just like the growth policy plan is no longer enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| It expired on its own terms in 2007, and so I would respectfully disagree with that, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8662)|
| 2:24:31| I know Mayor Jacobs has taken up the mantle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| He tried to get the growth policy plan changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| He tried to get it updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| and it wasn't this body's fault that we're talking about this here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| If that had happened the way it should have, then this argument would be completely off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| but it didn't. Farragut blocked it, and so we have to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| and we have to update the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| but here we're continuing to kick the can down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| and create more sprawl and exacerbate a housing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| We have an opportunity for a piece of property like this, which is flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| which has the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| Everybody agrees that. Staff agreed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| Mr. Murphy agreed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| It can accommodate this density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| and so we, as a body, we need to vote to approve it at a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| the four dwelling units that Planning Commission recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| but under these considerations, I still think five is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| and I ask for that vote. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| The general plan not only carries over things from the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| but it also sets out density for planned growth area, urban area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| things that aren't in the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| so there's more intentional work in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| The reason this is really important is if you give an applicant what they're asking for here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8748)|
| 2:25:53| and you say we're going to do it piece by piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| that takes away any incentive to update the plans or in the future to follow the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| so we really, if you go against the plan right now and against your own zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8760)|
| 2:26:07| then why have a plan in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| I think Mr. Mullins kind of touched on what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| Director Brooks, when was the vote to update the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| and to initiate a new general plan taken by this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| Any of you all remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| With the amendment, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| 2019, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Does that sound correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| Sounds correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| If that plan had not been blocked by Town of Farragut and members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8803)|
| 2:26:49| we would probably be under a new general plan by now, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| We're very close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| I don't believe at that time there was discussion about updating the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| Oh, there was. We funded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| Again, that was under my predecessor in terms of those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| but obviously now, as everybody knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| we are getting ready to undertake an update to our new comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| This commission was prepared to move forward so that we would be more prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| for this type of stuff, and we weren't allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8843)|
| 2:27:29| Mr. Murphy, we can't stand still with what we have going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8849)|
| 2:27:37| with the number of dwellings we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| and if we can't get help from the public to try to come up with a new growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8860)|
| 2:27:45| and a new general plan, we're left with no choices but to piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8865)|
| 2:27:52| I really wish you would join us in trying to get a growth plan passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| so that we could come back, sit down, and work through these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| I mean, they were supposed to meet every three years to update this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| Twenty years is a long time, given what's happened in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| not to touch a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8887)|
| 2:28:14| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| We were asking for an update to the growth plan three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| when that resolution went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| The update we were looking for is something that actually updated the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| updated the boundaries, and had thoughtful discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8906)|
