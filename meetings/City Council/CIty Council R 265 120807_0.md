| 0:03:30| Okay, for the mayor's report, first I'd like to welcome the Boy Scout Troop 155.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| They're here from halls, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| Hopefully this will be of interest and you'll learn something about local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| Also, a couple other things I wanted just to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| Recently we've had two new retail stores open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| One is Target, a new location for Target, and I know many of you are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| And just last week Publix entered the local market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| and there was a huge showing of people wrapped around the building very early in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| and we are happy to have them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| And just on Thursday, or Friday of this week, at 755 in the morning at Suburban Center in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=256)|
| 0:04:25| Trader Joe's will also have a grand opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| So I know they'll be glad if everyone comes out for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| I know many of us will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| So we want to welcome these new companies, Publix and Trader Joe's, to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| I also want to make sure that council and the public remembers that we are applying to the Bloomberg Philanthropies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=280)|
| 0:04:51| This is Mayor Bloomberg from New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| He has a philanthropic organization, and they have what they call the Mayor's Challenge Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| And what they are doing is soliciting proposals from cities across the country for innovative civic solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=303)|
| 0:05:12| They are focusing on sustainability and public health, education and economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| new policies and programs that could be pioneering ways to move the country forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| They are actually giving a $5 million award to the city that is selected as the best idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| and four other cities will receive a $1 million award each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| So we have RSVP'd and said that we expect to submit an idea, and our staff is working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| but we've invited the public to also submit your creative ideas, ways to make Knoxville better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| And we have a survey on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| If you go to the cityofknoxville.org website, you'll see the Mayor's Challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| It's in purple, and there's a little area you can click to get to our survey where you can submit your ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| There's also contact information for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| So we're looking for bold ideas and creative and innovative approaches to solve different issues in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| so we hope you'll participate and share your ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Also, we sent out a press release today that our Parks and Recreation Department is accepting applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| for the 2012-13 Challenge Grant Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| This offers grants to nonprofit projects associated with public parks or recreation facilities within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| We have a total of $25,000 in the budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| It's available to community groups, homeowners associations, schools, scout troops, and other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| And the city will reimburse 50% of the cost of a single project up to $2,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| so you have to raise the rest of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Previously, the grants have been used for playground equipment, water fountains, benches, and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| That's just some of the ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| So again, go to our website, cityofknoxville.org, slash recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| and the application and the different grant instructions are online there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| So we encourage community groups and others to get together and apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| Mayor, there's a deadline. Is that like September 15th or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Thank you. Let's see. I should say the deadline on both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| We are collecting on the challenge, wait a minute, on the Parks and Recreation Grant, that deadline is September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=451)|
| 0:07:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Thank you. And then on the Mayor's Challenge Grant from the Bloomberg Philanthropies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| we need your ideas between now and August 10th, so just a couple more days on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| And finally, in a few minutes, you all will acknowledge the new Business Advisory Council that we have appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| as a part of the Office of Business Support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| I want to make sure that you all know and the public knows that we have information about the Office of Business Support online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| and our business liaison, Patricia Robledo, has put together a business resource guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| which lists all kinds of information that might be helpful to someone who is starting a business in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| or wanting to expand, and includes who to call in the city, but also other resources as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| So we hope folks will go online, and we'll find that resource and utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| And that, I believe, is all that I'm going to report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you, Madam Mayor. I've got a couple of announcements here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| A real exciting announcement, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Coming up Thursday, the 9th, I would invite folks throughout the city to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| I guess it's the first level where the terrace is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| I was thinking it was second, but I guess it's the first level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Upstairs here, we'll be having an announcement about the JFG sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| and a special announcement about incentives for some South Knoxville businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=546)|

| 0:17:43| What happens, Councilman, is, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| we've got to make sure that the current location is suitable to build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1066)|

| 0:19:33| I'm just curious, what kinds of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Oh, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| What kinds of things are we going to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Because this is part of that downtown north redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| It would be an extension, Councilman Dallavalpi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| of the work done on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| That's the remaining block to connect downtown north into Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| and back into downtown, the block that goes north of Regas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| So it would be a narrowing of the street, more pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| pedestrian friendly with plantings and so forth in concert with the other improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| So we're going to kind of pump a little life into the surroundings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and help the businesses survive and do well there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| That's definitely the idea, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1208)|

| 0:20:17| They did your block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Well, they did the block before Emory Place, Mr. Dallavalpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| And then they've also gone down as far as Regas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| So this completes actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| This is the middle section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| And it completes us from the Gay Street Bridge all the way now down to Emory Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| so that all of Gay Street will be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1234)|

| 0:21:22| that maybe they could explain a little bit about this particular request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| We'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Yes, this is a retention of jobs move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| As you know, Kimberly Clark was downtown and made an independent decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| that the downtown facility didn't work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| and partially on that not fitting their business model of owning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| and serving as landlords in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Subsequent to that decision being made, we met with Kimberly Clark along with folks from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| We have Mr. Jacoby from Kimberly Clark here tonight along with Rhonda Rice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| who worked with us on this project from the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| to try to make sure that Kimberly Clark at the very least stayed in hopefully the region and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| and much more preferably in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| So in working with them and in their discussions, they identified the vacant commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| that's known as the Goodies Building that has been vacant for quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| and have proposed a substantial investment both into the build-out of the building of over $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| and then 4.5 of furnishings and fixtures to go ahead and complete their move to that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1347)|
| 0:22:35| What they've requested from us is a payment in lieu of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| a freezing of the taxes only on the personal property side, not on the real estate side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| for five years with the equipment that they're bringing with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| And following that, then the investment, the renewed investment in the 4.5 million would show up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| personal property tax assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| The administration has recommended that we, to the council, that you adopt this, that you agree to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| We think this retention of over 300 high-paying jobs in Knoxville of an important corporate citizen is well worth it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| and is something that is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| So we think that this is something that will not reduce our tax receipts in the future, leave them as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1397)|
| 0:23:26| delay our realization of the increased taxes on the investment for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| and most importantly retain hundreds of very good jobs and substantial payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| $26 million a year payroll in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| So just to be clear, they are going to continue to pay the personal property tax on what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| What we're putting aside is the new investment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| And then the other question I had, just to be sure, is that we're not setting a precedent here in terms of a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| with personal property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| The most visible one that we've had, we've had others, has been the new Sentinel site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| It was a somewhat similar situation where the Sentinel found that their downtown building was not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| The city at that time wanted to make sure they stayed within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| and a pilot on personal property was arranged for their location over there off of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Vice Mayor Pablos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| I would just like to dovetail a little bit off of what Bill has to say here about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| When I first read it, I'm like, you know, it rubbed me a little bit the wrong way, I'll have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| thinking that Kimberly Clark left downtown and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| But, you know, it's my understanding and confirmation from Bill that they work hand-in-hand with the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| that, you know, parking was just part of the problem, that it just didn't fit their business model anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| So they've made the decision not to only stay in the area but within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| And I think that that's real critical to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| I mean, this is a hard economic time, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| and there's a prospect of us losing jobs to Atlanta or Nashville or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| So, like Councilman Grieve, I mean, I've had questions from constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| and there's always questions about TIFs and pilots and this and that and other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| But, you know, the property that we're talking about is valued at $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| There's taxes that's paid on that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| It's about $500,000 that the city and the county splits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| So, you know, a portion of that building, as we all know or I'm aware of, has been or has remained vacant for quite some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| And I don't really know exactly if this could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| but my fear is that, you know, that that property would be downgraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| And there again, obviously, we're going to lose property taxes because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| So, you know, the ability to us, for us to retain a Fortune 500 company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| and not only that, it will be right on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Knoxville, as we all know, is one of the most heavily traveled interstates in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| And we'll have that presence of a Fortune 500 company right there every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| and all those people driving by and knowing that Knoxville is a business-friendly place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| We've already won awards in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| So, you know, again, that's one more reason for us to, you know, to approve this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| Bill touched on over 300 jobs, very good-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| And not only the jobs, but it won't affect their lives because these are people not everybody would want to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| They've got reasons to stay in Knoxville, kids, grandkids, or for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| So it's not only, you know, the good-paying jobs, but it's not disruptive to their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| In addition to that, I'm sure there's contractors that Kimberly Clark uses along the way probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| in the neighborhood of a company that size, 50 to 60 contractors that benefit as well in good-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| So that's a, you know, that's another real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| And the pilot is for $200,000, but remember, it's only $100,000 of exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| It's not really exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| We're not writing a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| All we're doing is forgiving, if you will, that portion of the personal property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| And, again, on what Bill said, they're going to pay what they're bringing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| And then the biggest portion, of course, is the real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| So I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| It's a great opportunity for this council to stand up and say that we certainly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| not only welcome those that are already here but for future companies to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| We've got an empty building, the former building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| You know, we've got the parking garage coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| So there's a great opportunity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| So, you know, this could really be a win-win situation for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| And I hope we'll support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor, Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| After the brief comments of Mr. Pavlis, I'm not sure I have anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| I, of course, join with him in the idea that this is an important step to keep this Fortune 500 company in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| For Dr. Lyons, I do have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| What is the limiting principle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| We're going to have other businesses say, well, they got something that I didn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| And how do we explain that or define that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Because I think that's an important thing, that you not treat folks differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| Obviously, this is a unique case somewhat because of the empty building and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| But would you go ahead and address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Well, what the company is, quote, unquote, getting is an abatement, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| of not paying the taxes on the new investment on the personal property for five years of a substantial investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| The only value for the payment in lieu of taxes is established by the investment that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| So I would say anybody who, you know, is dealing with the amount of economic impact, the amount of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| and one of our key concerns and one of our priorities is, of course, maintaining and keeping good jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| always is going to need the attention of, I know, the chamber in working with the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| and the administration in working for them to make that investment work and to retain or to attract jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| This is part of the portfolio of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| It's something that most smaller businesses don't pay that much in personal property tax in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| And, you know, there would have to be a substantial investment before an incentive like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| or an arrangement like this has any value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| And we're talking about a large investment for a large company with substantial numbers of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| So it's an incentivizing of the investment itself that's part of the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| And sometimes people look and say, well, the scope of the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| The scope of the dollars is understandable while people focus on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| but that is a direct function of the size of the investment that's being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| And I think that's the key point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Could I ask one follow-up, and that would be after the five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| there will be residual value that we will be taxing regularly after the pilot is over, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Yes, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| They will be bringing in substantial new investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| But, you know, it depreciates slightly, but what we're talking about is the amount of the new investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| as soon as that five years is up comes online of the personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Goes back on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| And we also would expect, we don't know what the appraisal will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| but with the improvements to the building that I think Councilman Pavlis pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| a very important point, leaving it vacant leaves the opportunity for it to decrease in value at assessment time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| Having not only it kept in use, but more investment in the building increases the likelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| that it will be appraised at a higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| I read that they were putting about $3.5 million in the refit of the building or re-outfitting of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I'm not sure I have a whole lot to say after everyone has spoken so eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| I will say this, that repurposing a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| and we've spent a lot of money on repurposing, refurbishing, developing downtown and the fringe areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| but to be going farther from the center city to repurpose a building that has great value to me is a real plus in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1858)|
| 0:31:06| Obviously the jobs, the Fortune 500 company, those have all been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| but I think we also need to look at the fact that we are going outside the center city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| to make a major investment and keep jobs and folks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| I, too, am going to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| but one of the questions that I posed to Mr. York was exactly how much money do we collect as a city from personal property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1884)|
| 0:31:34| And he said it's close to, well, it's a little over $7.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| And then the other question I had, which maybe is something to come up at a later time, is how do we really enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| I know I've been paying personal property tax on my business since the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and have never been questioned in terms of, you know, what do I really have and what I don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| We can make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| I'm sure you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| The audit committee will be taking that up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Where's the police chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| I think I need him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| The question is that it seems like that there is an area here where there's possible amount of income that maybe we're missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| and it's something that we can look to, like, oh, I see Councilman Swanson over there ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| I mean, counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Anyway, I just say that that may be something to look into to see how we really look at the collections on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| I really think that's a super idea, which is why we're doing that and why Doug Gordon and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| You're starting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Developing new and different mechanisms for collecting this particular type of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1956)|
| 0:32:46| It has been a tax that's been sort of difficult to assess and difficult to collect in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| but Doug has been working really hard at this, and he's doing a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| and he has provided me with a plan for how we're going to go about both assessing and collecting these taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| and I think that's going to be very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| According to the mayor, am I going to be the first example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| If you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| If you'd like to volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=1993)|

| 0:33:47| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923 of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2030)|

| 0:34:55| I'd like to hear from that person first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Okay, Ms. Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Please state your name and address, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| Anita Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I'm here on behalf of the General Government Employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I just want to call your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| First, I want to thank each of you for all the hard work we've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| I want to call your attention to three specific pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| One is the letter from the Pension Board on the report to City Council dated July the 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2123)|
| 0:35:32| and at the bottom of page 2, they have an exception recommending that language be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| That specific language appears twice in the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| Once is on page 6, subsection D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| The other is on page 24, subsection B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2148)|
| 0:35:58| We have had much discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| I've had many, many, many, many, many phone calls about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| It appears to a number of employees that the agreement that we reached when we had all the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2164)|
| 0:36:14| and the workshops with City Council, that part of that agreement has been reneged on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| I understand from talking with several people that this is supposed to apply to Plan H only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| The question is, why is it included in the general provisions up until the first time it appears?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| And I ask that you consider removing at least from the first time that it appears on page 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| and that you comply with the report from the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Thank you, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| I just wanted to say, you know, I guess everybody knows I'm not going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| And mainly, you know, I just don't feel it really gives the voters a real choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| You know, what I've said before, I think it gives the voters a choice between an expensive and risky plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| and a very expensive and risky plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| And I don't think that's a real choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| And the other issue I wanted to bring up and raise, and I don't think there's much we can do about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| but this question, this amendment does two major things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| It closes the current plan and it establishes a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| And it's all in one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| And so one of the problems we're going to have, no matter what the result is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| we're not going to really know where the voters are on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Because it's approved, it may be approved because people simply want to close the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| and they want this new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| And they may not like the new plan, but it, you know, it is a step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| so they may vote to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| People may vote against it because they want to keep the current plan open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| Or they may vote against it because they don't like the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| But we're not going to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| So if it's voted down, is it voted down because people want the current plan open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| or is it because they don't like the new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| So I think, you know, it's just something that's, you know, because the contrast is not great enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| I think we're really giving the voters an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| And that's something that's frustrated me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| And I've looked into how we could divide the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| and haven't been able to come up with something that's legal and simple enough for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| But I'd just like to raise that concern as one of the reasons I won't be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I have two amendments that I'd like to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| One is, in my opinion, a housekeeping item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| It's on Page 641 of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| It is under Section 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| This was the item that would go on the ballot if we choose to put it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2338)|
| 0:39:06| In the middle of that, it describes right in the middle a new defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| That's really what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| We need to say a new hybrid defined benefit slash defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| Let me repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Very good suggestion because it's misleading right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| In place of that, we need to put a new hybrid defined benefit slash defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| That's the first amendment I'd like to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Did you want to speak to that, Councilman de la Valle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| I think that's important because it's actually misleading the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| We all talked about a hybrid plan, and they'll wonder why it's a defined benefit plan only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| I think that's a very good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Councilman Starr, is your light on for that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Is the attorney, is it Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| I'd like him to address this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Sir, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I guess my first question is do you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| William Mason, 3560 Tlahe Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| And did you draft this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| No, I reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Is there any legal reason to have it this way or to not have it the way proposed by Councilmember Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2426)|
| 0:40:35| There's no reason not to have it the way Councilmember Saunders proposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| It is a – it is correctly described as a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| It's correctly described as a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| It's correctly described as a hybrid defined benefit slash defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| And any one of those three descriptions is technically accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| We've got a motion and a second, so we'll vote on that amendment to the resolution that's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2463)|
| 0:41:12| or to the ordinance that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| We have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| Okay, so the ayes have it, and that amendment has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| We have one more amendment, and this does come through me as a member of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| I do recommend the amendment that we delete subsections 1350.8D and 1381.7B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2495)|
| 0:41:49| What pages are those on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Well, I don't have the page numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| I have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| The two that Ms. Cash mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| It starts on page 622 of the packet, so 623, and then on page 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2516)|
| 0:42:10| On page 622, it's the subsection D, and it goes from about the middle of the page to the middle of the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2530)|
| 0:42:21| And on page 640, it's at the top, subsection B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| It takes up most of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| I believe Mr. Mason could probably explain why those were put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| These are actually provisions that I suspect most in this body had not seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| They did appear in front of the pension board, so you might want to make a comment about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2558)|
| 0:42:46| The amendatory language, both in the general section and in specific Plan H section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2566)|
| 0:42:59| follow language that the General Assembly included for local government plans that are adopting the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2579)|
| 0:43:13| The pension board, in its report, as Ms. Cash stated, the pension board's recommendation was that those sections be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2593)|
| 0:43:26| And I don't think that deleting those sections affects the qualification of the plan for IRS purposes or its placement in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2606)|
| 0:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Councilman Dallavopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Well, I was following along there until Mr. Mason said it doesn't affect its qualification under the IRS standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| That's really not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| The issue in the state statute that was presented to us was that in this day and age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| with the legislature saying that you can reserve the power to amend or change things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| especially in light of the fiscal difficulties that a lot of cities are facing with regard to pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| that such a clause allowing you to amend it in the future is prudent to have it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| In fact, I think Bud Gilbert stated to us during the workshops that it might even be malpractice in this day and age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| not to include that kind of language, not the specific wording, but that kind of language in a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| And it's in the county plan that was adopted in the mid-2005 time frame, not that exact wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| but the idea of the right to amend and correct something because we don't know where these things go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| We know that they can become unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| And the employer needs to, in this case, the voters need to be able to say, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| we didn't know these consequences were going to be as large as they turned out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| I want to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| And I don't know of any reason why it wouldn't be prudent to express that language in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| Now, whether it needs to be in two places or one, I don't know that it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| It's obvious we're talking about the only plan that will be open, and that's the new plan, Plan H, in terms of new entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| And that's where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| But I certainly wouldn't want to be in the city attorney's shoes standing in front of a judge saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| I had it in there and then I took it out, but I didn't mean to change my right to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| I think that would be a very foolish and shallow argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| And I think that it's important to have it in there, whether it needs to be in two places, as someone else has called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| But I think it's important to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| And I take it by your careful wording, you weren't saying anything other than it won't affect the tax viability of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| but not necessarily how one drafts a plan so that it has some future flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Is that fair to say, the last part, that it was the tax liability and not the flexibility of future action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| The language as proposed, I think, increases the city's future flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2761)|
| 0:46:11| But it's this body's judgment and the recommendation of the pension board as to whether it should be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| It's certainly not legally required to be included or legally required to be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| And we did ask the pension board to take a look at this and give us their comments and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| so that we could evaluate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| That was the process we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| And so now we're facing with the question of, should we leave it in as drafted or take it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| And I'm going to suggest to my colleagues that leaving it in, since it's the voters who decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| It's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| It's the voters who decide in the future if they want to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| What could be fairer than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| They're the ones adopting this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And I don't see any reason, fellow councilmen and women, that we would take that away from the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| especially if economic circumstances in the future that we don't know about now arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| So I'm going to urge that we leave it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| But thank you for explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Yes, just a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| I hope that as we go on through this process and as a former election worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| I know that we have to have the legal jargon, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| But I hope that this, when we get to the final drafting of the wording, that it is as plain as it can possibly be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2839)|
| 0:47:28| that it will not be confusing to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| And I just want to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Mayor Brown, I think that is addressed on Page 641, the item we just amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| because that is the language that is going to go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| And that is very plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| And according to Bud Gilbert, and I assume our city attorney, these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| the first change and the second change suggested, do not materially change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| So this wording is still valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| This is addressing the, I guess, the motion to remove this language that, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2890)|
| 0:48:19| that removes flexibility for the plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| I guess I had a question for Mr. Mason or Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Leaving the language in, does that do anything to affect sort of the Blackwell precedent that's already out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| It does not change the law of Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| The law of Blackwell, as announced by the Supreme Court, remains the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| And this statute does not in any way overturn Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| And it would still remain in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| That was my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| I would say to my colleagues, we're already really limited by this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| We went through these workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| We've talked about it ad nauseum of how limited we already are by Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Why would we want to limit ourselves more by taking this language out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| Just doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I mean, we're dealing with a fluid problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| We don't know if the problem is going to get better or get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| We don't know what the voters are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| You know, I think we should, you know, I'd say we should just leave it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| We're already limited enough by Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| The employees are protected by Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Why tie our hands more than we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| Did you want to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Yeah, I was just addressing originally the item that Finbar raised, but I would like to make a general comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| You know, we've struggled with this for quite some time and had workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| and really put our back to the problem and tried to get as much information as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| And I certainly think that I could say that it was a very fair process we engaged in to come up with an alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=2993)|
| 0:50:03| And I certainly think that the plan that's in this item 12B is better than what we have today in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| And for that reason, I think it's certainly a step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| I remain, and I have to switch gears a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| I have to remain still a little concerned about the idea that we retain the market risk aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| And that's something that I think Councilman Starr was addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| That is, some of us have argued in favor of a defined contribution plan because you throw money in the pot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| but then you don't have a residual shortfall risk to face in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| And we've wrestled with that, and I understand that there's been a legitimate and fair and honest disagreement about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| But I think there's something that Mr. Starr mentioned that maybe we should think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| and it dovetails with what Daniel was raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| And that is, I don't know if you looked at the ballot in the last primary election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| but there were some things on there that caused your eyes to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| And as a voter, you sometimes wonder, what the heck are they saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| And that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| These are hard subjects for someone who's going to spend ten minutes on the problem and not ten weeks on the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3073)|
| 0:51:22| I don't know why, if the state statute says that when asking a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| you must state the text of the question and then provide, on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| a provision for the voter to vote yes or no, a kind of a clear statement of what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| and then they get to say yes or no, and it can't be certainly more complicated than yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| They can't write an essay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I don't know why this particular question could not, in the interim couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| be rephrased as a two-part question so that ask the voters if they want to close the existing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| and replace it with something else and not say what, and then ask a separate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| Do you want to replace it with this hybrid defined benefit slash defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| so that you would have the answer to one of the two questions that Marshall was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| What is the meaning of their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Give them a clear two-stepper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| I would add to that, and probably won't have very many folks agree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| that I would ask a follow-up question, and if they didn't like A, would you prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| or would you like to replace it with a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| And the reason I say that is we are, by charter and by law, putting this back in the lap of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3155)|
| 0:52:43| but I'm sympathetic to what Marshall said, and that is that how much of a choice are they really getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3163)|
| 0:52:51| We can't give them, write an essay about what you'd really like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| That won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| But in a yes or no world, we could ask them if they want to close it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| if they want a defined benefit slash contribution plan, if they want a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| or I suppose none of the above if you remember your old high school exams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| but that really takes us nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| So I wonder if we clearly state a question and give the yes or no opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| whether we haven't fulfilled the obligation we have under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| and by the same token, if we were to give a more meaningful choice or choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| whether it's two questions or three, whether we aren't doing the voters a favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| and then let the newspapers and the TV media and whoever else wants to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| argue the pro and cons because the voters are the ones that make the choice and pay the bill as taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| and there's something to be said for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| All right, let me stop that whole line of discussion and say I still think this thing as is is better than what we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| and so I'm not trying to derail that, but I would like to see actually a better choice for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| And I don't know of a legal reason that's absolute why we can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| I will tell you that I have asked for a ruling from the Department of Elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| but they are very busy this time of year, so I don't have anything to report to you about what they say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| But if there's a way to give the voters a meaningful choice, I would rather we do that as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Okay, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Oh, I'm sorry, Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Are you talking to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Are you talking to the overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| I thought we were done with talking to the amendment, but maybe we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| I want to talk to the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| I was talking to the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Let's deal with this amendment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| As to the amendment, I'm supporting the idea that we leave the language in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3285)|
| 0:54:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| The motion is to delete that amendatory language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| So no means don't delete it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| The motion is to delete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| So if you agree to delete the language, then you vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| You vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| There's a light on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Did you still want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Yeah, we had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Let's do a roll call just to be sure on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| The chair will vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3353)|
| 0:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| So we have two amendments that have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| We're back now to the original ordinance, original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| I want to speak to the overall ordinance that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| and I will not be supporting this as I have all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| And for two reasons, and I just want to go on record for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| is that, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| I don't really feel that we're giving the taxpayers a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| and I don't think this is in the best interest of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| And I'm felt this way, and, again, as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| with all due respect to you, Mayor, and my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| that I won't be supporting this for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| I really think that what we're looking at is that we have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| where I really feel very strongly that we need to end the existing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| but I really feel that the plan that we have on the table is not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| best interest of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| I've often said that good people can disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| We've got that case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Since I guess I spoke out of turn in the sense I thought we were done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| with the motion to delete that, but I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| Since you've already spoken on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I was going to say I would sort of leapfrog from what Dwayne said to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| suggest a motion that we break it out and have two questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| or three questions to the voters so they can decide to close the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| get a hybrid, get a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| In other words, set three plans with clear yeses or nos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| and count the votes that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| The motion is that we break the question portion of this out for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| taxpayer voters to say, one, we're proposing to close the existing plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| effective January 1, and then secondly, we're proposing to substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| yes or no is the first one, we're proposing to substitute a defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| benefit, defined contribution or hybrid plan, question number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| and then alternatively we're proposing a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| and let them, again, yes or no, and let the voters choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| And we could have a sentence or an italic or bold statement that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| only pick one of those final two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| The law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| There is no defined contribution plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| It's the same one we've been talking about all along, which is the 8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| and the 10% contribution, and it goes from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| All the other rules stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| If you're going to introduce a new plan, it has to, under 1355 of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| it has to go to the pension board, be considered for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| and come back to you for comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| You can't just create a new plan right now and put it before the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| without following the procedures that were followed on the plan that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| currently before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| All right, and are you saying that they could not waive 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| and do it in a shorter period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| They meet around August the 12th or 15th or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| I don't know if they could or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| I would, frankly, be shocked if you could create that plan in that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| The plan is no different than we've been talking about for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| Well, have you got it in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Put 8% for the general government workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Have you prepared it in writing to submit to us as an amendment to this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| We have lawyers that we can have them draft it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Okay, I'm going to call on Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| Well, I mean, I really wasn't going to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| I mean, we've spent an enormous amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And, you know, I'm going to say that it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| The administration has done a great job with the city employee groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| meeting and finding huge, huge savings, potential savings for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| I mean, there's been great concessions that have been given without totally doing away with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| which I think would be totally irresponsible to go from the defined benefits to defined contribution in one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| I think it's the wrong move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| The majority of council, after various, many workshops, hours of discussion, hours of debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| hours of reading and studying and becoming, you know, pretty knowledgeable about pension plans, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| I think we made a good, solid financial decision for the future of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| I may be wrong, but I think all three of the ones who have opposed it said it's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| It's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| It's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| What's wrong with it not being better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I mean, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| We're making strides forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| You know, to me, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| If we break the question out and if they vote the old one out and won't support the new one, what do we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| We got two more years of people that remain in the plan that we've all agreed on that is not sustainable for the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3665)|
| 1:01:14| So, you know, I just think that we've beat this horse to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| I think it's time for us to move on, take it to the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| let them decide that the voters are smart enough to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| And so I just commend the work that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| I think we're going down the right path and we're doing it with good reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| and we're doing it deliberately and not making huge strides and making huge changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| And government works slow, and there's a reason at times that it does work slow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| you have to be careful because you can make huge mistakes if you go what I feel is a drastic measure from one end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| And that's where the folks that don't support this are wanting to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| So, you know, I'm going to support it and I urge, you know, my other council members to support it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| Thank you, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| I'm a little bit concerned about this late idea that we're going to put three questions before the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| One question is to close the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| So let's say they vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| The second question is to substitute the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| They vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| The third one is to have a defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| They vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| So we're going in that circle with no clear direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| We have a question whether it's the best question, whether it is the correct question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| It is the result of many months of study and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| So I'm going to be supporting moving forward with this and let the voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| I did audition the wording of this to some folks because I have been concerned for some time that typically on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| the wording is very confusing and people, they just tune out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| So I have auditioned this with some folks, and they did understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| and they did not have a problem with the wording that is in our agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| So I will be supporting this and would encourage my colleagues to do likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3794)|
| 1:03:25| Councilman Dalibofi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Well, I was going to say that I appreciate what Councilman Pavlis and Councilwoman Palmer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| but they didn't address the alternate version of this, which is that we have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| One, do we close it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| And two, do you want a defined benefit slash contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| Because they might want to close it but not have this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| and we'll know then in two years we've got to put something else in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| And as Marshall pointed out, the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| you won't know whether they said no to close or no to the new option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| And so I think that choice is a very logical one, and it can't be really inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| You'll know their real desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| And secondly, you talked about working months and months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| Tonight we took out language that's been in there for quite some time and that we approved back in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| We took out two paragraphs that add flexibility to the plan because it was objected to by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| So some things are happening rather quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| and it's up to us as the legislators to try to decide what's a good way to bring the question to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| And we don't want to confuse them, and we want to know what they say and what they mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| and I don't see any harm in breaking it in two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Make a motion to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| I have a pending motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Right, there's still and there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Right, and I'm going to modify that to accommodate the council's statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| that it be a simple thing to break it into two questions, close, defined benefit, defined contribution, hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Could you say that one more time so I can understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| There would be two separate questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| One, do you want to close the existing plan C and G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Yes or no, voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| And then do you want to substitute a defined benefit, defined contribution, hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| the language we just talked about earlier when we voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| And so we would have a very distinct response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Have you considered, and I just want to ask this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| have you considered the possibility that they say, yes, we want to close the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| no, we don't want to open another plan, then you're left with no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| Then you've got to put a plan on in two years, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| But you know they want to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| During those two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| There's no plan for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| No plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| Couldn't we just expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| We could expand the 457 plan or I think there would be other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| I'll go back to what you said, Nick, in that we're the legislatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| That's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| We're here to make these decisions based on the information we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| And you said that voters take ten minutes, well, we took ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| And that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| And that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| That's what we've studied it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| That's what we've battered it back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| And it's a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| But that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| The voters can't possibly have the in-depth of discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| and the in-depth of the reading and studying it like we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| And that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| And we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| It's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| There's been amendments that none of us or not everybody agrees on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| But you've got to pick the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| It does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| And they're vested ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| We go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| You've got ten years to fix it if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| But we're the legislatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| We're here to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| And that's the question in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| And I'm here to support that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Mr. Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| First, I'll say I have not discussed this at all with Councilman Della Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| But based on some comments at one of our many pension workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| probably some two or three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| I researched the issue about the possibility of dividing the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| And though I don't have the specific citation of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| I believe it's in Title V of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| where I personally have my doubts that you can take a question that becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4035)|
| 1:07:24| or leads to a possible either-or conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| I certainly understand Councilman Della Vope wanting to give the voters a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| But my reading of that specific part of TCA Title V gave me a doubt that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4055)|
| 1:07:43| if you reach the situation where the voters want to close the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| and then the second scenario is they don't approve a new plan that there's nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4068)|
| 1:07:57| I'm fairly certain that that would have some issues with the election board over in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| So we have an amendment on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| And the amendment is to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| Mr. Mitchell, do you have the wording on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| Mr. Della Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| The amendment was to take the question that appears on page 641| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| and with Council's aid between now and the next meeting to have it divided into two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| So it asks the voters, do you want to close the plan C and G, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| And then a secondly numbered question that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| do you want to substitute for new workers a defined benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| defined contribution hybrid plan as we've defined it in this big document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| And you have a second for that, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| So any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| If you support that, you will vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| If you do not, you will say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| We'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Yeah, we'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4142)|

| 1:09:19| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| That amendment fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| So we are now back to the original motion to pass ordinance, the number 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| this ordinance as amended with the first and second amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| And we have a motion and second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4176)|

| 1:09:42| and the changing of the description in the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Changing the description and taking out the language, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4187)|

| 1:14:51| Hello, Danny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Danny Harp, 8725 Inlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| And we've been working with Ms. Sue Mowers with the Crestwood Hills Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| And Sue gave me a call yesterday and the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| We discussed some concerns that the neighborhood has concerning lighting and signage at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| And I think we have addressed those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| We have talked with the tenant, our potential tenant, before this about the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| And they are in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| What Ms. Mower in the neighborhood was concerned about was the lighting in the parking lot spilling over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4527)|
| 1:15:35| glaring into the neighborhood, and about the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| And we have received the sign proposals from the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| And it just includes a monument sign that is there right now, a similar sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| and then signage on the interstate sign of the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Her concern was that they might put a large pedestal sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| They have no intention of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| And their lighting is going to be minimal, but just to offer security for the parking area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4565)|
| 1:16:14| So I think we have addressed those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| And it's been good working with the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| But we are not in agreement with any conditions, of course, to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| I also want to say that both Mr. Harp and Ms. Mower have been working for the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| And I think we've had a number of telephone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Right, Danny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Back and forth on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| And he has expressed what the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| And I think each one of the council members received a letter that Sue had sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| She was unable to be here this evening because of the West Knox Homeowners Association meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| which she's one of the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| But the concerns were, and Danny has addressed those, had to do with the lighting in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| I know that we talked about having security lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| We also talked about that the signage would only be on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| And there would be a monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| I think that the 01 requirements are a six-foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| And the other big issue was that there would not be a pole sign located with the property on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| Is that correct, Danny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| And the other concern is, and I think that as soon as the potential tenant has his drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| and this sort of thing together, that you're going to meet with Sue in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| to show them exactly what is going to happen there with the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| We've already gone over it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| And we have actually a meeting at our place that was very well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| So we went over a lot of that, the preliminary things and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| And we do have final say-so as well in regards to a lot of things concerning the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| But this is a really good example of where their project, which is actually in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| and the neighborhood is actually in the county, but the two of them have been working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| and that we've been working together with them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| And so, Danny, you're to be commended for that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| It hasn't been easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| They've been mostly a pleasure to work with, but I know they have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| I hear that word mostly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| And they probably said the same about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| I've been in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| It was great on both parts, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| They are excited about it, actually, as she told me yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Well, they're really pleased that the building is going to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| and it's going to go on the tax records, and that's what's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| And, Mayor, I will say I've been in the middle, so I know what's been said both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| But, anyway, this is going to be a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| We're looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| And it will be good to have it on the taxes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4722)|

| 1:18:44| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| I just wanted to thank Denny as well because we have seen projects where developers don't talk to homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| and it ends up being very, very contentious by the time you get to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| And the reality is you always learn something when you talk to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| and there's always a way to work together if you can just roll up your sleeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4746)|

| 1:19:18| So we had contacted her about a year ago after we got it, way before any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| So she's been good to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120807?start=4764)|
