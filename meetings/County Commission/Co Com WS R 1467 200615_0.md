| 0:01:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Commissioner Jay, with the absence of Commissioner Biggs, would you please lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| If you are able, please stand and salute our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=96)|
| 0:01:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Very briefly, for those of you who may be tuning in for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| Knox County Commission always has two regularly scheduled meetings each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Usually a work session is on the third Monday of the month, followed by the general commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| which is on the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| So tonight's the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| This is our first pass through the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Some things will be voted on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Some things will be put on what's called our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| And then at next week's meeting, which will be a little more formal, that's when, for lack of a better description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| all the votes actually count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| So tonight is sort of that first work to organize and take that first pass through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| So by our rules, we also have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| And we will open tonight's meeting with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| I have several guests that have expressed an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| But right off the top, I know I'd like to recognize Mayor Jacobs, who's got a few things to share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| So thank you, Mayor Jacobs, for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| I just wanted to take a moment to recognize our tremendous information technology department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| IT is one of the departments that we only think about when things don't work like they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=170)|
| 0:02:58| When things do go smoothly, which is almost all the time, we take it for granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| and forget that there's a great team of top-notch professionals behind the scenes making it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| In fact, doing their job well means no one notices them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| They are truly unsung heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| Sometimes I think they're superheroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| For instance, as you all know, the city of Knoxville was hit by a ransomware attack last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| The county's IT department immediately sprang into action, securing our own network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| At one point, Zach Webb, the county's chief technology officer, sent me a text that he and his crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| were working at one of the county's off-site locations, securing a link between that location and our servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| For security purposes, I can't tell you exactly what they were doing, but it was impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| I text back, dude, are you like Batman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Over the past 21 months, the IT department has undergone a major internal reorganization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| updated jobs to industry standards, implemented a cloud-based asset management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| and ticketing system to increase accountability, completely overhauled our entire cybersecurity framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| modernized our workstation system-wide, moved to a modern hybrid cloud environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| including secure remote connectivity and modern VPN utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| which was what allowed for the rapid deployment of an off-site workforce during the COVID-19 crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| facilitated the use of remote meeting tools like Zoom and Teams to allow county business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| to continue uninterrupted throughout COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| created secure Wi-Fi networks at the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| expanded the public Wi-Fi networks at our senior centers to provide free public Wi-Fi in the parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=283)|
| 0:04:50| added Wi-Fi to the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| We were told this project would cost upwards of $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| IT did it for about $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| They created the following websites, knoxgov.net, which is our employee intranet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| and all4knox.com, and redesigned knoxcounty.org, including the covid.knoxcounty.org page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| Governor Haslam recently told me that he thought our COVID-19 website was the best one in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| In addition to our health department, the credit for that belongs to people like Chris McCoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| who worked countless hours to keep the website current and accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Again, all of this has been accomplished in 21 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| So the next time you log on to your county workstation, visit one of our websites, or check your county email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| please remember the reason it all works so well and so seamlessly is because we have, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| the best IT department in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| Can we do a standing round of applause for Jack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=359)|
| 0:06:11| Jack, I've got to tell you, it's really accurate what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| I mean, you've got the best MySpace page of anybody I've ever seen, and so we appreciate that so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=375)|
| 0:06:26| I was just kidding in case you all thought that was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| We have several other citizens who have also signed up for public forum, and I am going to call their names in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=392)|
| 0:06:40| And the way our public forum works, we always will grant each visitor up to five minutes to speak on a particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| If we have folks who have a very lengthy set or a long list of folks that want to speak on one issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| we usually ask to have a spokesperson appointed and then keep that total to about 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| But I've got four people who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| The first one is Laura Squires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| And, Laura, when you get to the podium, if you could just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| Sure, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| And with permission, may I remove masks while I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Because I will be no closer than six feet to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| Laura Squires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| S-Q-U-I-R-E-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| All right, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Just name and address for the record, Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| My name is Laura Squires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| I live in Farragut currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| I have been living in Knox County off and on since the year 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| I have owned a home in Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| I have owned five homes in Knox County, and I currently own a home in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| I'm also a very poor public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| I'm here to ask for Knox County Commission's assistance in an issue that you are probably slightly familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| You probably saw this in a PowerPoint projection a couple of years ago, and you thought, oh, that's never going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| It has, and this is related to the deployment of 5G cellular antenna in neighborhoods in Knoxville, Knox County, and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=493)|
| 0:08:23| It sounds futuristic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| In front of you, you have a document that I copied from the submission Verizon or their applicant provided to the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=505)|

| 0:08:43| The situation we face is that due to House Bill 2279, which is on page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| we have essentially lost our ability as Tennesseans to defend ourselves against being overrun by 5G cellular antenna in our residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=532)|
| 0:09:02| This bill was passed in May of 2018 without the knowledge or consent of most Tennesseans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| and certainly with no benefits to any Tennessee property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=547)|

| 0:09:13| When you go home tonight, please realize that this can happen in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| and you are powerless to defend yourself against it as long as it goes in a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| What's difficult to imagine is this is one cellular carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| They can all do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| They can put as many as they want wherever they want in the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| I come tonight to plea for your help to join alongside Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| If you look at page three of my document, page 16 of HB 2279,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| this law, when passed, remains under review and comes back to the Tennessee General Assembly January of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| It is still being evaluated by a committee called the Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, or TASR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| Bullet point one being evaluated is the impact on deployment of broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Well, I and my neighbors are being impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| If you would please turn the page, Town of Farragut worked to develop a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| and has sent this resolution as Town of Farragut's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| We need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Town of Farragut cannot fight this alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| We just unfortunately are in part of the first residential deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| I dare say that if this continues through Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| you will have residents just like me from Whittington Creek and Mallard Bay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| and maybe even Cherokee Boulevard standing before you and asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| I am here so that you can't say you didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| It can be any number of towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| The density right now mostly proposed is one tower per eight to ten homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| Imagine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Imagine how many homes are on your street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| One tower every eight to ten homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| According to Verizon, I apologize, I shouldn't quote it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| some industry representatives say that a tower has to be in a direct line of sight to receive service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Everybody's house is going to be able to see one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Sometimes they propose co-locating, putting, for example, an AT&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| and a Verizon transmitter on the same tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| To this I am also opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Why should any one property take a hit like that on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| to save someone else from having a pole in their yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| Again, I came tonight so that you can't say you didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| This will affect my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| It's already been wired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| The picture on the front page is the street immediately behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| I'm here to ask for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| There are four items on the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Number one, and I don't know if this is appropriate per protocol, but if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| I would like for you to discuss 5G residential areas in tonight's work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| and appoint a commissioner to coordinate writing a resolution to oppose any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| much less the unbridled, residential deployment in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Number two, to vote and pass a resolution at the next County Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| on June 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Number three, jointly with Farragut to go to Governor Bill Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| to halt any additional residential deployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| until TASA reports back to the General Assembly in January of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| And number four, and most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| for Knox County Commission to have a joint meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| with all state representatives and state senators representing Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| to draft a new legislation for introduction in January of 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| to protect neighborhoods, property owners, and Tennessee citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| from the invasion of an unknown number of towers, antenna, and poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| in Knox County residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| In closing, this is urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| It cannot wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| And please start tonight your actions to protect Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Next is Marla Stairwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Commissioner Daly's got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| I've been keeping up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| I've been keeping up with this some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| I know that y'all had a meeting with Representative Zachary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| and maybe Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| How did that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| That's been about four months ago, five months ago, something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| Well, what would be very informative, if you would take your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| and I have communicated directly and spoken directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| both with Senator Briggs and Jason Zachary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| I had an email back from Jason this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| They both worked tirelessly for us throughout the month of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| to try to form a piece of legislation to try to get some boundaries around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| It was presented on March 4th to the Tennessee House Subcommittee on Utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| There were circumstances that may have prevented a good vote that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| because it was right after the tornado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| So Jason Zachary, our state representative, spent some time after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| along with David Smoke, our town administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| with representatives from Verizon and AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| They came to some agreement that was to have worked for us going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| but I don't care if it's a pretty poll or an ugly poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I don't want to poll every eight to ten houses in Farragut, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| or anywhere else I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| So they have worked for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Jason Zachary continues to work with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| They all continue to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| But we're not big enough to stop this alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| and we need your help to get Knox County on board to go to Governor Bill Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| The advantage Farragut has over anyone else so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| and our town attorney said in a BOMA meeting online about three to four weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| that Verizon wasn't used to seeing this type of uproar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Please, I'm not quoting directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| I'm just paraphrasing based on what I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Well, we have the advantage of knowing because to put these towers in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| you had to have come before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| I don't even know what the process is in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I can't figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Today I emailed a gentleman named Jeff Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| He's no longer with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Then I emailed a female, I believe her name is Amy Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I've not yet heard back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| So, yes, there has been work done, but that work was withdrawn and pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| as I understand it, to gain whatever agreement was gained related to aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| We had two years ago, Commissioner Schoonmaker, I believe, we had a big presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| We've seen this coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker, it was coming to Farragut first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| He has served me excellently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| He has sat at the meetings with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| We've seen that this was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Did we not, this might be a question for Ms. Snow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| did we not come up with a guideline or look at engineering to look at a guideline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Everybody needs your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| We did, but we got circumvented by not only the state, but then the Federal Communications Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| So that was my other question is, well, first off, Farragut is the only entity in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| that actually can get approval from its Metropolitan Planning Commission because of the way theirs was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| No other entity, we can't do that here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| But I'm a little confused on your third question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| I didn't think the governor could actually put a halt to 5G going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| because they're now classified by the federal government as public utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Well, what is interesting about the state of Tennessee is not all states have their own internal law regulating 5G deployment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| small cell deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Tennessee is one of the few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| The Tennessee law, according to certain meetings I have attended, is much tighter in places than is the federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| If we were fighting the federal law, we'd be better off than the Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| That is why I'm asking for your help with Bill Lee related to House Bill 2279.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| We have to fight what has been done to us as a Tennessean before we can fight what is done to us under the FCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| But thank you all for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| And it is coming to your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Look down your street tonight and imagine what it will look like with multiple poles in front of your neighbor's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| And the key is when the folks are putting the fiber optics underground in front of your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| that's usually the signal that 5G is coming because that has to be first before the tower goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| If I may speak once more, as you drive home tonight, look across the interstate, look down the highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| You will see small PVC white tubes popping up out of the ground with an orange end cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| As I understand it, that is the 5G fiber optic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| That is what's been laid in front of my house, the street behind me, Sweetbriar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| We need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| These are going to infest us, and they are going to multiply, and we are currently defenseless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| Maybe Bill Lee can't do a whole lot, but maybe he'll listen at least if Knox County and Farragut go hand in hand and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| this is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Thanks, Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| All right, next we've got Marla Stairwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1062)|
| 0:17:57| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| I'm Marla Stairwood at 1224 Snyder School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| I'm in District 6, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| And I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak to you all tonight about 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| I'm going to try to read from my notes as much as possible for the sake of clarity and brevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| There are several issues to discuss about 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| One is the surveillance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| That's very important, especially as we have contact tracing bills to look at and tracking citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| And then there's the property decrease issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| All those are important, but I'm going to focus on the health issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| We're told that 5G is the foundation for reaching the full potential of the Internet of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| and to make it all happen we've got to have these poles, these antennas like Laura just told you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| 5G is not going to replace the current technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| It adds to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| We are talking about a quantum leap in what we've been using and what 5G would bring us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| It will subject us to more of the submillimeter and millimeter waves on top of what we've already been exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1136)|
| 0:19:08| What's not safe about that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Everybody says, I've got it now, I'm not sick, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Well, it's going to be a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| What the FCC and the telecom industry won't tell you are the numerous studies proving harm from wireless radiation exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1155)|
| 0:19:25| There are several from the military in the 70s and 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Sharon Goldberg testified regarding her study at a Michigan 5G small cell tower legislation hearing October 4th, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1168)|
| 0:19:37| explaining why 5G shouldn't be rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| And she told them there are significant connections to blood sugar, diabetes, congestive heart failure, cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1179)|
| 0:19:48| They listened closely to her testimony, asked her to stay over to answer questions, still voted for 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| But her study is particularly compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| A particularly outstanding study released in 2008 by the National Toxicology Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| that's a division of our own National Institute of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| concluded that there's very clear evidence of harm from exposure to radiofrequency radiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| specifically RFRs used for 2G and 3G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Okay, we're using 4G now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| This study took 30 years to complete, found the subjects consistently developed cancerous tumors of the brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| heart, reproductive organs, it goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| 5G supporters love to say of this study, and the FCC and the industry people love to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| yeah, but that study was on rats, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Yeah, most of our medical studies, as a matter of fact, 95% of our medical studies are conducted on rats and mice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| That's acceptable standard procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| So why doesn't the industry, why doesn't the FCC acknowledge this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| Because it shows proof of harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| We could stand here all night and talk about the different studies that show proof of harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences designated power frequency electromagnetic fields possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| human carcinogenics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| In March 2002, the International Association on Research of Cancer and the World Health Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| we're all familiar with the WHO, right, assigned the same designation to their monographs for the evaluation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| carcinogenic risks to humans after proof of harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Firefighters in California in 2015 all became ill because they had a 2G tower near their station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1286)|
| 0:21:34| They all did brain scans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| They were all the same, and that is proof of harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| They have a resolution now keeping all of the towers away from fire stations in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| So that was 2G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| If we're talking proof of harm for the last 30 years on previous generations, what makes us feel 5G is going to be safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1315)|
| 0:22:05| And not everyone agrees with this, or the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Scientists from over 40 countries wrote the 5G appeal, and you can find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| As a matter of fact, I will send all of you links to all of this information if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| But these scientists from over 40 countries signed what they called the 5G appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| asking for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G until potential hazards for human health and the environment have been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| Human health and the environment have been fully investigated by scientists independent from industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| because they know 5G will substantially increase exposure to RF, EMF, on top of what we already use today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| And that's an important phrase, independent of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| The FCC will guide you to its studies that all show 5G safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| That's a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| We can't trust their studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| So you must find studies that are independent of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| Something the FCC and industry folks don't like to linger on, either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| is the fact that the FCC study that they used to prove safety was in 1996, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| That was before 5G even came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Hey, Marla?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Yes, but I mean it sounds like you're going to be able to e-mail us all those notes and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I mean, you can go another minute, out of fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| But I know we've got a couple other speakers that do want to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| What I'd like to instill today is a plea that as you research these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| as you see applications from telecom or industry participants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| as you wonder is it safe for my child or my grandchild to sleep 30 feet from one of these poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| please invoke precautionary principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| Citizens of Knox County, Knoxville, Farragut need your intense focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| your critical thinking skills, and your discernment, especially now, more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| I'm a firm believer that forcing this industry promulgated carcinogenic genotoxin upon the public is criminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1441)|
| 0:24:09| and we do not consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Chris, I'm going to make sure I've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Chris with KZANI or Z-A-N-O-N-I, ZANI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1458)|

| 0:24:29| Just if you could state your name and address clearly for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| My name is Chris ZANONI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| I live in 1829 Granada Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| My husband and I have five children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| We live in the Bluegrass School area of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you all for hearing me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| I agree with my neighbor from Farragut regarding as a Knox County citizen living in West County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| that we do not want the cell towers, the small cell towers showing up in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| I've talked to just over the weekend just under 20 people, my neighbors in neighboring communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| None of them were aware that this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Some having underground utilities like Farragut will be very angry, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| to see workers in their front right-of-way trying to install these towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| I think it's growing and it's a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| And I agree with Marla that there are not any, there are no independent safety studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| showing that 5G non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation beginning at 24 gigahertz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| is safe for the residents of Knox County who will be exposed to this radiation 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1539)|
| 0:25:47| Did you know that the telecom companies installing 5G infrastructure cannot get insurance against harm to human health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1547)|
| 0:25:55| Corporate insurers like Lloyd's of London will not insure electromagnetic radiation issues at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| So even if you do not believe any of the scientific studies and peer-reviewed studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| that explain how these EMRs cause biological harm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| wouldn't that give you reason to question its safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| and consider having a halt for it to be investigated further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| before it's allowed in our neighborhoods and in our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| These cell towers will also be out on apartment rooftops and, like I said, schools where children are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| Pregnant women will be exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| People with health conditions, immunocompromised people will be exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| Can you also tell me what company is testing existing cell towers in Knox County on an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| to make sure they are not presently exceeding FCC safety guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| Does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| No industry regulated at all to show the amount of radiation coming from the existing towers is within FCC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| Out of an abundance of caution through the COVID-19 epidemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| our government has shut down a great percentage of our country's economy, closed schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| people have lost their jobs, small businesses have completely gone out of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| elderly have been secluded in retirement homes, not allowed visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| depression and suicide rates have increased, all out of the abundance of caution for public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| to prevent people from getting sick and dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And I ask, shouldn't out of an abundance of caution the installation of 5G be halted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1662)|
| 0:27:52| We're not anti-technology, but halted to make sure it's safe before it's implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| Dr. Martin Paul, who has studied EMRs for many years and its effects on the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| published his first paper in 2013 on the effects of radiation on calcium channel blockers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| which means how it affects the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| It was cited 219 times in scientific literature as is listed in the Google Scholar database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| You can check that, which means it was widely recognized, and that was even before 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| Per Dr. Paul, exposure to electromagnetic radiation can cause tachycardia, fast heart rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| cardiac arrhythmias, and so I ask, how would you feel if your high school son was playing football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| and had a sudden heart attack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| You could say it was just a fluke, or you might wish you could go back to this meeting today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| and done all you could to help 5G from being installed in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| And I have not even addressed the studies, the strong evidence regarding, as Marla was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| other parts, other body systems, like the reproductive system or the effects on the nervous system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| Please act now in representing the people of Knox County to Governor Lee, joining our neighbors in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| asking that 5G installation be halted until thorough research can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| And I would like to submit a resolution to the commission today for Knox County, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| You're welcome to submit it, and you're right at your time slot here, so go ahead and hand it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I am done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Who would I give this to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| You can hand it to the young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Next is Kathy Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1784)|
| 0:29:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Hi, Kathy, if you could name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| My name is Kathy Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| I live at 716 Woodchase Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| I'd like to talk to you a little bit today about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| I usually don't come to these kind of meetings because most of you guys at the commission level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| and what you're doing is going like it's very smooth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1819)|
| 0:30:28| Everything's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| The budget's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| You know, everything goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| But every now and then, we come across something that we get passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| So I want to not come across very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| I support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you very much for all your service and what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| We wouldn't be who we are today without the generosity of your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| So I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| I want to describe, first of all, my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| I'm a radio chemist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| That's a chemist who studies things that are radioactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| And in conjunction with that, we look at a lot of things about the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| So we take somebody that's familiar with this and we look at the health physics of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1868)|
| 0:31:17| So that's my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| So when I heard about, and I'm a trainer and I make instruments that measure radiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| so I'm all about technology, all about the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| But when I heard about that I'm now going to have an exposure at my house, where I sleep, where my family is, where my schools are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1892)|
| 0:31:48| I really got concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| And the reason I got concerned is because in radiation, the way that we protect ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| is we spend less time around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| We are further away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Or we put something between us and the radiation to keep safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| And so I want you to know that even though radio waves and cell towers are less energetic than, say, gammas and x-rays and UV vis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1933)|
| 0:32:26| it's still electromagnetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| And the more we're exposed, the more our body has damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| And that's just pure and simple physics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| And so one of the things that would be really nice is if we could put together some studies, that takes time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| but couldn't we just approach 5G in the business place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Couldn't we just look at 5G as a solution to our business problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| Because when I go to work, I'm given a badge, I'm given a TLD, I'm given a hard hat, I'm given steel-toed shoes, I'm given safety glasses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1978)|
| 0:33:08| lab coat, everything I need to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| So when I go in the workplace, I accept the hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| I accept the hazards that I go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| And so the thing that really concerns me is that now we have people in their homes that are not scientists like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=1997)|
| 0:33:28| They are going about their business, they might be accountants, they might be teachers, they might serve food at a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2008)|
| 0:33:38| they could be a car mechanic, but they're not health physicists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| And so they're using the internet, and they're going about their daily business, and this is a silent threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2022)|
| 0:33:51| This has, it might burn your skin, you know, it might, it might take five to ten years to develop cancer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| it might take two if the cell tower is right outside your bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| So these kinds of things, we don't know how quickly that they'll, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| these kinds of things, we don't know how quickly that they'll branch out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| but I just really feel like we should separate our work risk from our family risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| And I don't know why the 5G has to be in our neighborhoods first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| So I want to conclude this with, why don't we try keeping it in the workplace for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| where professionals can measure the dose we're receiving and make sure we're safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| And if we can do it on the business level, then we can apply it to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| So that's my appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| And I'm hoping that maybe we can come up with some hybrid way to apply all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| And I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Next on our agenda is Sheriff Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| So, Sheriff Spangler, thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2103)|
| 0:35:15| Good evening, Commission. Tom Spangler, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| I want to address you and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| And actually, I'll probably read a few of my notes just so that I don't miss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| So I want to make sure that you understand where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Commission and citizens of Knox County, I felt it appropriate and timely to address you both on a few things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| given the attention of law enforcement officers across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| The first thing I want to say is I'm honored to be the Sheriff of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| And it's with pride and honor that I tell each of you, and I truly believe in my heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| that we have some of the finest law enforcement officers in the country, right here in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| They wake each morning or begin their evening and or night shift placing their badge over their heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2157)|
| 0:36:06| That badge represents far more than the authority to enforce laws of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| That badge represents an oath that they have taken along with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| to protect and serve our great community of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| I absolutely believe we do it without hesitation or discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| Let me say and let me be very clear when I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Mr. Floyd did not deserve to die. Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| I also believe that the overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers all over this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| but most certainly here in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| decided to become law enforcement officers for the same reason that I did 30 plus years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| It definitely was not for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| It definitely was not for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| It wasn't for the working conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| It was simply to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| To be a difference maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| And to help people in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| I have felt no need, and I have been asked this many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| I felt no need to make any changes to how we do things in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| within our Knox County Sheriff's Office, in regard to enforcing the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Let me be clear that this is not talking about our training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Because I will put our training up against anybody in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| We do not train some of those things that they are asking us to do, to do away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| We do not teach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| We will not teach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Those men and women go through a deacceleration training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| Our officers go through training with our corrections when they first start out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| They go through a five-week training academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| We teach the CIT, the critical incident training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| that our officers get within corrections, and they get it when they are on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| I want to make sure that we understand that our men and women are out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| doing the best that we have to offer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| And I am very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| The reason is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| The men and women of this agency know what is expected of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| They know what I expect, and they also know that any behavior out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| for this agency will not be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I think with recent events, that has been proven, that I have had to deal with employee issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| Furthermore, I want to be clear that neither I or the men and women should be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| when we are answering a call from 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| We are not concerned about your color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| We are not concerned about your ethnic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Your religion, your sexual preference, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| We simply answer the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| We show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| I also must say I will not dilute or water down crime or criminals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| nor will I ignore the negative effects of the victim or victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| that are a result of criminal committing crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Those are usually lasting effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Some of those effects, whether you are a mother whose child has been murdered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| a small business owner who has lost everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| do not have the insurance to cover that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| a teenager who has been repeatedly raped by a close friend or family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| You see, no matter what the crime, there is always a victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| And we must do our part to never forget them and their struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| I want to reiterate something that I have said to the media many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| If one of my people does something that is out of line, out of character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| and most certainly against the law, they will be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| But let me also say I will also defend any of my deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| who are simply doing their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I do not want them to be afraid of doing their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| which is protecting and serving this great community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| for fear of retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| For fear of retaliation from myself and this administration or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| Lastly, I will close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| We have some amazing people in and around Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| who have gone above and beyond to let myself, Chief Deputy Lyon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| and most importantly the men and women of the street in our corrections facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| know that they are loved and cared for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| and that they appreciate the job they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| We as a country, as a community, must continue to better ourselves daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| Improvement in any area of life begins within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| It starts with each of us evaluating ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| and seeing what areas we need to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| and working with intention on those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| It's an honor to be the Sheriff of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| and the selfless men and women of Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| I want to end it with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| I carry around my oath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| and I'm just going to quote just a couple of lines from that oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| It says that I will discharge and perform with fidelity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| and without prejudice, partiality, or favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| which is what I will continue to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| and those men and women of this Sheriff's Office will continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you. God bless this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| God bless the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| and God bless our country. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2489)|
| 0:41:42| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| Okay, that concludes the public forum component of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| We do have another public forum on the agenda scheduled for the close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| We always do that in all of our work sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Well, we've got to set our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I'm sorry. Yeah, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I just wanted to take a moment to address the 5G situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| and let the people know that we did look into this years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| and did see this coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| I think our engineering department met several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| with representatives of the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and I think, Mr. Law Director, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| we really are pretty much powerless in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| other than passing a resolution to pass on to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| You can provide your support to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| The FCC, utility law, and the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| are in charge of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| We can only express our desires and our beliefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| to throw support to what the will of the people should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and the state should represent the will of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| but so should the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Yes, we did look at these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| and we, as a body, had great concerns about it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| So we will do what we can to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| And what we'll do, we're almost at the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| where we can transition straight in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I've got to get the agenda set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| and I'm going to add that as a follow-up item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| to our agenda tonight just to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| and to establish a committee to follow up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| And I hate to use the cliché in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| of establishing a committee, not one for this to go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| but to get some work done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| To be fair to the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| I don't know that we're going to turn something around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| real quickly in six days or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| but I do know that we will be meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| with the Knox County delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| We do that every year to prepare them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| for the upcoming legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| And I'd rather get a tight committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| to look at this, what we can do, what we can pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| that might help in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| So, with that said, I want to get our agenda set tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| and add that as one of the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| So, looking down, yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| If I'm correct, Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| is chairing the Cable TV Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| which a meeting is coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| July 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| July 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And I think that committee deals a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| about telecom in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| than just cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Perhaps that might be a good forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| to have that group look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Well, that's a set forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Who all is, I don't frankly know off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| is everybody on that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Are we all members by default of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| So, we can handle that as a body and whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Commissioner Beeler, if you're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| We can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I know the meeting is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| While we're taking notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| here's the items that we're going to add tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| that came in after the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Item 33 and 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| You saw on the agenda online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| and in the forum about Item 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| I've spoken to the sponsor of Item 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| That item is actually not going to be added tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| So, you saw it in print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| so it hasn't been added yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| so I can't really call it a withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| but we will not be adding Item 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| So, Item 33 and 45 will be additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| Item 30 and 41 are withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| The non-consent agenda is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Item 6, 8, 9, 13, 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2725)|
| 0:45:34| excuse me, 33, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2734)|
| 0:45:46| 52, 53, and 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| We've just decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| we will add a brief discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| to follow up on the 5G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| which will likely result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| putting some of that on our Cable Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| So, I'd like to add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| Regarding the way we move through our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| I'm going to add immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| or I'm going to move the agenda around a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| Vivian is here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| although I haven't seen her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| I think she's here tonight to talk about the census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| and I know we had the census item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Unfortunately, she can't make it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| so let's move that to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Okay, we'll move that to next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| I hadn't seen her, so I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| All right, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| So, we will move that to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| So, I want to add an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| There's been some discussion on the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| about our schedule of all our votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| It's a really busy six weeks or so, four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| when you look at everything we've got for charter review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| where we've got our budget vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| we've got the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| We've got a lot coming up over the next two weeks or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| So, I do want to add towards the top of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| a discussion item before we move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| just on reviewing our schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| for all of our upcoming meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| over the next couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| because some of those meetings could impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| what's actually on our agenda for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| So, that's what I'm going to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| I had sent you a message on the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| about taking 31 off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Okay, 31 is off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| Mr. Clerk, have you got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| I think when we set the budget vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| I think we were waiting until the last possible minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| to get numbers from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| And we set a meeting for the 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| so we added the fifth week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I would like to have the board entertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| moving that to either the 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| or possibly after the finance meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| to get it within that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| And part of it, I have unscheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| At the time, I didn't know we had a travel schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Now, we do have a travel schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| And I'd like to be here to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| there's a few things that I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| to discuss on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| And also, I think the numbers are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| And in that final finance meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| we could knock that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| if we don't knock it down in the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| I think we're on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| because I just said I wanted to have a move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| after setting the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| to have a quick discussion about our calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Well, before we set the agenda, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| if we want to have it on the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| so there's two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| We can say we can vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| at the finance meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| and set the agenda for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Or we can put it on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| just in case we come to the 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| and want to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Because if we don't add it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| you can't vote it on in the 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| if you choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| If you don't add it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| I think we could change the special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| if there's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I don't know if there's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| to change the special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| for that 22nd or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| But if we don't add it to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| next week, then tonight's the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Right now is the time to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| if you're going to adjust the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| It would have to be a two-thirds vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| to get it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| You don't have to vote on it next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| but it's on there in case you choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| I'll look to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| just for some guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| It sounds like everything he said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| So we could add it on to vote on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| But we'd have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| We could vote on it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Or if we choose to add it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| to the post-finance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| or keep the other date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| that could give us some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Number one, you'll have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| a two-thirds vote to add it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| Number two, if you do add it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| and you schedule it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| then the public will make arrangements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| You either vote or you don't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| I'm just letting you know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| And if you leave the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| the public may be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| which one's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| So the whole point of public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| is to be with specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| what it is you're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| so the public can determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| whether they want to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| and then that we give them enough lead time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| that they can make arrangements to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| That would comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| So if you're going to do it on the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| we're at the window is what the Commissioner is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| And to debate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| and to vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| you'd have to add it to the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Or we could move it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| we're already here for the finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| It may be easier to have the special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| on the 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| because you already got the finance meeting that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Vote on it that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| and then you've had three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| You've got the public forum after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| You've got next week's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| and then you've got finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| for people to come and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| So there's three opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| after tonight to talk about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| That kind of makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| I'm going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| I recognize we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Gill's lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| But first I'm going to call on Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| simply because he's the chair of the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| I think that would be a better transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| to have finance first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| We'll have more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| from the Finance Department of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I don't think the meeting is going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| the full hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| We did schedule it at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| And then we could just vote on the budget after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Would it be possible to back the finance meeting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| just a little bit to make it a little earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| The problem was the room here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| that they were getting it finished at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| They say it takes 45 minutes or an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| to clean this room or disinfect this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| whatever they do to it, from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| And then that's why we were going to meet at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| But, I mean, we could move it to 4.15, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| Chris, do you have a comment about the finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Sort of, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| We've got a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| on the 24th already at 3.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| to vote on the UT sublease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| And so that's going to be on the 24th at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| So you may look at combining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| If you don't want to have two special call meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| you may roll that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Those documents are going out tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| They're very simple and already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| what we've already talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| is just a sublease with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| And so that's scheduled currently at 3.30 on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| Is that right, Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Now, Chris, you told me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| one of the reasons why you wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| a special call meeting was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| so that nobody would be surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| by getting the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Because they just came together today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| So is that something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| if we wanted to keep it more simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| just add that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| we could add that tonight to our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| to vote on that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| And you'd get everybody the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| or the documents tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| to have six days to review them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| before next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Would that be an option as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| so we don't have to do another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Well, you would be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| if you wanted to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| to the agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| And then you only have the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| resolutions to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| on the 24th for the special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| So I'm okay with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| I just, when you were talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| there's already one other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| that's already called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| And so if you all would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| you could add the UT sublease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| to the agenda today for next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| and get those documents out in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Like I said, they're more short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| because ultimately it's a sublease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| from us to UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| which will come out tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Frankly, I'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| That's just speaking my own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| But I want to hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| some of the other commissioners briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| So Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| I appreciate the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| for people to be present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| but there are lots of things that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| We talked about the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Now we're combining meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| But I think in the combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| of combining these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| and special call meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| we have forgotten that the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| needs to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| I mean, we are actively now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| in the process of trying to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| several meetings and conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| without the input of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| and to allow people to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| at the information financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| to make the best possible decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I think we need to probably make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| as we make decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| we have the public present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Yes, looking at the dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I would suggest that we add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| the TVA sublease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| to the agenda for the 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| and then have the budget vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| which it is a budget vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| There is no public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| at the budget vote, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| That we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| at 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| before the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| Do we know if the room is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| at 4 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| We have it at 3.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| for our special call meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| that would be available at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Or 3.30 or 4, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Well, I just want to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| I want to look at Drusill a little bit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| what time do they get out of here with court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| 3.30, so that would give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| about 45 minutes to clean the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Yeah, 30 to 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| That's the reason why we said 4.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| instead of 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| is PBA said they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| clean the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| because they're in there before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I'm sorry, Drusill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Sonny and PBA said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| it takes 30 to 45 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| to clean the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| 4.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| So, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| could you say that in your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Do you want to just schedule it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| 4.15 for the budget vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| and then finance immediately following?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| That would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| But I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| we get over to this side of the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| because, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| we've got Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| and then Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| I would just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| I support what Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| just suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| I would actually suggest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| I think you could add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| the UT thing for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I think that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| a sufficient amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| But I do think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| to give people time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| to come and address the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| and be part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| They've had two weeks to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| but we have set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| a certain amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| for people to engage in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| So, having another public opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| next Monday is certainly appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| I think I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| having the budget vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| after the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| We're waiting on more and more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| that's being updated on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| and the Finance Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| is sort of our last chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| to look at state information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| sales tax information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| everything that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| from the trustees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| and every department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| I'd like to have that knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| before I decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3434)|

| 0:58:05| that can come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| of the Finance Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3486)|

| 0:58:12| I think tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| I think next Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| was number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| And I think adding a third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| there's no reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| that we couldn't add a third one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| to give people an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| to talk to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| right before we do our vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| and weigh in their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| If nobody shows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| But this budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| has been so condensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| because of the shutdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| and because of the COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| I'd like to err| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3511)|

| 0:58:37| when it comes to spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3524)|

| 0:58:48| to add the UT documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| We're going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| a two-third vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| So I'm going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| that we add the UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| sublease documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3534)|

| 0:58:57| Also, that we add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| the budget proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| to the 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| after finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Between finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| budget vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| starting at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| That's my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| and it will require two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Should we separate those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| I'll make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| to add the UT documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| It will require a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| Sublease document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| The second is from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3571)|

| 0:59:35| which we can then add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| And then the proper motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| would be to pull it from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| and then send it forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| But that's getting ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| of the cart a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| So the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| I was just about to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| we've got to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| So we don't have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| If it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=3595)|

| 1:11:05| The three existing board members who are willing to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| are Terry Henley, Leslie Mertz, and Alvin Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| We have three other individuals who are Shannon Coleman-Egle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| Jan Everidge, and Michael Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| All of them are here and I'd be happy to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| and to at least introduce themselves and tell you a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| about who they are and why they're interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| as well as answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| So I'm happy to answer any questions about the process or what these boards do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| And I recognize Commissioner Daley before we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Todd, are these committee members term limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| or can they serve more than two or three terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| Just trying to figure out how many of they serve these first three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Under state statute, which the state-enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| they are not term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| So any term limits would be anything that you all self-impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| I don't think you've ever taken an official position on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| but I know over the years you've given some different consideration for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| But under state statute, there are no term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Of the three, how long have the three served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| I know that Terry Henley and Leslie Murch have served one term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| And, you know, Alvin, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| There you go, Alvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| How many terms that you've served but three, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| So Alvin's certainly our longest serving member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| and he's been reappointed a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| All right. Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Has any of the existing members have a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| with existing, with the positions they hold in doing business with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| Is there a conflict with the existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| No, they cannot be elected or serve in office of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| to be considered for the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| Or the Housing Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| That's correct, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| And I would say that they have to also be, obviously, residents of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| and be associated with the Board of Trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| which basically affiliated with a membership with the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| as it's currently written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| And when it was put into legislation, it was considered the Board of Trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| So that would be under the statute, the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| All right. Thank you, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| What we'll do is we're going to go ahead and start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| And as I said, I'm going to give each person three to five minutes or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| just to tell you a little bit about yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| If any commissioners have any questions, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| We're not going to be taking a vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| That will take place at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| And in order, I think I'll go ahead and call the first three who have been serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| So this is the order that will go, assuming everybody's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| Terry, then Leslie, then Alvin, then Shannon, then Jan, then Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| So that's the order that will go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| Good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| My name is Terry Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| My address is 1228 Pipe Tower Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| I'm a resident of Knoxville, and I've been here since 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| I'm a local businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| I own an all-state insurance agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| And I'm proud to say that working in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| and I know I don't look like it, but I've been doing it for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| LAUGHTER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| I have learned a lot serving on the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| Lots of things about what goes on in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| And it was very interesting to me to make sure that we serve the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| I think Todd and others could contest the fact that I'm trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| that the whole community gets served by some of my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| and some of the answers that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| But I'm proud of what Todd does and the rest of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| They do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| And I want to serve because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| I can't do what you guys do, but I want to be able to help where I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| And this is one thing that I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| And I want to be able to serve you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| So if you have any questions...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Oh, by the way, I'm a University of Tennessee grad, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| Go Vols. Yes, go Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| And so if you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| And this would be your second term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| This would be the start of the second term, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| All right. I don't think there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| So, all right. Thanks, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Okay. Leslie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4576)|
| 1:16:27| Hey, good evening. My name's Leslie Mertz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| I live at 4416 Beachwood Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| I married, have three kids that are all married and live here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| and starting to gather up a little group of grandkids now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| I am president of Dealers Warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| which is a wholesale distributor of building materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| We cover a little portion of about six states around Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| I've been doing that all my life, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| and have lived in Knoxville for 59 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| All I'd say about this board is I'm not an expert on pilots and TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4636)|
| 1:17:26| but what I have appreciated is being around these developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| that come into Knoxville that don't know Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| or perhaps people that are looking to move their business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| I love meeting them, talking to them, and telling them about my experience here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| and that it's an awesome place to be and it's a great place to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| It's been rewarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| One final comment that's probably none of my business to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| I know somebody asked how many terms Alvin had been on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| I'll just say this about Alvin before he gets up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| He is so incredibly knowledgeable and asks such good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| He's helpful to anybody sitting around that table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| That's the end of my thoughts. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| That's a pretty good introduction, Alvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| I don't know if you could do much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| My name is Alvin Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| I live at 1735 Woodhaven Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| I won't talk about the number of terms that I've served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| on the Industrial Development Board at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| but for that young whippersnapper, Les, who just left here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| when I first came on the board, his dad was on the board, Don Murch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| So I'm with his dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| So I think Les was born at that time, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| I'm almost certain of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| But a little bit about my history and a little bit about my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| is that I spent 20 years working in the banking industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4745)|

| 1:19:20| for Knoxville's Community Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| which is the public housing authority for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| Today I'm serving as CEO of development for LHP Development, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| was formerly known as Lollawood Housing Partnership, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| is in the affordable housing business at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| We have developed over 100 properties to date in 50 cities in 13 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4779)|
| 1:19:47| I've had the experience of working at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| So I've had that experience of working on redevelopment plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| understanding TIFs and pilots in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| Also had the opportunity to be on board of seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| development of the pilot program that we brought in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| for the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| As you heard Todd speak a moment ago, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| beginning to see on the health and ed side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| a lot more applications for pilots to support affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| I bring that affordable housing experience to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| I've got 20 years of affordable housing experience at the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| In addition to that, I served as the Vice Chairman of the Tennessee Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| Development Agency, THDA, who issues all of the low income housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| tax credits for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| I also served on that tax credit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| I think I bring some expertise and some experience to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| that will benefit the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| I think as we continue to see development of affordable housing in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| we're going to see more requests coming before us seeking assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| to make these projects a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| So I hope that that ability and that experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| that I have continue to be served, continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| to be available for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| I've enjoyed serving on the Industrial Development Board and Health and Ed Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| So I can only tell you that if reappointed, I'll be glad to serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4874)|
| 1:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4877)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you, Alvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Next is Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4880)|
| 1:21:30| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| My name is Shannon Coleman-Eagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| No, you didn't read that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| It's Eagle, but there's no A in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| My husband is not local, and I tell them that the Midwesterners can't spell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| So at any rate, it's Shannon Coleman-Eagle, but it's E-G-L-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| I'm a Knox County citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| I'm at 1312 Edinburgh Place, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| I moved to Knoxville in 1996 to attend the University of Tennessee Law School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| And I fell in love with Knoxville, and I didn't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| So I think that's, of course, the story of a lot of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| who come here to attend UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| At any rate, so I have been living here since 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| The first three years I spent in law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| and I've been practicing law for 21 years now here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| I'm currently a partner at Kramer Rayson LLP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| We have offices downtown here, as well as a satellite office in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| I am a transactional lawyer, so that means I'm not the best public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| I'm going to use nowhere near my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| But the good news is, as a transactional lawyer, a lot of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| that the IDB faces are issues that come across my desk almost on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| I used to do a lot of real estate development, and then 2007 hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| And I do less of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I do a lot of regulatory consulting, and I do some tax controversy work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| both at the state and federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| When I was first contacted to ask if I would have any interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| in serving on these boards, I said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| And the question of why is lawyers, a lot of lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5000)|
| 1:23:28| provide a lot of pro bono work to residents of this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| who are in need of our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Well, there are very few people who call me or walk in my door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| that need transactional law or regulatory pro bono work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| Some of my clients might wish it was pro bono, but not necessarily the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| So what I found interesting in my career is that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| have to serve that public service need elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| And one way that I can do that is to serve on boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| where my experience proves to be a help to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| And so that's one of the reasons that I said yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| that I would certainly entertain service on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| So if you all have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5064)|
| 1:24:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5066)|
| 1:24:26| Next, I think, is Jan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5066)|
| 1:24:35| Jan Everidge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| My name is Jan Everidge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| My residence is at 8200 Bennington Drive in Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5083)|
| 1:24:51| I have lived in Knox County for 40 years, this fall, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| And I am currently with Home Federal Bank of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| I actually started with them a few weeks after I moved to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| so coming up on an anniversary with them as well this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| I have been in residential lending or regulatory compliance most of my banking career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5110)|
| 1:25:19| originally in Nashville, but for the past almost 40 years here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| So I have worked with a lot of affordable housing issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| initially serving as a lender who worked directly with individuals buying homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5128)|
| 1:25:35| and in many cases, using a lot of affordable housing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| It might have been THDA, programs through the county, programs through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| various programs like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| That was roughly the first half of my time at Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| The past 20 years or so, I have served in the compliance area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| I currently serve as senior compliance officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| and also the Community Reinvestment Act officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| Many people may or may not know that banks are under a regulatory requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| under something called the Community Reinvestment Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| to make sure that banks are serving the needs, the credit needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| especially of all the members of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| not just those who can bring the most deposits into the door for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| Through that, I have gotten to know a lot of the nonprofit organizations here in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| that work on the issues of affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| many of which I either in the past or currently serve on their board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| I've served on finance committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I've served as treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| So I have seen how many of the programs, again, local, state, or federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| can be utilized to help create or sustain affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| I do a lot of work with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| working with getting grant applications that help these nonprofit providers in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| get much-needed gap financing to make this housing possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| When it comes to regulatory issues, I read the Federal Register for a Living, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5238)|
| 1:27:26| So I'm very familiar with getting hundreds of pages of rather dense information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5246)|
| 1:27:35| and trying to then go through it and make it more practical for those who have to utilize that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| whether it's employees within our own organization or the nonprofits with whom I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| So I've worked with individuals wanting to buy or refinance or rehabilitate their own homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| as well as nonprofit developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| You can see in the information provided to you the groups that I'm currently interacting with on that behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5280)|

| 1:28:13| I'll be glad to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| All right, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Next is Mr. Michael Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| Yes, I'm Michael Wood, 1020 Lancewood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5308)|
| 1:28:36| That's quite a cast to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| So just thank you all for the opportunity to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| I got an unsolicited call several weeks ago from an existing member of the board asking if I would consider serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| and I tried to quickly respond, and I wasn't looking for anything else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| After quite a conversation with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| I was convinced that this may be a place that I could serve this community with some of the experience I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| I've been in the real estate business for 42 years here in Knox County, and I'm a lifelong resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| I've been involved with Wood Realtors as a principal owner for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| recently sold to Weikert Realtors and also Wood Development Group for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| and I've participated in some low-income housing tax credit programs here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| I've also been involved as a real estate broker, an owner, an investor in commercial and residential properties here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5366)|
| 1:29:35| I'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| This is simply an opportunity to give back some of what Knox County has given to me over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| and I would be honored to serve if asked, and if not, I've got a lot of good folks here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| so the Industrial Development Board is going to be in good hands regardless, so I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| All right. Thank you, Mr. Wood. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| Just a quick one for Mr. Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| I just want to let you know I appreciate your humor on the last line of your resume there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| You're very welcome. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| And just as a reminder, at the meeting next week, we'll go through our normal process where we appoint people to committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| so to be clear, those of you who have come tonight and spoken, you don't have to be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| Don't feel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| We'll go through the vote and the process, and then I'm guessing Todd will probably be the designee to let everybody know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| so no need to come back next week, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| Unless you want to stay, you're welcome to roll out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| Okay. That wraps up that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| Madam Clerk, what's our next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| Yeah, we do need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| We've had such a – the motion, the proper motion would be to send forward with no recommendations that we can vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| So we have a motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker and a second, I thought I saw from over here, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| So the proper – we've sent it forward with no recommendation to vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| Item number 13 is approving an amendment to contract number 17-781 with SunTrust Bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5480)|
| 1:31:30| for implementation of a Procurement Card Program for Norris County Schools Internal School Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| This is Resolution 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| And if some of the schools come down, I just want to pull this one, and I know we're already getting this meeting long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| I just wanted to kind of get a quick little insight on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| I know that we've got a whole consortium in this whole thing, but if you could give just kind of a quick –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| if this has been done to increase the potential for rebate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| or also to make it a little bit easier for the school finance team to review these P cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| if you could kind of give a little insight to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Yes, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| So what this does – currently, the contract reads – it just provides for the district, the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5526)|
| 1:32:14| And what this will do is this amendment will allow us for individual schools to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| and this would provide better internal controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| It would provide better spending controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| We're almost certain it would reduce audit findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| So, yes, it would come with a rebate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| What we would like to do, though, is initially, if this is approved, is to kind of ease this out to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| try it on a couple of schools to make sure this works with fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| And hopefully, over time, we would like to expand this to all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Ron, you said it helped with the audit findings, and we all know the history of the several programs that have been –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| how is this going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| You already had two-step verification, and what we had happen already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| So what is different with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| What this will do is this will actually help bookkeepers and allow us to have better control centrally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| because there will be – with the purchasing card, the schools currently don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| And so it's a lot of paper transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| There's a lot of requisitions, approvals going on at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| This will be – obviously, it will be automated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| And so – and it will also ease the workload on bookkeepers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| And so it would provide some capacity there in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| So we just think it has a lot of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| But again, we want to make sure we do this right rather than fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| But this is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| This will allow us to take it out to the individual schools, which we think would be a significant benefit for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| Ron, currently the PCAR program is handled through the finance department here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| Will all of the school stuff for the food program come through finance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| or will you all have separate controlling mechanisms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| Well, it would be – it's my understanding, and I may have to yield to procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| The county procurement helped us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| So Ben Charble was really good on helping us to work this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| The primary control would be – I mean, would be on Arient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| Importantly, though, we would welcome any oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| We would welcome any help on the county's end, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| But this would allow – there's 90 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| So what we would – you know, right now we don't have the capacity to do 90 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| We don't have the capacity to oversee it like we would like for 90 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| We do think that this would provide some budgetary savings through the rebates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| So eventually this may – this may help us free up also some positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| where we could actually monitor that as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| So I'll probably have to get back with you on that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| I can certainly run that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Garrett Radin, our internal school funds supervisor, worked with Ben on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| So I can get some more details for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| I'd be happy to do that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Since SunTrust Bank has gone through a transition now, that is not their legal entity name anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| Do we need to update the contract to reflect what the current name of that banking institution is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| I would probably have to yield to your procurement department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| Matt, Matt, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| I think we've already worked with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| They are still operating as SunTrust for our contract purposes at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| That may change in the next year, year and a half, or two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| We've been in contact with them and with SunTrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| How are you operating right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| For right now, it's still SunTrust for our contract purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Staying on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| Commissioner Smith has a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Ron, what amount of dollars do you anticipate flowing through this program within the first year, second year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| I'm sorry, Commissioner, can you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| What amount of dollars do you anticipate flowing through this card purchase program in year one, year two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| Goodness, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| Well, first off, we need to decide which particular schools we're going to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| We're probably going to pick two smaller schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| As far as an estimate, let me get with my supervisor on that, Garrett, and try to get a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5811)|
| 1:36:59| I can tell you right now, I think the majority of transactions will actually be used here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| So I would have to look at the actual activity at each of those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| But I can provide that, and I'll be providing some more clarification for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| So we'll get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| I know we've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Was there a motion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| We will need a motion on this one for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Beeler with a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| I think that would be – is that item 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| Item 22 is a resolution approving a purchase and sale agreement with Lillian J. Redmond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| for the purchase of three tracts of real property located at 10515, 10525, and 10539,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5877)|
| 1:38:06| Coward Mill Road, parcel ID 089240, number 10309201, and number 103092 for the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5886)|
| 1:38:22| price of $2,350,000, which property will be used for a new northwest county elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5902)|
| 1:38:29| school resolution 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| I pulled this, but I didn't pull it as a question really for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| I know when this first came before us, it was a question around engineering and roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| and access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| So, as I put in the form, I'd like Mr. Snowden to come down, kind of give a brief update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| to the commission, which by updating the commission, really you're updating the public on all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| work that's gone over the last month or two on some of the infrastructure out there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| So, Jim, if you could kind of give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| I'd be glad to, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Once we kind of located or once we were made aware of the location, we did consult with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| CDM Smith, one of the local civil engineering firms that does a lot of traffic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| for larger developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| Based on the school system's rezoning map that they shared with us, we kind of came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| to the conclusion that, you know, at minimum, there's going to be a doubling of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| on the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Right now, there's about 750 cars a day on Coward Mill Road in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| Best case scenario, it would be about 1,500 after the school was built and some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| development occurs around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| Worst case scenario, it would have been about 2,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| So, it was, you know, it was going to double traffic and maybe even as much as triple the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| traffic on the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| Our main concern was, you know, essentially safety for that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| It's right now 16 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| Based on our experience from previous studies and analysis, a 16 foot wide road with 750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| trips a day is probably okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| It's not going to exhibit high crash rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| A road that's 16 foot wide that has 2,300 cars a day or even, for that matter, 1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| cars a day is going to be potentially problematic from a safety perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| In addition to the fact you have a couple of horizontal curves that are problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| leading up to a one lane bridge, which obviously is not a good situation with school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| So, in conversations with the school system and the mayor's office, we were able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| to a partnership and compromise that we will fund approximately half the roadway improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| and they will fund the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| And what we're going to do is to make the roadway 20 feet wide, have two 10 foot lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| in both directions, turn lanes at the school proper to allow for school access, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6047)|
| 1:40:55| as sidewalks along one side of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| It may be greenway type configuration, but it will be a pedestrian facility that stretches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| the entirety of the road from Pellissippi to Chuck Jones Drive where the road kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| picks up and widens back up there near the Carnes Connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| We anticipate that cost to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| That also includes widening the bridge, or pardon me, replacing the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| We're most likely going to leave the existing bridge in place, let it serve as the pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| crossing for the creek, and then build a new bridge off alignment, or I guess most to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| south you would probably say, and have a two lane bridge with shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| That way people can pass on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| So that's where we're kind of at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| We're excited about the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| We think it's something that will benefit the community as well as the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| We've got a few commissioners with questions that we'll run through before we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| First Commissioner Smith, then Anders, then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| I have a question for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6123)|
| 1:42:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| Good evening, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| Good evening, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| I'm well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| It doesn't look like it, but I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| The need's getting better, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| I assume you guys did have an appraisal done on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| And in that appraisal, did they appraise it for value as a school system, or how did they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| determine highest and best use for the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Highest and best use is the term, I believe, that the appraisers used for making that appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6162)|
| 1:42:52| Did anywhere in the reflection of the value, did anything addressing the inadequacy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| the facility roads play into the value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| If I remember correctly, the appraisal did discuss the road and the wits, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| remember a direct connection to the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6194)|

| 1:43:16| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Thank you, Jim, for the work that you guys have done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| I know that the school system looked at multiple sites, and then this spot came upon us pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6202)|
| 1:43:34| quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| So, I do appreciate the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| What partnerships with the state allowed us to kind of get to this dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6218)|
| 1:43:45| Because Coward Mill coming into Pellissippi is going to be closed off, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| And the second question would be, when is the work on Pellissippi and Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| supposed to lead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| I believe we funded that last year's budget, or this year's current year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| I'll take the shorter question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| I spoke with Charles Blaylock and Sons, or their representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| The state has led that project to Charles Blaylock and Sons for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| They're ordering signal equipment and kind of getting things ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| So, that project, you'll see actual construction out there at the interchange within the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| One of the reasons why we were able to work with the school system as well as we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| was, we've applied, when we budgeted for Cherahala's extension, it was actually intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6268)|
| 1:44:35| to go all the way to Horseshoe Bend Road to eliminate both access points at Horseshoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| Bend and at Coward Mill as part of the long-term improvement of making Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| access control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| In discussing that, we realized that, really, that second leg, or from Coward Mill north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6287)|
| 1:44:54| that's benefiting TDOT greatly, much more so than even us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| So, we approached them about what's called local interstate connector money, or it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| commonly referred to as LIC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| That funding is 50% state and 50% local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| So, we were able to save probably a couple of million dollars with the commitment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| the state, and that money will, in essence, go into the project for the road widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| along Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Thank you for your work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Mr. Snowden, for at least the last couple of years, we've talked about the numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| infrastructure projects that have been put aside, put behind, or put down the list so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| far that I think Commissioner Anders has often asked if we'd ever get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| I applaud the infrastructure project getting ahead of waiting until there's a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| I'm the first one to say we ought to do more of this, but this has sort of magically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| appeared and fast-tracked ahead of at least a dozen other infrastructure projects that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| are not even on the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| So, did any of that discussion happen, or is this just a, hey, they picked a site, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| better catch up fast before we have another problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Where does this fall in the priorities of all the other things going on in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Yeah, and you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| I mean, absent the school, we wouldn't be necessarily looking at the roadway for improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| just because that level of traffic on that width of road wouldn't necessarily precipitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| that, but we know that adding that additional traffic would have created that problem, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| we want to be proactive and take the savings from that project and apply it here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| the money was appropriated for that north leg, so we felt like it was the fair thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| to do to add it to the improvements along Calvert Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| And just to clarify, you'd already had money budgeted for the northern leg from Calvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| Mill up behind Faith Promise and Horseshoe, I think it's Horseshoe Bend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| And the state is willing to put more into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Because I was curious about how we ended up with the magic $2 million that, in a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| where we're talking budget cuts, we found some savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Yeah, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| The state pays 50% of LIC money, so that project probably is going to be in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| of $3 to $4 million if there's quite a bit of earthwork up there that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| so we anticipate the state will have $2 million in it, and we'll have $2 million, whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| we previously thought we might have as much as $4 million in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| And what's the timeline on that northern leg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| That is one of the drawbacks of using some of that state money is it does take a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| Most likely it will probably be somewhere in the next 3 to 5 years, whereas otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| it may have been in the next 2 to 3 years, so it does add a couple of years to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| So, just to be clear, the Cherahala extension is going forward first, then Calvert Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6468)|
| 1:47:57| you said all the way to Pellissippi, but if that's going to be closed, that seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| I'm not sure why we would put money into that, but let's just say Calvert Mill, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| you've proposed will come in in the next couple years before the school comes online in 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| We will definitely have Cherahala extended much before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| We're going to let it later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| One of the next items on the agenda is a civil design contract with Cannon & Cannon for Calvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| Mill improvements, and we will have to expedite those, but we are fairly confident that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| can have that road improved by the time the school opens in August of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| Including building a brand new bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| In 2 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Probably less than that, because we'll have, most likely we'll have to have design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| right-of-way procurement, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| But yes, we think that we can have the road, if not completed, at least operating to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| point that we feel comfortable with it within the next 2 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| That would be the fastest infrastructure project in the history of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| But the northern leg will not be anywhere close to that opening, so it's really only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| going to alleviate sort of southbound pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| It's not going to give it that extra corridor until the state hits, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Just want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| This is a question for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| I appreciate your work on the questions, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| But my question is for the school system in the middle of a pandemic and the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| expanding schools and the direction infrastructure, physical infrastructure is taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| Could you talk to me about where we are going with the need for a school if most of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6581)|
| 1:49:49| class work or are we moving in the direction of an online format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| And why are we looking at expanding the capacity of a physical building versus looking at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| we can manage the existing resources better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| You know, the question you ask gets us in the middle of a discussion that we're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| having right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| And I can tell you we don't have any intent at this point in time to give up our standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| classroom instruction and the relationship that teachers have with their students in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| The distance learning and the online components that we're talking about are an augmentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6628)|
| 1:50:36| to that and they are intended to, you know, help us continue instruction in cases where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6636)|
| 1:50:45| we may not be able to do it, you know, based on social distancing or other issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6645)|
| 1:50:53| may arise in the health field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| So we're looking at trying to facilitate a longer term discussion between distance learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| and the needs of children and teachers and the relationship that school brings to families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| And I think what our absence from the classroom over the last, you know, several months has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| indicated, even as, and it's not just here in Knox County, I think it's statewide and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| nationwide has indicated that, you know, while we can in a lot of respects deliver instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| the, remotely, so to speak, the pedagogy required for that is not the same as pedagogy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6689)|
| 1:51:42| may be required for instruction in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| It's significantly different and we found that students need that classroom experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| So are we, which is part of the conversation, so we're looking to incorporate both and expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6713)|
| 1:52:01| upon those or we're focused on just making sure we meet the needs in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| Or we are just beginning the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| I can tell you what we're looking at to meet the facility needs in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6729)|
| 1:52:15| To speak more broadly about the instructional piece of that, I would have to ask Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| Roswick to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| Please, because my concern is we're in the middle of technology and infrastructure in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| broadband and access to schools, especially in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| And I'm just trying to figure out where we are as we begin to answer some of these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| infrastructure, pedagogy, in terms of our infrastructure and how we're connecting students and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| and to deal with some of those same conversations we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| As Mr. Oaks said, this is where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| I think it's a place we in education have been trying to go for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| Part of our K-12 education has always been to expose students to online and be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| I think what this pandemic did was kind of force that to happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| And we weren't as prepared as we would like to have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| And that's why we saw a lot of review materials and to finish the spring as opposed to new materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| If that same thing happens this fall, we will be prepared to deliver instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| Mr. Oaks makes a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| You can't replace a teacher and that interaction that students have with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| We really look at technology as a tool for the classroom to be enhanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| and for those opportunities sometimes to expand beyond the four walls and maybe help with things like summer learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| An example of that, we were able to offer an ACT online support class this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| because of the pandemic, because students didn't have a chance to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| and courses they usually would have taken or after school things they would have taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| We had 771 juniors sign up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| We think that's fertile ground for the types of things we can do with technology and school coexisting at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| And so we think those opportunities for that are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| And I think what we do will continue to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| A conversation I had with Dr. Wise at Pellissippi, we talked during this and we were trying to come up with a way to get buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| to pick up students to take them to the Magnolia campus to take dual enrollment courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| When they went online and they had that capability, all of a sudden we realized by putting a computer in the hands of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| we now can get them exposure to online college credit courses without paying the transportation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| So I think there are things like that, as was said, that we're learning right now that are huge advantages to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| But we've never been confused that you can't replace a teacher and the teacher in the classroom are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| So I think a lot of it will be innovation and experimenting and finding the right pockets for where that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6905)|
| 1:55:12| And unfortunately, because we don't know if this will come back and what extent, it also provides us a backup plan for instruction if we were to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| Thank you, Jim, and thank you to our partners at the school team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| We do need a motion on this particular item to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| All right, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| So is that the IT or excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| Item 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| Could I get a motion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| All right, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Smith with a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6974)|

| 1:56:39| All right, we have a motion to approve the traffic management system, Phase 2, in the amount of $215,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| which amount will be reimbursed to Knox County through a Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| grant resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| Yeah, thanks, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| And this is a very convoluted project that's been in front of this board, I count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| This year, we had Phase 2 approved in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| We had a Phase 1 amendment in April, and now this contract for Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| The design is going to be in two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| The construction will be in one phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| That one phase will include all the signals along Maynardville Highway and along Cedar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| Bluff and Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| It will add camera detection to where we can make real-time adjustments to the signal timings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| from our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| That project, hopefully, is slated to start sometime next spring for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| How long is construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| Most of the work is what you would consider behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| It's working in a cabinet, hanging fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| It's not necessarily bulldozers and dirt, so to speak, but probably somewhere in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| neighborhood of six to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| This is something that, one place where technology can actually help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| You don't always need more payment to make things flow better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| It was this type of technology the city is utilizing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| This was reviewed and discussed extensively in the TPO committee meetings over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| I was thrilled after being on TPO for a while to see this stuff finally coming from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| to here for ratification, knowing that this will make a difference in terms of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| To the Mayor's chagrin, I think I made a bad joke in the TPO meeting where the punch line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| was Waze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| There's no way you made a bad joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| I won't say the joke, but you can ask me after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Mayor Jacobs, to this day, doesn't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7118)|
| 1:58:44| We have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7124)|
