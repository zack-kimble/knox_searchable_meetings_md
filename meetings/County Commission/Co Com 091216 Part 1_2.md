| 3:46:27| it could also be a safety issue as well with because the reason why they're blowing their horns is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13587)|
| 3:46:33| because they don't have the proper safety mechanisms at those crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13593)|
| 3:46:39| And that's why, I guess, they're required to blow their horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13599)|
| 3:46:43| And so, since we don't have a chance to discuss things outside of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13603)|
| 3:46:52| is to go ahead and talk about the subject of railroad crossings and safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13612)|
| 3:46:57| It is an expensive thing to put up the guard rails that come down and the flashing lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13617)|
| 3:47:06| because that would end up being evidently a cost for the county, not for the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13626)|
| 3:47:12| And I didn't know if other commissioners were getting contacted by their constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13632)|
| 3:47:18| or if they had some of these same concerns because I do think that especially, you know, this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13638)|
| 3:47:25| there's a lot of residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| There's thousands of homes in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13647)|
| 3:47:30| And I would assume that the traffic at one of these crosses is tremendous to not have some of these safety features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13650)|
| 3:47:39| that shouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| And if the railroad companies aren't going to put them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13661)|
| 3:47:44| then maybe we need to as a county put them in for the safety of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13664)|
| 3:47:48| And it's not just, although these folks live in the fifth district, across the tracks is the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13668)|
| 3:47:57| So it's not simply just, you know, the fifth district and my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13677)|
| 3:48:03| But I do think that there's got to be other crossings throughout the county that need to have something done about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13683)|
| 3:48:13| those crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13693)|
| 3:48:14| And I just wanted to throw it out there and see what some of my fellow commissioners had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13694)|
| 3:48:21| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13701)|
| 3:48:22| Commissioner Lutho, I believe they are required, a fast freight is required to blow that horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13702)|
| 3:48:27| regardless if there's railroad crossings there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| Well, the law department has looked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13709)|
| 3:48:33| Joe, would you talk about quiet zones and what's required for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13713)|
| 3:48:38| Well, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, in a nutshell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13718)|
| 3:48:41| railroad crossings are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13721)|
| 3:48:46| Now, the Federal Railroad Administration will regulate the manner in which alert is given by way of horns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13726)|
| 3:48:53| and bells, et cetera, from oncoming trains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13733)|
| 3:48:56| In some states, and I went through this four years ago for my county in Florida when I was a law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13736)|
| 3:49:01| I made a petition for a quiet zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13741)|
| 3:49:04| It will depend upon the exact site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13744)|
| 3:49:07| There are some zones that the Federal Railroad Administration would deem inappropriate for a quiet zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13747)|
| 3:49:13| regardless of the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| But if, in fact, the administration would entertain a petition, what they would essentially do is they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13755)|
| 3:49:21| investigate the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13761)|
| 3:49:24| They would determine whether or not it was appropriate for a safety zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13764)|
| 3:49:27| You'd have to make application with the Federal Railroad Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| likewise make application with the affected railroad because, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13770)|
| 3:49:33| if you tell a railroad henceforth they're not going to have to ring a bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13773)|
| 3:49:37| they're going to want some kind of release of liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| and that's going to come with a change in the manner in which the railroad crossing is constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13779)|
| 3:49:44| So it could possibly, if, in fact, the federal government deems it appropriate for modification to a safety zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13784)|
| 3:49:51| and the affected railroad likewise agrees, then you would be tasked with upgrading the crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13791)|
| 3:50:00| and then maintaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13800)|
| 3:50:02| And then, of course, in so doing, under basic government tort law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13802)|
| 3:50:07| anything you do would have to be done in a non-negligent manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| That means yearly maintenance and ensuring that, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13809)|
| 3:50:14| it's constantly maintained and good working in proper order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13814)|
| 3:50:20| You know, I live in a flight zone right now over at the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| and I've lived right beside railroad tracks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| And normally, after you've lived there a while, you never notice them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13828)|
| 3:50:32| I can't even tell you when a plane flies over my house now, but if you came over there you would notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13832)|
| 3:50:37| But, you know, like I say, I've worked for the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13837)|
| 3:50:42| I was a brakeman on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13842)|
| 3:50:44| And those fast freights, it takes them miles to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13844)|
| 3:50:49| They're pushing a lot of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| And I've been on trains that have hit cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| So, you know, I think that we could be open ourselves for a big liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13853)|
| 3:50:57| And I believe when I first saw this resolution on county commission, it was talking about Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13857)|
| 3:51:04| somewhere down around in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13864)|
| 3:51:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13865)|
| 3:51:06| That's where the complaints have been coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13866)|
| 3:51:08| But I think we're open up for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13868)|
| 3:51:11| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13871)|
| 3:51:12| Isn't that the place where we had the coaches killed down there by the train?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13872)|
| 3:51:17| Yes, that was at Cessna Drive at Westland, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13877)|
| 3:51:20| You know, we really have to be careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13880)|
| 3:51:24| I think Majors' brother even got killed there, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13884)|
| 3:51:27| You know, so, you know, we want to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13887)|
| 3:51:30| We could be putting a big liability on the county here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13890)|
| 3:51:34| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13894)|
| 3:51:36| Just real quickly, what was the estimate to put in one of those crossing guards where they dropped the bar down to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13896)|
| 3:51:43| traffic from crossing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13903)|
| 3:51:45| I guess you'd have to put a light up there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13905)|
| 3:51:47| It's been a few years since the one I was involved with, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13907)|
| 3:51:51| but it would depend upon the requirements set forth by both the railroad and the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13911)|
| 3:51:56| But several hundred thousand dollars, I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13916)|
| 3:51:59| I think ours was $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13919)|
| 3:52:01| And that's, of course, that was four years ago when I initiated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13921)|
| 3:52:05| Because I believe that even there on Westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13925)|
| 3:52:07| and I'm not sure if they're talking about that one where you cross the railroad tracks and you turn on Barbie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13927)|
| 3:52:12| but if you just go down the road probably another half a mile, there's another crossing right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13932)|
| 3:52:17| You've got Gallagher and then further on you've got, is it Cessna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13937)|
| 3:52:21| So you've got the three crossings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| And I don't believe Cessna probably, does Cessna have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13943)|
| 3:52:27| And that might be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13947)|
| 3:52:28| No protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13948)|
| 3:52:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13949)|
| 3:52:30| And you've got subdivisions that are on both sides basically backing up to that and people crossing continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13950)|
| 3:52:38| And right now there is no protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13958)|
| 3:52:42| And like you say, Commissioner Pinkston, if just the blowing of the horn and it's going to take them a mile to stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13962)|
| 3:52:50| that's not in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13970)|
| 3:52:51| I mean, they're not going to be able to stop by the time you can blow a horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13971)|
| 3:52:57| That's not enough protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13977)|
| 3:52:58| In my mind, that's why those horns are so loud so you can hear them a long ways off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13978)|
| 3:53:04| You know, and I don't know how far away they're blowing that horn so that someone trying to cross there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13984)|
| 3:53:13| if it's in sight, you know, I don't know what the regulations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13993)|
| 3:53:16| So, you know, I just feel that, you know, that's a particular place that should be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=13996)|
| 3:53:23| But I think there's probably other places throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14003)|
| 3:53:27| And as far as getting used to it, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14007)|
| 3:53:32| I've been getting a lot of e-mails from people that they're not getting used to it, the sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14012)|
| 3:53:40| You have a lot of new constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| In fact, there's someone here tonight from that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14022)|
| 3:53:45| I don't know if she wishes to speak or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14025)|
| 3:53:49| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| I read the memo from Law Director Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14031)|
| 3:53:55| And thank you, Commissioner Lutho, for pointing this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14035)|
| 3:53:58| I'll just speak as a commissioner and as a guy who was in the business for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14038)|
| 3:54:04| I'll start out by saying that the railroads spend, I'll downplay it, hundreds of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14044)|
| 3:54:09| if not millions, lobbying Congress to make sure they're preempted from people like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14049)|
| 3:54:14| They're federally preempted from local state, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14054)|
| 3:54:20| And so they can't go through all the cities and they have millions of ordinances to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14060)|
| 3:54:25| I'm not defending the railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| But, of course, Fenbar and I have that same railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14067)|
| 3:54:30| That's the Norfolk Southern Main to Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14070)|
| 3:54:32| It has about 35 to 40 trains a day on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14072)|
| 3:54:35| You have a staley train and you have a couple of locals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14075)|
| 3:54:38| We talk about one train, it goes each way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| So that's two times it goes across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14080)|
| 3:54:41| And you have a 30 plus to Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| So you have probably 40 trains a day on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14084)|
| 3:54:47| They can go as fast as 39 miles an hour through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14087)|
| 3:54:50| They don't always go that fast, but more likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| I see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14092)|
| 3:54:53| I'm about a mile south of that track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14093)|
| 3:54:55| And we have a heavy concentration of Lawford Road, you know, lies parallel to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14095)|
| 3:55:04| Of course, they're not at a crossing, but they get a crossing to the west at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14104)|
| 3:55:08| they would have it at Bomb Drive and to the east behind Buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14108)|
| 3:55:11| So they got about a mile, but still they would hear it constantly throughout the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14111)|
| 3:55:16| And I hear people talk about it, but I rarely hear a, what can you do about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14116)|
| 3:55:21| And the Cessna Road, you're right, that is where all the UT coaches were killed in 66 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14121)|
| 3:55:26| Cessna is unprotected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14126)|
| 3:55:28| Those things cost a minimum of $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14128)|
| 3:55:32| I mean, that's bargain basement price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| And you've still got people running around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14134)|
| 3:55:36| I mean, people still running around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14136)|
| 3:55:38| Obviously, their concern is liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14138)|
| 3:55:43| And if their engineers did not blow the whistle and there was protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14143)|
| 3:55:49| and some carload of kids went around it, they would still get sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14149)|
| 3:55:52| I mean, who knows what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14152)|
| 3:55:54| They would probably have to pay a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14154)|
| 3:55:56| And, again, I sound like I'm defending the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14158)|
| 3:55:59| I don't mean to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| I said they were fairly preemptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14161)|
| 3:56:03| But let me mention they are subject to public pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14163)|
| 3:56:06| If you look what's happening just up to the east of Commissioners Wright and Armstrong in New Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14166)|
| 3:56:11| they are subject to public opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| And they care because they're taking a beating up there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14173)|
| 3:56:17| with wanting to put that distribution center, you know, the locals and whatnot is going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14177)|
| 3:56:23| So they are subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14183)|
| 3:56:24| I'm trying to get some Norfolk Southern Corporation out on below Mayo's there as they wind the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14184)|
| 3:56:30| I'm just trying to get somebody to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| They'll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14192)|
| 3:56:37| The crew will say, the TDOC crew or construction crew gets a call, get out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14197)|
| 3:56:41| There's a train coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14201)|
| 3:56:42| They get out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14202)|
| 3:56:43| It's three hours later and nothing's come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14203)|
| 3:56:44| That's all I'm going to try to get some communication going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14204)|
| 3:56:47| But I guess I'm just rambling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| But locally, all we could do, I believe, is ask Norfolk Southern to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14209)|
| 3:56:55| We could petition for a quiet zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| Yeah, petition for a quiet zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| And without the protection of a minimum of $300,000 crossing, they're going to be reluctant to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14219)|
| 3:57:04| Even if the guys come in, you can slow order them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14224)|
| 3:57:07| I mean, they will usually just slow order if there's construction, like Mayo's there, concrete and whatnot, bridges above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14227)|
| 3:57:14| They can slow order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14234)|
| 3:57:15| It slows them down to ten usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14235)|
| 3:57:18| But still they can still hit somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14238)|
| 3:57:20| Their main concern, of course, is liability, hitting a car of people, a carload of people or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14240)|
| 3:57:27| and being millions of dollars in lawsuits and judgments and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14247)|
| 3:57:32| But they are subject to us saying, hey, we hope you'll do this or do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14252)|
| 3:57:37| Hope you'll slow your train down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14257)|
| 3:57:40| But to just think they would realistically say we'll quit blowing our horns between ten at night and six in the morning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14260)|
| 3:57:50| probably a stretch just because of the liability issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14270)|
| 3:57:55| Do you feel that if we petition for a quiet zone that would help these folks out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14275)|
| 3:57:59| It's certainly worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14279)|
| 3:58:00| And given the, if Knox County were willing to spend the money for these extra safety devices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14280)|
| 3:58:07| It's certainly worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14287)|
| 3:58:09| And the question is, do the safety devices, if someone goes around the gate and with the bells flashing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14289)|
| 3:58:16| and all of that, does that not limit their liability if they do hit someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14296)|
| 3:58:22| In theory, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14302)|
| 3:58:24| But what limits it is what an attorney saying, turning on the tears with a jury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14304)|
| 3:58:29| if there's been a catastrophe happen, that's what their horror is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14309)|
| 3:58:36| When I was in the business down here at Calhoun, some guy, he ran into the train but sued the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14316)|
| 3:58:42| Nobody was hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14322)|
| 3:58:43| I don't know that, well, if that's true, then blowing your horn isn't going to give them any protection either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14323)|
| 3:58:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14330)|
| 3:58:51| There are run-around proof protections, but they run the tab up to about half a million to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14331)|
| 3:59:00| the things that will go across both lanes of traffic and will, in theory, prohibit anyone from crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14340)|
| 3:59:05| Well, I just wanted to present it out here so that we can discuss this and is this an option we would like to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14345)|
| 3:59:13| for not just this location but other locations throughout the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14353)|
| 3:59:17| Is this something that we, as a local community, would like to maybe try to help control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14357)|
| 3:59:27| whether it's the nuisance of the noise but also the safety factor at that crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14367)|
| 3:59:33| especially since there are so many crossings that have no safety issues or devices there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14373)|
| 3:59:42| Most do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14382)|
| 3:59:44| Most don't, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14384)|
| 3:59:47| It's certainly worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14387)|
| 3:59:48| I didn't mean to be negative about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14388)|
| 3:59:49| It's worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14389)|
| 3:59:51| Ed, you're not negative there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14391)|
| 3:59:53| You're stating facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14393)|
| 3:59:54| It's just like you're reading a paper all the time where somebody will go to sleep on the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14394)|
| 4:00:01| they get run over by the train, and yet they sue and collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14401)|
| 4:00:04| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14404)|
| 4:00:05| And they have to protect their interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14405)|
| 4:00:07| I'm not upholding them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14407)|
| 4:00:09| But if they don't sound that horn, they will be found liable even if they have a safety crossing there in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14409)|
| 4:00:16| They should have took that action to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14416)|
| 4:00:18| If going around a closed gate doesn't relieve some of their liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14418)|
| 4:00:26| I don't think blowing of the horn is going to relieve much of it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14426)|
| 4:00:29| What you get into, though, Craig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| is a lot of people say they didn't see that light and that thing coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14431)|
| 4:00:35| You know, they get hit anyway, you know, and they get sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14435)|
| 4:00:39| They'll protect their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14439)|
| 4:00:40| You know, they own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14440)|
| 4:00:42| I don't even know whether we could put a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14442)|
| 4:00:45| You used to work for the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| I don't even know whether we could put those safety features there or not because that is their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14447)|
| 4:00:52| They will, of course, if the county wants to come up and pay for it, they will cooperate and let you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14452)|
| 4:00:57| We have a lot of these underpasses here in Knox County where water stands in under them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14457)|
| 4:01:01| We can't even go in and improve that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| It's sort of like the high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14464)|
| 4:01:05| Well, we have to have their permission, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14465)|
| 4:01:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14466)|
| 4:01:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14467)|
| 4:01:08| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14468)|
| 4:01:09| And that's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14469)|
| 4:01:10| That would be part of that whole petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091216part1?start=14470)|
