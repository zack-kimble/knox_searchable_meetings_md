| 0:10:02| which is composed of items marked with a C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| These items are considered non-controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| and are voted on all at once in order to save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=608)|

| 0:10:33| So once an item is approved as part of the consent list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| there will be no further discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=637)|

| 0:14:51| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Scott Busby, Smee Busby Architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Yeah, this project has taken an interesting life arc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| When we first designed this, we met with the plans review department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| and had a great meeting with them and were informed that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| interpretation of the somewhat nebulous DKG definition was wrong and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| that residential wasn't allowed on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| The project was submitted with seven live work units that are on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| ground floor along with probably more than half the ground floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| as retail, coffee shop, office space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| We've not gotten a real clear definition from plans review whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| live work would be consistent with a commercial or a residential as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| as the zoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| So we're still kind of waiting to sort of understand whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| I think staff had a couple questions about the fact that it's live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| work, does that technically qualify as commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Because it could be someone like a therapist or a small maker space was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| the intention of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| We had a little discussion about this Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| And just also for the record, plans review suggested that we apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| the DKB and so that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Can you help me understand what you can't do right now with your plan if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| it's remained in the DKG zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| DKG does not allow true residential on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| I thought that you said your application, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| already had planned for the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Live work, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| And staff has, I guess, recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| But we went to the whole idea of rezoning because residential is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| in the boulevard district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| And that's what we were told would be our best path to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I think the staff got it right with their recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| So regardless, I think that State Street really does need more activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1043)|
| 0:17:32| The concept of a 24-hour city requires both dwelling and commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| and that is the most sustainable form of a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| So I think it's appropriate that DKG is in this area and that it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| commercial on the ground floor to provide more opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| pedestrians through all hours of the day and evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| So I don't see the DKB being appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1077)|
| 0:18:08| I think that if they are wanting to pursue the live work and they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| waiting an answer from plans review, then I could see maybe they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1094)|
| 0:18:25| interested in postponing and then revisiting it after they hear back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| But as it is, I don't think I could support DKB on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I guess I would like to hear from Samuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| At the discussion that we had on Tuesday, I thought that live work was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| appropriate for the DKG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| I'll be able to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I have not spoken with plans review inspections directly, so I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| definitively say whether the live work space will be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| non-residential in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| My impression was that it was going to be considered non-residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| that it would be permitted, but I can't say that 100% this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| Lizette, what do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| With that, I guess I do agree with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| Just given the topography of the plot, the fact that it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| Broadway, I do agree that the current zoning is appropriate for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| spot, and I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I've still got the furrowed brow because I'm trying to sort through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| I think I want to just say I am very excited about the proposal to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| something on that parcel other than a surface parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| That's why I feel awkward about denying this, because I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| there to be a misperception about what I think would really be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| there is to extend development on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| But I am curious about the idea of postponing if it's simply a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| of timing to get an approval back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| I'm not exactly sure what that timing would be or if that helps in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| If we can further discuss that, if you don't care, let's hear the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| remaining comments and maybe we'll readdress that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I hope I didn't cut in front of anybody over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I guess I have a bit of a different, respectfully, view about that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| I'm all about a 24-hour city and everything that goes along with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| but the exact location of this one next to Marble Alley Loss, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| already has residential on the main level, and the zoning was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| after that was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| As you go down State Street, there's no other draw down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| There's nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| The big parking garage at that point and on the other side of that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| lot of interstate interchanges and a substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| So to me, there's not going to be as much draw back there for a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| type venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Just making the comment that personally I feel okay and more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| with just residential on the lower level as well, just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Yes, with all due respect to my other commissioners, I would agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| with Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| I'm all in favor of a 24-hour city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| I mean, just looking where this is, where this location is, it just seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| like it lends itself to residential on that bottom floor, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| considering the success of the development right next door to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| The Marble Alley has been really kind of a spark that started a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| what's going on downtown right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| I think it also gives the developer a lot more leeway with making this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| development work, which is something we really need right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| So I would be in full support of a DKV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1344)|
| 0:22:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| After listening to everybody, I think where I'm at right this second is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| I don't want to deny something and the applicant have to start over, nor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| do I want to just approve something and it's not the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Looking at the fact that we're not able right this second to give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| definitive answer, I would be more in line of saying let's hit pause for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| 30 days, let's get a more definitive answer on the questions he's asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| so that he's not starting back from the beginning or getting things out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| So I would be leaning right this second more towards that 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| point so that we can give him a more solid answer than we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| something a little more rock solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| I think that postponing 30 days, if the answer is you cannot do live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| work, so then by postponing it, it comes back before us because we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| to make the project work, I guess would be the reason to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| But I don't agree that we should have continued residential on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Although the Marble Alley was a successful development, it has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| activated that street level over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| If you walk by there and run by there, the Cal Johnson building's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| reopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| So I think really Marble Alley was a good test case to show why the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| is what it is now to help promote an activated street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| And so I would not be in favor of changing it to the boulevard zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| And I don't really see what postponing it does if that's ultimately the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| discussion and the choice between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| So I'm okay postponing it, but I think ultimately I would vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| it in another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| So just to sort through all the comments, if it was denied today, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| request was denied today, I'm looking at everyone here because I just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| a little guidance, then the applicant could continue to pursue live work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1486)|
| 0:24:54| and if that was approved, he could still move forward with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| development, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| And if it is denied and the live work idea is also denied, then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| developer would only be allowed to move forward with all commercial on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| the first floor if they so chose to continue the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| I guess first of all, I'm in favor of postponing for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| But second, I just had a question about potentially setting precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Is there any danger in sort of setting the precedent for rezoning DKG to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| DKB if there's a lot of other DKG downtown and at some point all parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| of a redeveloping downtown are going to lack kind of amenities that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| make them attractive for walking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| So I'm just curious if that's a concern that we should be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| I don't think there's a precedent here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| I think you look at these cases uniquely and the surrounding area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| say, is this appropriate or is it not appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| So however we choose, I don't think we're setting a trend or a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| but this was a unique look at a specific case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| Would you agree with that, Ms. Executive Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| In general, yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| I mean, you should look at each individual request on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| I do think you do need to consider does this ask the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| I think it's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Are we setting a precedent here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| And that's something that you all need to decide as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| You know, I wish we had someone here from plans review because I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| I mean, what happens if live work, I mean, think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| First of all, the enforcement of live work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| What if I'm living and working and then I retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Am I legal nonconforming now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Because now I'm just living and not working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| I mean, really, it seems a bit like I'm not the best written language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1626)|
| 0:27:17| There are areas of, there are pockets of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| that I think are very challenging for retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I think I cited, as a matter of fact, I'm going to withhold my comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| until all the lights are, I want to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| I want to give everybody a chance before I finish my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| I don't know if the developers, would it be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| to hear the developers take on this, the guy that's going to build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Well, I think Mr. Busby is representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| He's here, if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Mr. Goss is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Buzz Goss with Marvel Island Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| I actually live at 300 State Street, which is right next door to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| And so I appreciate everything that's being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| and I understand where each of you who have spoken up come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| So I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Thank you, Commissioner Browning, to allow me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| You know, when it comes to urban design and development in downtowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| I've kind of been involved in it for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| and some of the things I think that are, it's easy to forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| are that in this type of development, in this type of city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| you have A streets, B streets, and C streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| So A is like your high street, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| like the one that we all know about in London or Paris or New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| and that would be Gay Street and Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| And B streets would be, say, the streets in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| And then C streets, State Street, Walnut, places like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| they're further off the grid, they have less connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| and they're not really appropriate for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| And I understand why the zoning was done this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| I opposed it whenever it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I said, listen, you can't tell everybody you have to build commercial on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| every ground floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| You can compel them, but developments are what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| And if I had to do nothing but commercial on this ground floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I won't do this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| It's not possible, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| That's just the facts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| That's a lot of rent that I'm not sure that I could collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| The closer you get to the baseball stadium, that's a different matter altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| There's a lot of activity, a lot of interest in sports bars and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| State Street doesn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Next to me is the State Street parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| which has nothing on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Across the street from that is the back of the theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Now, we're all better because the theater is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| but there's nothing to activate the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Across the street from me is the Promenade parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Nothing's on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Next to that is the old Cal Johnson building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| which is beautifully restored with a commercial space that's been vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| since they completed that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| It's not really possible to tell me to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| and expect me to be able to go out there and recruit tenants because I can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| and the equity and the funding that will happen in a deal like this is not possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| if the street was alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| And I get what you say, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| When you drive down in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Marble Alley Lofts did not activate the street, but we made it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| And we built those ground floor units as walk-up units with full heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| storefront, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| When the market comes, it can be converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| These will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| We're putting in retail in the corner, activating that corner, outdoor space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| things that make it lively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| All of our commercial amenities for our tenants, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| And we also have some office spaces on the back side of the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| I'd put those offices on the front, except you can't really bury a residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| with no windows and things like that in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| So that's why we've developed a way that we've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Smee Busby and McCarty, holds up a McCarty MHM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| They've done a really great job designing this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| and it's going to be a beautiful building, and I believe it's going to be an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| I think it's going to do what Marble Alley Lofts did, right, another catalyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| And maybe, right, maybe I'll get to buy the parking garage across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| and make something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| But today it's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| You know, this is a C Street, and as much as I would love to have commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| it's just not possible financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| I appreciate everything you've had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| We didn't think we needed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| We didn't have to change the zoning at Marble Alley Lofts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| It was accepted that we could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| and they asked us to do the ground floor units in a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| We're only here because we've been asked to come here, told we had to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| And so I'd appreciate your help in getting this building and this development done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you, Mr. Goss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I know we've got some lights here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| but I think it might be a better order to ask Mr. Ahrens to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| because it seems like we have a lot of questions that would be related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| or addressed to Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Peter Ahrens, Plains Review and Inspections Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| How can I answer some questions for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| A couple of things I'd like to start with is let's talk about the LIVWRK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| and how you view that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| I don't view it any way other than the code defines it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| That's what I'm going to pull up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| LIVWRK, a structure where residential and commercial uses are integrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| that permits businesses, professions, occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Mr. Ahrens, could you come closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| A structure where residential and commercial uses are integrated that permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| businesses, professions, occupations, or trades within a residential dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| that requires employees, customers, clients, and or patrons to visit the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| Okay, so I'm a, like I used this example Tuesday, I'm a therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| So I'm my employee, if you will, okay, and I have a sofa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| and I sit down and talk to my clients, and now I no longer want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=1996)|
| 0:33:25| Now what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| I think the intent is to have a storefront where the residence is either behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| What was submitted to our offices shows an entrance from State Street into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| what appears to be a living room with a kitchen right along the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| It looks like every standard residential unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| and so that's why we let the applicant know that that's not a LIVWRK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| You've got a LIVLIV right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| I'm not trying to stir up an argument here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| But I think it's good, healthy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Then it sounds like we're now moving from an ordinance to interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| and who's to say that I can't run a business with a kitchen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| And why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| It just seems a little arbitrary to me because it seems like you could run a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| business with a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Well, you can run a business out of a storage facility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| But wouldn't that be more in the design standard rather than?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| We didn't see any evidence of opportunities for a business to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| We saw, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I wouldn't call my wife working from the kitchen table a LIVWRK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| That's just my wife working at the kitchen table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| A LIVWRK would be where customers come and they either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| it's a professional environment versus entering somebody's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| But does it say that in what you just read to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| Well, that requires customers, clients, and or patrons to visit the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| But couldn't a customer visit a unit with a kitchen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| You see where we're going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| It seems nearly impossible to distinguish if, I mean, I could, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| game the system, if you will, or not necessarily game the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| just say it's LIVWRK, and you tell me why it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| We have told them that it's not because there's no business features built into these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2150)|
| 0:35:59| It's just a residential unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Okay, but let's go back to the code there and what business features are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| What's your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| They're recruiting the businesses because they don't have a business right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| So just like I built a shopping center with no tenants, I'm going to look to recruit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2175)|
| 0:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| In that scenario, do you have tenant spaces ironed out that might be flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| some might want more, some might want less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| For LIVWRK, it would be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Well, in your shopping center scenario, you'd have areas designated for the business, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| They don't have anything designated for the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| It's strictly if a business, if a barber wanted to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| you'd have to get rid of the living room to set up a space for the barber chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| But I'm going to recruit a whole row of therapists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| That's my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Now what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| What equipment do you need as a therapist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| A couple of chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| I don't want to give them something to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Are these the same chairs that you're going to watch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| I don't even feel if it's a long session, so I need a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Typically businesses require some sort of specialized equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| Therapy chairs, I don't know, I don't go to a therapist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| but I'm imagining it's not the same style of chair that I'm going to watch the Tennessee football on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| on Saturday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| There's no to make it real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Do you see they're going to be good together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Sure, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| And I would expect my staff to look and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| there's an area in the front that's not dedicated towards the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| that they're going to dedicate towards the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| It's still integrated within the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| Could I interject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Mr. Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| So when that determination is made by plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| if the development team disagrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| they can make an appeal and say that this living room is designed for live work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| That's a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| There's a process for disagreeing with that interpretation, if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| I think the way that I've always understood live work is that there is enough space to have a work space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2309)|
| 0:38:41| as well as your living space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| And that could be completely separated, except through a hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| or maybe there's more open connection or maybe a wall or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| I think that if it looks like all of the other units in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| then that probably gives them a lot of reason to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| how is this different than all of the other units in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| So obviously we can't pick this apart or look at the design and try to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2345)|
| 0:39:14| But I think that if the applicant is presenting something and plans review says we don't see this as live work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2354)|
| 0:39:23| then there's a process for them to either make adjustments or make an appeal to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Well, and as you were sitting here going through it, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| I don't even know that 30 days would be enough to remove all the ambiguity of what I've just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| My concern is where you're going with your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| What the code says versus how you're interpreting it is left up to an individual to reinterpret what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2386)|
| 0:39:55| There's no firm understanding of what everybody would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| And the reason I say that, if we go with a therapist or they do an EMDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| if it's EMDR therapy, which is eye movement desensitization reprocessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| it's literally just a little unit with lights that the therapist has to have and a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| If this is trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, something different that they would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| But none of that's going to be shown up on plans or in the code because is that something we're trying to get so prescriptive in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2417)|
| 0:40:26| So I think what the gentleman talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| which is as long as we've got the ability later on to come back to retro this to storefronts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| if the market were so to go there, live work, it's not clearly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| It's not clearly defined in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| So now we're interpreting what we want it to be into the code, which, in my opinion, becomes very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| So all that being said, I'm now leaning the other direction of I think that this would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| based on all the contents, parking garage on one side, back of a theater on another, parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| There's already nobody down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| So if you can bring some people, Marble Alley, a great example, and set it up so that down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| if the market were to change, that you could convert it to full-on commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| I think that is achieving what Commissioner Higgins is talking about with a 24-hour city, but we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| So how do we make sure that when that time does come, it's easily convertible without having to tear down and start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| So I know I just talked in circles there because I feel like this whole thing is going down a drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| and we're all just caught in it right this second, but just listening to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| I have great concern that what the code says versus the interpretation of code are not matching up right this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| That's just gotten me with some great concern because now it's individual personal preferences over written policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2505)|
| 0:41:55| Thank you, and I think all these comments are worthy comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| We've got a light load today, so let's have good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| So Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| I do think it's really good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| I'm learning a lot, and it's interesting to see where people's perspectives are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| It's interesting to hear plans, reviews, concepts of what lived work could be, and your example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| because I think work has really changed a lot since that interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2541)|
| 0:42:29| We're over here brainstorming about the different kinds of work that we are familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| that that kind of layout would work just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| There would be absolutely no issue with it, and you wouldn't need to have super special equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| or any kind of layout that's different than what we've heard described to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| So I feel like, well, yes, there's a lot of ambiguity in that lived work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| That ambiguity may be there to speak to things are changing rapidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| and work does not look like a traditional office building that requires so many seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| and so much special equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| So that's the interesting academic part of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| But there's a case in front of us, and I really want something to be developed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| I feel like someone said there are no people down there, and that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| There are people down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Our downtown is going gangbusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| It's really wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| And I wouldn't even agree with the assessment of that being a C street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| It's one street off of the high A street, and I see so much potential there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| even with the challenges of a substation and these sort of dead zones of other parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| There's so much potential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| So I don't want to lock any of that potential out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| And that's why I think I keep thinking if we could just wait a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| I don't know if 30 days is the magic amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| but just to have a little more conversation to not shut down what seems to be a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| that's still getting figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| So I would be more inclined to have a brief postponement just to get a little more conversation had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| rather than just shut things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I always ask the question, what would you know in 30 days that you may not know today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Because we've got Mr. Aarons here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| I do not know what I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| But, I mean, we have Mr. Aarons here who I think answered some of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| But I respect that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| I think Commissioner Higgins had his light on before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| We'll go ahead and hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| I was wondering almost, and we're kind of getting off the subject a little bit about the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| and talking about, you know, the use in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| And I don't know if this is a question for Mr. Goss or the architect, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| to Commissioner Smith, you know, he said, okay, a commercial later, you know, residential now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| Is there a way or is there a threshold maybe that could be met to satisfy a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| Some design on that main level, if it's just, you know, one wall up and say, okay, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| this is the area that the business will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| You know, and it's on the plans, it's acceptable in, you know, a designated area that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| going for that could have the flexibility also if it doesn't work, it can be the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Does that make sense at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Peter, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| That's kind of what I was alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| We would look for some area that's dedicated to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| And Mr. Goss, if there's room on that main level, I mean, from an architectural standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| just on those main floors, is that something you guys could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| So I touched on it briefly, but one of the things that we are also doing is we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| shared suite offices, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| So I don't know if you've seen the plan, but on the corner is like a space ideal for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| coffee shop or a cafe or a wine bar or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Adjacent to that is our leasing, you know, office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| And then we have clubhouse and fitness and the things that, again, activate the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| people coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Adjacent to that is a shared suite office entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| And then we're doing offices that you can rent a single office around behind where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| residential units are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| These live works that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| And a shared conference room and business center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| So I understand what, you know, Mr. Aarons is saying about, hey, listen, these units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| really look like shotgun residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Well, they look like the units of Marble Alley Lofts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| But again, we've done the accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| They can be converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| And as I just mentioned, there are also these other spaces that are built into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| plan for those kinds of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| You know, business today is completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| You know, yes, somebody with a therapy business could open up shop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| But somebody with a graphic design business could open up shop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| And they could use the shared suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| They could say, listen, we also want to have this as an option for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Or you can do as I did when I was a young architect and I could meet in my living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| That's just the nature of that kind of service business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| And while we think of commercial and retail being, hey, Market Square where there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| shop, right, and there's a place where you can go in and buy candies or a new hat or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| whatever it is, that's not appropriate for every location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| All we can do is set up to make it appropriate whenever that market comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| But there are spaces within this property, Commissioner, you were, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| addressing your question, for those other kind of meeting spaces if these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| occupied by architects, graphic designers, therapists, whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| And I haven't seen the plans for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| But I guess I'm just trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| I mean, it's almost like we're saying can it be designed as residential and then be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| converted to commercial later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| What I was suggesting is almost the opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Could it be designed as commercial and converted to residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| Probably pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| You know, if we say, okay, live work and, you know, it's just to me it's almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| checking a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| You know, construction prices are through the roof and they're not coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| The cost of money is through the roof and it's not coming back soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| So being able to underwrite commercial as a potential income source today on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| street is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| So that's why we've chosen to do it the way we've done it, something that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| we can underwrite, we can price, and get funding for the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| I'm going to tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| We're expecting to at least put up 40% equity on this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| Not the old 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| It's a lot of cash that we're putting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| This is a $52 million deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| I'm going to rein this back in just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| I might have been the cause of this whole thing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| So remember we are, this is about a zoning, not about the economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| So let's continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| I want to clarify my suggestion of potentially postponing is more in thinking to give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| the opportunity to reassess the live-work scenario and hopefully withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| Because I don't see, I don't, one thing I really don't like when it comes to urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2967)|
| 0:49:36| planning is the idea of it's not, therefore it can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| And so to say that there's currently not storefronts on that street, therefore there can't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| is the kind of thinking that prohibits a lot of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| There's a lot of parking over there, a lot of visitors come to Knoxville, come downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| and park in that area and then have to walk through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| I've been a downtown resident for about a decade now, and I've walked and ran all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| these streets multiple, multiple times and seen how they've changed and seen what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| And really, I think that the intent behind the DKG zoning to require ground floor commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3014)|
| 0:50:25| of some sort is for the growth of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| It is, and whether that is just an office that has one person working in it and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| not going out and, like, it doesn't have to be retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| It just needs to be a mix of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| And so I have nothing against the live-work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| I think that it's pretty easy to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| You just make the unit a little bit bigger and have a dedicated area for work, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| at least that you can underwrite it as residential in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3055)|
| 0:51:04| And so I think that there's a clear path there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| And again, not to try to harp on the use that the specific applicant wants to do here, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| to talk about the intent of this zoning and whether it's appropriate or not for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| This is not, it doesn't meet the criteria for DKB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| And to change it so that they can have ground floor residential, I mean, let's just change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| it to IMU or RN7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| You know, let's just pick a zoning that allows for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| So the DKG zoning is intentionally placed, and back to the comment about setting a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| obviously I don't think that everyone that has property in the DKG is going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| requesting rezoning so they can put residential on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| But I do think that there are still a lot of unactivated large parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| You know, there was a mention of buying the parking garage across the street, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Let's put some retail down there and activate all of State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| So, you know, I think that there's, it's not a good direction for downtown to be, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| us to be moving to making rezonings like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| And I think that the DKG is the most appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| So I still can't agree with the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| Can I make a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I just wanted to point out that it's not just the zoning district that you have to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| with, but the zoning district also then leads to what the design guidelines recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| And the guidelines really don't lend themselves to this area at all, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| It talks, again, about buildings that are set back, and it has less discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| bringing the building forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I mean, they have a project they've already designed, so I'm not expecting a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| would change the design of their structure to any significant amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| But it does have more impact than just a rezoning to allow residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| It does also impact other things like the design guidelines and how we would review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| a project as it comes to the design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| There's also two different paths for non-residential use within a residential structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| One is the live-work that we've talked about, which is more of a hybrid commercial residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| space than a true residence itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| The other is home occupation within a residential dwelling unit, and that's not limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| just residences within a neighborhood that's a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| That just says use or activity carried out for economic gain by a resident conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| as an accessory use in a residence dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| So it's not, it could be an upper floor unit in the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| You could do a home occupation, but you're talking about a therapist, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| That's a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| You could do that in any residential unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| The only thing you can't do is change the exterior of your residential unit to look commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| You can't have more traffic to your residential unit than a typical residential unit would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| You can still have up to three outside employees come to your residence and work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| So when we talk about having non-residential uses within a residence, you know, think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3280)|
| 0:54:48| in that term, you know, a typical non-residential use within a house that no one would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| is there is home occupation, something that's obviously more intended for, you know, a commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3296)|
| 0:55:05| use where people interact more with that dwelling that's more of a live-work space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| So like, you know, an artist who has a studio, like an art gallery there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| So people come there and buy their artwork and so they have more of a storefront type space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| but they live in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Just a quick question, and I don't know if this is for planning staff or the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| Are the downstairs units or the floor units one or two bedrooms or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| I haven't seen the design plan, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| They're a single bedroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| And with code, do they have to have an outside entrance, like on the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| I literally have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| It requires exterior entrances that's so many feet along the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| So yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| Okay, so each downstairs unit would have an outside entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| It also has an interior access as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| So can I, I know this has gotten very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Unless you, would anyone like to address Mr. Busby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| Commissioner Schelza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Okay, I've been thinking about a test about live-work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| If you walk up to it, do you feel like you're creeping into someone's window that lives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| or do you feel like you're looking into a space that would welcome you and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| yes, come in, let's conduct some sort of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| And that's not the ultimate test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| but I think that's the intent of why this is codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| to not have residential in a downtown area because we want to continue to activate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| And so that's why I don't think it fits to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| So do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| I have another suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| I think we have a motion second, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Ms. Karen, do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Oh, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| There's not been a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| I think I heard someone make a second, but I don't think there was ever a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| So we need to be clear on the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| I suggested a postponement, but I don't think there was a final motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| So I'm just going to go ahead and make the motion to deny per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| We've got a motion to deny per staff recommendation by Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| We still have more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| So this is the only thing I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| One, this is to Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| When you said that you would look for something to figure out whether or not it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| was true live work, I want somebody to eventually define something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| because right now that's very ambiguous of what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| I think just having some very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| what's that something you would be looking for that would say this is true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| live work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| The second thing is if this motion succeeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| is live work allowed under the DKG as it would be proposed right now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3485)|
| 0:58:14| this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Based on the plan that was submitted to our office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| Did you mean G or did you mean the B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| It's currently DKG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| G, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Under DK, if nothing changes today, is live work allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Live work is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| What they proposed, we determined, was not live work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| And, again, that's where I want you to go back and define what that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| is so that they have a better understanding of what would be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| Because right now I've not heard any definitive, here's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| It's just a lot of interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| We need space dedicated for the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| because otherwise it becomes a home occupation where you're walking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| somebody's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| But is that the developer or is that me as the person who's going to own it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Because they're building up the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I could come in and put three desks in the space that's now true live work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| but that has nothing to do with the person building the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| So that's why I'm saying I need a definition of something to help guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| this, because there's just too much ambiguity in that right this second of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| what falls on the developer and what falls on me when I'm purchasing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| space to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I think that goes back to what Mr. Hill was talking about with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| He's got tenant spaces that are vacant that he's going to go and solicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| So if we looked at a plan and we saw the vacant tenant space that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| separate from the dwelling unit, we would be like, you're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| But what was presented to us was not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| It was walking into somebody's kitchen and living room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And I know that you can run a business out of your kitchen and living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| room, but that is the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| What is my title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| We've been here long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| I'm the zoning administrator at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I would interpret walking into somebody's kitchen and living room as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| being a home occupation versus walking into a space that is empty but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| dedicated for the business and it's separate from the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| And my concern is that's how you would interpret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| If I lined 10 people up, I could have 12 different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| So that's why it's just I'm looking for something more definitive because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| this is something we're going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| I think it goes back to presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I want to make sure that we do this right so that we're not having this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| but right now it's too much ambiguity in the whole thing for anybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| say this is what it needs to look like going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| So that's why I'm saying I need somebody to define something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| We will create a policy and put it on the web.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| I'm just going to say I think about so many examples like lovely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| brownstones, obviously a residential neighborhood with a little shingle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| hanging outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| And you know you're allowed to go into that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| that that space is a law office or a design agency or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| But you may be walking into someone's living room because that may be where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| But they've got a shingle and it's obviously a commercial sort of setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| And that's how I see that this block could really work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| And it seems like that is a live work example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| but it seems like there's some friction between the review and where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| We've got a motion to deny and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3724)|

| 1:02:29| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Item 8.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Eight nos, six yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| And chair will entertain any other motion or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3755)|
| 1:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| I'm going to make a motion that we postpone for 30 days because I really would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| get better clarification before we do anything else to have something defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| I don't think you're going to get any more than what he's already given you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| Well, he said they would write a policy and put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| You're going to write a policy that says exactly what you said, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| I'm going to confer with my legal counsel and create a policy that is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| As an attorney and as a legal counsel, I know when my business comes to me what exactly it is they're wanting me to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| So I'm not sure 30 days is going to give us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| But I do like discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| I like clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| And I do like to be able to rely on code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| And precedence does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Well, and 30 days is just what we're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| It doesn't mean that in 30 days the applicant couldn't ask for a further delay while they go back and fix some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Right now we're just delaying anything for 30 days for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| I started out encouraging discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| I'm not sure I'm still on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| So that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| So we have a motion to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| We have a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Did I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| So seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| And I also would like to say that because I thought about asking staff about this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| but there are implications with these zonings and how the design standards for the DRB are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3858)|
| 1:04:28| So I think that if we're going to postpone, it might be helpful if you all were able to give us a little bit of a bullet point list or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3868)|
| 1:04:39| summary, just so we all know why DKB only exists on boulevards and has different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| And DKG everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Seeing no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| So we're voting on to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| I think I heard three no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Did you get those, Ms. Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Could you raise your hands, please, the no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Boyer-Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Four no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Boyer-Browning, Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| Ms. Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| That would be 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3932)|
| 1:05:44| Ms. Karen, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Yeah, I would have motion carried 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| No, Boyer-Browning, Smith, and Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3948)|
| 1:05:58| I tell you, I want to give credit to whomever worked on these microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| I don't know if you've noticed the difference or not, but you can stand a foot away from them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| You don't have to swallow them to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Moving on to agenda item 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| This is going to require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| The applicant is Patrick Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| Location, east side of Island Home Pike, west of Mission Road, 1.37 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| Present plan designation zoning is ag, hillside protection, agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| Proposed designation zoning is low-density residential, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Existing land use, single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Density proposed, five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| Staff recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to the LDR land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| because it does not meet the land use location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| Motion number two, deny the planned residential zone because it is inconsistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| surrounding development and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| And I see the applicant is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| You can do either one as the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Well, given your instructions not to repeat anything submitted to the public record previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| I'll defer because my comments were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| And would you like to come up and state your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| My name is Barbara McDaniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| I live across the street from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| It's agricultural right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| We have a small farm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| I'm just wondering if it's rezoned, is it rezoned for the whole area or just that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| Just that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| And is this going to be rental homes or is it going to be sold to individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4086)|
| 1:08:15| So we haven't made a final determination on whether they'll be rental homes or sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Did you state your name and address, Mr. Hunt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| I'm sorry, Patrick Hunt, 603 Kennesaw Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| I'm the owner of 4424 Island Home Pike and the applicant for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| Ma'am, are you finished with your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| I just wanted to verify whether we're getting rental houses in this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| The area here is long-term homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| There's, you know, a lot of farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| Could we clarify that that's outside of the scope of our discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| It certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| The applicant may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| So, hi again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| I'm Patrick Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| I think I covered everything I really wanted to cover in the public comment that I made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| maybe even a little too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| But I would love to entertain any questions that you have about the intended use and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| Bear with me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| I'm going to get to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| And if you don't have any questions, I'd be happy to read my prepared remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| I saw this as being a bit of a unique case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| But let's go to Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| There's a few cases that follow 15 and 17 that say that PR is not appropriate for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| size lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| And I wanted to confirm what the appropriate lot size is for PR zoning and why the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| was encouraged to apply for PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| Ms. Hillman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| So, based on the concept that Mr. Hunt had, PR seemed like the most reasonable path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4203)|
| 1:10:15| with any rezoning conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| And I'm sorry if there was confusion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| We make it clear that there is no sure bet on a rezoning and it's something we discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| internally as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| But in terms of what he was looking to do, PR made the most sense as a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| And then with regards to parcel size, I don't know that there is an explicit...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| Well, there isn't an explicit minimum lot size, but considering the periphery boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| which is 35 feet standard, we look at practical considerations like that when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4246)|
| 1:10:55| what's buildable in terms of the intent of the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Further cases encourage RA or low-density residential instead of a hard denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| And I was wondering why that wasn't an approved recommendation for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4273)|
| 1:11:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| So, that would require low-density residential as a land use to be approved, which we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| not recommend approval for based on the location criteria and also breaking up that large swath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| of agricultural land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| But the RA zone is also...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| It doesn't allow for that flexibility in locating dwelling units in consideration of environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4303)|
| 1:11:52| factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| And considering the steep slopes on this parcel, I don't know that RA would really be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| PR takes into account environmental considerations like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| I, too, have just a little bit of a question as to why this shouldn't be considered at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| least somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| And I'm not advocating yet until I get some more clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| But as I look at this thing, you know, it's on a minor collector, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| In the staff notes, it says there's no sewer anywhere near this thing, but it also says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| that it's in the Knox Chapman water in the KUB sewer district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| So, I'm curious as to which it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Is it a sewer source, KUB, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| This...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| I mean, Mr. Hunt can speak to that more accurately, but it is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| The parcel's divided by those districts, so it's a little unclear which one would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| the provider, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| In his notes, he commented on having an agreement with both districts that KUB could extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| service to this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| And that's something he can speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| But in terms of the conditions that we can see in the maps and the existing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| there's not currently sewer at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| Yeah, so if I could clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| When I brought the property...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Mr. Hunt...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| I'm sorry to explain this, but I need to explain it because you guys would think I'm just out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| here being arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| But once it goes to commission, there's no mechanism to get you back involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| conversation unless you're addressed by one of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| I was addressed by Jesse, and I thought that was an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Then, I'm in, Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| So, when I bought the property in 2019, one of the first things I did was meet with KUB's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| new business team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| They visited the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| They contacted Knox Chapman Utility District, and the two of them agreed that KUB, at my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| expense, would run sewer to the property and that they would have dual service provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| in the area, which is apparently unusual, that Knox Chapman would continue to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| water service to the property in the same area that they do today, but that KUB would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| provide sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| So, I guess to continue my thought here, if we're on a minor collector, if we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| access to sewer, which the staff note says that there's nothing near it, but it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| like there could be accommodations with it, and if staff was going down a path of trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| to get away from the hillside piece and consolidate the area where you put the units, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4490)|
| 1:15:01| make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| And the other thing, you know, I'm not much of a golfer, but I think you probably hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| a sandwich and hit the city limit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| So, for it to be not necessarily close to LDR, which you can see on the map and close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| to the city limit line, on a minor collector with sewer access, you know, this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| where I would think that we would consider the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| But I'll wait for my other members here to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| I really appreciate Commissioner Eaton walking through this, because I see this as one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| those things that I think is happening more and more often, particularly in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| because we've got the urban wilderness and a lot of growth happening that is causing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| us to think about things differently and engage with different development ideas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| we haven't necessarily seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| So, when we get some of these more innovative projects, we're tasked with trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| out, okay, how can we make something work here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| So, thank you, Commissioner Eaton, for sort of walking that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| I hope that we can figure something out, because to me it seems like it's not a giant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4569)|
| 1:16:18| risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| It's a very small parcel of land, and we've got an applicant that's trying to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| due diligence at the outset to make some things work with the sewer system and that sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| And I'd like to just call your attention to where it says in here under the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| an obvious or significant error or omission of the plan is one of the requirements, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| it goes on to say it is noteworthy that the subject property's land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| of ag does not align with its location in the urban growth area of the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| And then it goes on to say the intent of the urban growth boundary designation includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| encouraging a reasonably compact pattern of development and offering a wide range of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| And then if you slide down about another sentence, sector plan goes on to say that agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| land use is generally not recommended in the county's planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| So, I think we've got kind of an imperfect situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| We might not be able to apply a completely perfect solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| It might require an imperfect solution for an imperfect problem that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| So, I would just ask you to consider that as we continue our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| Vice Chair Uten, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Well, I wanted to make sure I listened to Commissioner Adams before I did anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| I want to make sure that I didn't cut her off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| But hearing what she said, and I think what she said was absolutely appropriate, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| make a recommendation that we approve the LDR sector plan request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=4682)|

| 1:26:09| Staff recommendation, approve the planned residential zone with up to 4.5 dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the northwest county sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5169)|

| 1:26:38| Seeing no opposition, I think it's just going to be a simple math request today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| 4.91 gets us to 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| Staff had recommended 4.5, so 4.91 would get us 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| It's a difference of 1.3 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| I'd request 4.91 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5217)|
| 1:27:06| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| Commissioner Schell, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| As I inquired Tuesday about the adjacent property that can go potentially up to 12 units an acre, I think 4.91 would be accommodating, so I will make a motion to approve PR up to 4.91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5234)|
| 1:27:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5253)|

| 1:28:41| I see the applicant representative is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5321)|

| 1:28:46| Yes, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| This was before you a few months ago on five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| It was unanimously approved at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| The sector plan has since been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| It's now LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| The 4.5 is consistent with the low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| I know there were some comments posted online with some concerns about traffic and stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| I know there's plans ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| I think the county is in the process of acquiring some right-of-way to be able to improve the intersection between Fretz and Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| The timeline for that is that it should be completed hopefully the fall of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| But we appreciate staff's recommendation for 4.5, and we would ask that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Mr. Chair, I would like to make a motion that we approve the PR planned residential zone up to 4.5 to use per the acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5382)|
| 1:29:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| So we've got a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5391)|
| 1:29:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5404)|

| 1:30:07| Agenda Item 22, Applicant Edelmary Martinez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5407)|
| 1:30:19| Location, north and east sides of Brown Mountain Loop Road, east of Compton Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5419)|

| 1:30:28| 1.08 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| Present plan designation and zoning is agricultural, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| Proposed plan designation and zoning, rural residential and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Density proposed up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| This is going to require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| Staff recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to rural residential because it does not meet the criteria for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5451)|
| 1:30:59| And the second motion is to deny the planned residential zone because it is not consistent with the south county sector plan and it would allow development that may be out of character with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5459)|
| 1:31:13| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Representative of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| If you'll state your name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| My name is Andrew Henley, 304 Hermitage Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Thank you for your time, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| I'm speaking on behalf of Edelmary Martinez, my partner and the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| Neither of us are great at public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| She would have preferred to be here personally but unfortunately had to work so I drew the short straw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| I'd like to begin by correcting a small error on the plan amendment and rezoning report on page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| I may be misunderstanding what it's meant to imply but on the sewer source it's listed as Knoxville Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| There is currently no sewer source adjacent to that property within 140 feet in either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5518)|
| 1:32:05| The lot is less than a mile from Chapman Highway in a neighborhood, a relatively small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| You can see there on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| The properties that are nearby adjacent are all fairly old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| I think most of them were built in the 1950s and you can see from the map the lots are on average about a half an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| which was in line with the sector plan at that time, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| It was one half acre would allow for one density unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| This lot is 1.08 acres and is currently zoned ag, as you've already stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5556)|
| 1:32:45| There's also a few in the neighborhood that I clocked at about 0.48 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| It's right around there but the vast majority of them are just about a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| I'd also like to point out that there's a property address listed as 507 Brown Mountain Loop Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| but there is no structure on this property of any kind as it stands currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| We had actually planned to build a home and move there ourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| Unfortunately, that proved implausible due to some issues with the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| What we're planning on doing is we want to make it a buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| After purchasing the property, we soon realized it was not feasible to build there as it stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| due to the fact that it cannot be approved for traditional septic system like the other houses in the neighborhood have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| We now have to divide the lot into two half acre lots as well as finance a project to extend the KUB sewer line to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5613)|
| 1:33:41| thereby making it into two buildable lots that are more in line with the current character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| As you can see, most of the lots in that area are about that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| We would be doing the sewer extension at our own cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Based on our estimates from what we've had conversations with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| we anticipate it costing just in the neighborhood of $42,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| which simply isn't feasible for us to do it if we can only potentially build one house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| But if the lot were split into two half acre lots, again, in line with the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5652)|
| 1:34:19| that project becomes much more feasible and we could get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| I'd also like to point out to that end that there are plenty of properties in this neighborhood that were built at around the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| and frankly, the soil mapping is probably going to look pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| So a lot of the properties that currently have septic wouldn't have been approved if they had applied today like they were in 1955.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5672)|
| 1:34:43| So what we're really asking is to allow us to get in line with the neighborhood as it exists currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| As I understand, there are four conditions that must be met in order for that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| The proposed amendment shall be necessary because of substantially changed or changing conditions in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| in districts affected, or in the county generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| As was already stated in the report, there have been few significant changes to this area recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| However, there have been pretty drastic changes to the county generally, especially in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| I personally lived in South Knoxville for about 10 years and I never imagined we'd have a Starbucks, but here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| So the county is kind of changing around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| As a result of the increased housing prices and as well as the need for housing in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| South Knoxville is experiencing a population increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| This change in the landscape to the county generally reveals a need for both new construction and buildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| By allowing this relatively simple change to the zoning of this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| you would simultaneously open up space for Knoxvillians to own a home and allow us to bring KUB sewer to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5743)|
| 1:35:50| which will allow other homeowners who are already there to access it if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| The proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| Again, as was already mentioned in this report, all the other lots in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| with few exceptions, are already about half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| That would make them legal non-conforming lots, I believe is the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| Our proposed amendment would in no way adversely affect the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| and would, in fact, bring the lot more in line with the existing reality of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| The proposed amendment shall be consistent with and not conflict with the general plan of Knoxville-Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| including any of its elements, major road plans, land or use plans, community facilities plan, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| Through my research, I couldn't identify any such plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Mr. Hanley, if you wrap up, you're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5804)|
| 1:36:52| That's most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| Permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Mr. Rubin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| I think this one, to me, is a little bit of a different pendulum swing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| as the one that we just dealt with a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| You know, this is on a terminus of a small 12-foot road and very agricultural in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| and I think staff got this one right, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| I'll wait if anybody else has any other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| I'd like to make a motion that we deny the sector plan amendment to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| because it doesn't meet the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Oh, Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| We have a motion and a second to deny for staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| and we have Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| I just don't completely disagree, but I do think, contextually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| with the city slightly north there, city limits, and the way that's developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| I do think there's some contextual similarities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| but a bigger concern is something that the applicant mentioned regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| the ability to actually build on the lot with the septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| So did beyond, I don't think I saw it in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5898)|
| 1:38:26| but with the sewer versus septic, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| is there any considerations that could be made with their request in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| to the feasibility of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| That's a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| I'm not sure that I'm following your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| The applicant said that they pursued building a house on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| but the soil tests failed for the septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5934)|
| 1:39:01| And so in order to bring sewer to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| there's a lot of things preventing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| Is that possible to be within the consideration of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5949)|
| 1:39:15| the realm of the appropriateness of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| I don't think that's something that would change our recommendation, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| So we have a motion and a second to deny for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion we deny the PR plan residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| It wouldn't be consistent with the circuit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| So we've got a motion to deny a planned residential zone by Vice Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| Uten for staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=5999)|
| 1:40:08| Agenda item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Agenda item 26, Igor Chabon, Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| Location, northwest of Shod Road, southeast of Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| Approximate acreage, 7.357 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| That's an odd approximation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| Planned residential, existing land use is agricultural, forestry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| vacant land, proposed use, attached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| Number of lots, 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| This will require two variances, one alternative design standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6047)|
| 1:40:55| and let's see what else we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| And then the staff recommendations for the three motions would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| approve the variances and alternative design standard based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| justification provided by the applicant and recommendations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| Motion two, approve the concept plan subject to the noted seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| And motion three, approve the development plan for a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| subdivision with up to 33 attached houses on individual lots as shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| on the plan subject to the three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| And the applicant representative is standing before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for Igor Chabon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6112)|
| 1:42:05| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| My name is James Setzer, 6140 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6126)|
| 1:42:14| Mr. Setzer, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| The picture you had up there before of the apartments or whatever they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| the houses, I've seen two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| One of them, it got like an excess road because you got one road coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| from Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| And then it's got going out here and the one like dead end is going toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| Ball Road up toward the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| But then there's another plan that it's got the road going toward me on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| Which one of them is accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| Because I looked on the, you know, the website thing and showed both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| one case plan and another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| And I just wondered, yeah, that's the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| And I just wondered, you know, what are they planning on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| dead ends of my property out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| They ain't planning on coming on my property with a road or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| You know, I just wanted to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| And like I say, all that on my side over there, I got woods right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| So it is going to be blocking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Are they going to interfere with any of my woods right there when they build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| I don't know nothing about the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| I don't really know what they mean by a buffer because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| I ain't never met the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Nobody's come to talk to me about nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| Let's see if Mr. Reynolds can satisfy your questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| The plan that we see on the screen is the most current version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| with the right-of-way going to the east towards your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| They will not be extending anything onto your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| They should not be grading onto your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| or clearing anything on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| It does allow for a connection if your property was ever to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| if you or somebody else did, then somebody could connect to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| But it is there for future use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| but it will not extend onto your property without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| I know there's two creeks that come across there and join on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| They did have come across, put a sewer line on me just to get to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| because they built a subdivision on this side before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| and now they're doing it over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| And when they dug it on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| they hit an underground spring right before they get to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| It's leaking all over me now, so I don't know how that ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| it's always been soggy, you know, out through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| And the way the creeks, I've seen the creeks up over five foot before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| you know, a big storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| I didn't know if all this, how it's going to affect the water coming on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| and flooding me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| So that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| Mr. Gard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6282)|
| 1:44:55| My name's Dan Gard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| I live at 3304 Lowe Bay Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| My family has lived out there for 68 years on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| We run cattle on the property that they're wanting to develop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| So I'm very aware of what that property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| and I've showed pictures of how wet that property gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| usually about eight months out of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Right now it's very, very dry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| and so they've just now in the last week done their geoservices water thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| So it's not nowhere close to accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| I talked to my son that's 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| He said, I asked him, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| have you ever seen that creek over there as dry as it is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| And he played in it as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| He's 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| He said, I never remember it that low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| So that's a very wet property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| The water comes down Lowe Bay Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| and with the new road construction and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| it's still coming across about the center of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| and runs toward the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| and finds its way into those creeks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| You put 33 apartment buildings over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| with four or five feet in between them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| 10 feet, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| it's going to block the water flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| from where it naturally goes into that creek that it's went for all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| The road coming in on Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| it's right-hand turn in, right-hand turn out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| with a medium out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| I think it's a 75-degree turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| which that would be coming in from the left-hand side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| You come in and turn going to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| and work your way down the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| So we've already had a delivery person out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| that's lost his legs in the last two or three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| because of all the subdivisions on the west side of Lowe Bay Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| that they said that they was not going to allow any building on Lowe Bay Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| until the new road was complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| and that's in your minutes from previous meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| I said something to Mike Reynolds about that the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| and he wasn't aware that they had built any more property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| houses on, actually, the Lowe Bay Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| He said it was contained to 30 houses in Carricade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| It's already up to 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| The builder told me, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| I can start 30 houses in Lowe Betty Landing, which is just across the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| and there are already 80 families living in it, and the road's not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| I was promised my driveway would be out for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| It's been out for 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| and they still can't tell me what they're going to do with the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| because it's going to come in my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| So there's too many things going on on the properties out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| The planning commission says they want diversity out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| When we moved out there, there was 10 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Now there's thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| There's a mile and a half from Lowe Betty Road to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| There's thousands of houses, and they just keep on adding more and more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| and now they're wanting to build apartments out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| We don't need any more diversity out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| We've had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6494)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| These aren't apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| These are attached townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| So there's 33 of them on 7.357 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6510)|
| 1:48:38| We have a stormwater engineer, Mr. Harvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| The stub out they were talking about, that was condition number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| We had a stub out going to the north in our original plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| and Mr. Reynolds asked if we could instead find a stub out to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| Of course, that's just a stub out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| It could be there until the cows come home, as they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| or until that property's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| If that property's never developed, then it's just a road to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| But it was a condition for approval that staff placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| and we were able to accommodate that on our site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| We're going to have to address any of the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| We do know there's creeks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| There's a creek termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| There's stream buffers that we'll have to respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| and that's reflected on the plans that are before you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| One of the conditions is that there be no building permits issued on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| property until Shod Road is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| And that's building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| It's still grade, but we couldn't pull any building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| I don't know what's going on with the other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| I wasn't involved in those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| The project before you now, though, the condition of approval is that no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| building permits be issued until Shod Road is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| And, of course, this is part of the Shod Road extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| where our only access is onto Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| We're not going to be accessing Labette or Ball directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| So all of the traffic generated from this is going to be handled by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| new, you know, four-lane median highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| Mr. Gard, you know, I think he mentioned something about his trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| and the trees is something that the landscaping, the buffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| is something that is also conditioned for the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| And that is on condition three for the approval of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| It says the existing healthy trees along these shared boundaries must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| maintained and may count toward the required landscaping screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| And the landscaping screening that is recommended in condition three is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| type C landscape screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| I've had some conversations with Mr. Reynolds about that condition and would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| like for this commission to consider making a slight modification for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| If you look at the plan that's in front of you, the southwest corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| you know, we're going to have to do some grading and rerouting of some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| the water that comes across the property line there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| and it's going to get pretty close to that boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| It is our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Every developer would like to keep as many existing trees as possible because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| they would count towards their screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| And it's our intent to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| There's a row of evergreen trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| I don't know if they're cedar or exactly what type of trees they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| but it's right along the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| It's even hard to see it on that map because the yellow line kind of draws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| it right through where the trees are actually located on the west side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| If you scroll up between Mr. Gard's properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| I think he and his family own all the properties moving up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| most of them up on Libetti Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| In the event that because of our grading, some of the roots get damaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| or we have to take one of those trees down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| what we would like to propose is that we replace that area with a type B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| landscape buffer, which is more intensive than the type C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| We don't want to take any trees down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| It's our intent to try to save them, but sometimes a tree does get damaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| or injured along the way, and so we'd like to even increase the buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| above what staff has recommended for that screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| to go at least in that area if a tree is removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| make that a type B screening instead of a type C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| So I would ask that that modification for the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| condition number three, be modified respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| and ask that you approve this first task recommendation otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6751)|
| 1:52:40| Okay, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| Yeah, I guess I had a question for the civil engineer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| I'm just looking because, Mr. Garth, somebody had passed around, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| some photos of some drainage issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| So where exactly are those compared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| I guess it's actually from the west boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| The water will cross anywhere from the north boundary where your arrow's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| anywhere from there up into the first two cedar trees up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| It crosses between the two cedar trees and works its way to the ditch line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| so you're talking 300 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| And you had mentioned, I guess, before, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| that there might be some runoff coming from Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Is that right, coming towards your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| I've talked to the guy that's over the project out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6812)|
| 1:53:40| He says as of right now he don't know what he's going to do with the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| that runs down Low Betty Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| He says, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| Every time right now, of course, I've got a temporary driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| but every time I get a good rain they have to come out and repair my driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| because it's washed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| And I've seen water between the two cedar trees up at the top of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| four to six feet wide where it rains hard and runs down through that field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| across into that creek, and it just crosses at various places through that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| So if you're going to put up your apartment buildings along the west side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| where's the water going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| I think you might be ultimately dealing with two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Maybe defer to Director Snowden about Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| when it would be completed and maybe some of that water is a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| controlled than it is when it's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| It's not controlling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| They're saying that the curbs on Low Betty, on the new portion of Low Betty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| where they widened it on my property, it used to be a wagon trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6881)|
| 1:54:50| And over the years changed these, which all of them haven't been changed since 1948,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| but they allowed the subdivisions, the Carricade and the others, to come in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| widen the road on my property, and just said, I went to their meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| and they said, well, if you want to do anything about it, you have to take a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| And that's come from the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| So they pretty well do as they please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| So I guess, too, though, where your house is situated, if I'm reading this topography right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6917)|
| 1:55:25| just like Shod Road is above Ball Road, your property sits pretty high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| All downhill from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| Like 45 degrees that was supposed to be mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| It was supposed to be under 30 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| They still can't tell you what the elevation is truly being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| Even after they've done all the grading work, they still don't know exactly what they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| according to Blalock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Yeah, it sits below Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| I mean, you're at an elevation of about 1,072.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| It looks like you might be at an elevation of 1,072.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| And then going down Lobetti Road, it goes down from you from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| Yeah, it's all the way down to Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| So you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| So you're above a lot of that, where that stream is coming through at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| My house is above that stream at the very bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| That stream kind of goes cat-a-corner from one corner of that property to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| And that's about a third to half the way up there, the property that they're wanting to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| Over there about where you see the tree line on the east side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| So it runs cat-a-corner across that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| Yeah, and by looking at the plan, it does, as Mr. Mullins had pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| it looks like the civil engineer has taken into account the stream that's down through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| and designed around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| You can see the stream buffers that are on either side of it to account for all that runoff down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| But again, I think you're kind of dealing with two different issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| maybe a road that's under construction right now with the county might be coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| No, I'm saying whether they had the new road, the new shod road or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| the water still comes down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| And some of it goes around back to the east side of my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| around the back of the garage and gets on the property they're wanting to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| Some comes around the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| Some comes down the driveway and goes down the middle of my pasture field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| and drains over into their property into that creek at various places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| Mr. Snowden, does your department have any comment about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| I'm trying to get the plans pulled up to see where our catch basins and curb and gutter are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| So just give me one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| So I'd like to talk to Mr. Harbin then, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| Your curb and gutter goes down to almost where the barn is at, is where it stops at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7062)|
| 1:57:51| So Mr. Harbin, if you'll take us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| Yeah, just so from a water perspective of this subdivision of this concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| I guess is what I'm trying to get at with respect to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| I don't think any of this is draining back towards his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| We'll have absolutely minimal impact to Mr. Gard's house or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| And this whole thing, he is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| It is sort of alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| If you see the design there, we've got a preliminary grading plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| We've actually raised the side about four or five feet everywhere around through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| so we can be up above where the creek elevations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| So ultimately, yeah, the development of this and the approval of this will not negatively affect this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| Have minimal impact, if any, at all on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| Mike, this is your case, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| The applicant was asking for a change to the third condition about the tree line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| And if I heard him correctly, he was saying that he wanted that condition changed from type C to type B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7129)|
| 1:58:57| So he was asking for the way the condition reads right now is to maintain the existing trees along the boundary line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7137)|
| 1:59:05| which the existing trees are pretty like they have a bit of a distributed layout to them right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| so they're not tied against each other creating a perfect screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| So the condition was to basically install some new trees in a distributed manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7154)|
| 1:59:21| like they can use the existing ones to supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| What he's asking for is that they feel that during the grading activities and as it did to the final design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| they may not be able to keep all the trees, but where they cannot keep the trees or something happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7171)|
| 1:59:36| and they have to take out one, that they'll put in a type B screen, which is actually a better, has more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7176)|
| 1:59:44| So they'll be putting more trees in than the current condition in the areas that they do remove some of the existing trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7184)|
| 1:59:53| So type B is a better screening than C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| Type B will end up with trees that are tighter that create a perfect screen between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| The trees will theoretically grow together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and this is more of just a question as I'm looking at the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| I see one-car garages, and if I'm looking at the scaling correct, based on what you've presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7216)|
| 2:00:25| where's the extra cars supposed to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| Because the driveways don't look long enough to hold the cars, based on what I'm looking at here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| without parking on the sidewalk, which would prohibit walking on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| So I'm just curious where the extra vehicles would go in this concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| I was confirming with Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| He said there was a 20-foot setback and there wouldn't be room to park there in the front within that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7247)|
| 2:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| And, again, just look at page 10, because as I look at the car as it's put on here with the scaling compared to the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| they just don't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| That's why I'm asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Yes, that's just a different scale drawing right there, that turning radius that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7265)|
| 2:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| So there is 20 feet between the property line and the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| There's also another 12 feet between the actual road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| So you have 12 feet from the road to the property line and then 20 feet on to the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| So that's 32 feet between the road and the building front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| Just another clarification for Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| On that request for the Class B buffer versus the Class C buffer, is that for the entirety of the project or just in certain areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| No, that's if we can't keep some trees, we have to take some trees back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| Instead of replacing that tree with a Type C buffer, we would replace it in that area with a Type B buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| so we'd actually be increasing the density of the landscaping in any area where we had to take a tree down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| So that's still for the whole thing, but just in the event you have to take one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| The recommendation is a Type C buffer for where it abuts residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| but if we have to take a tree down, we would replace it with a denser Type B buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7338)|
| 2:02:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| I don't know who to address this question to, but it's about how the tree issues when you're grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| and doing things, how that actually plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| I don't think it's for you, the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| I think it's for someone else who can answer how this tends to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| So if you have a tree line that's designated, it's protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| and how do you make sure that it's not an applicant just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| huh, it would be a lot easier to cut these down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| How do you manage that so that it is genuinely like, yikes, we made a mistake, we hit the roots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7372)|
| 2:02:59| and now we're going to have to do this as opposed to just ease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| So typically on the plans, there's limits of disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| and usually there's an offset between the existing trees and limits of disturbance for their grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7387)|
| 2:03:15| In some cases, the tree roots extend further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| so they end up taking that tree out and then replacing it with new vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| So it's really just up to the discretion of the applicant then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| Well, there can be on the plan shown an existing vegetation buffer shown on the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7410)|
| 2:03:37| which they aren't supposed to disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| But in some cases, the grading contractor gets a little bit outside the limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| and they'll have to replace that vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| Amanda, could you just introduce yourself for the commission so everyone knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| Amanda Perkey, Knox County Stormwater Land Development Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| And just a question, pardon the ignorance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| so I'm looking more to the permits department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| If we approve this, how does number three get triggered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| So let's say we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| Two weeks from now, somebody walks in to pick up building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| How is that stopped so that we don't have somebody start building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| Is there a system that triggers you all with an alert after we pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| We can put a note on the file, and this is on, I think it's PR as well, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7471)|
| 2:04:38| Is this on PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| Before we can issue a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| we would consult with Mike or someone on staff at planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| to ensure that that met the intent of the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| So we would have a note on the file in the code's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7490)|
| 2:04:58| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| I've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7503)|
| 2:05:04| I'll just go ahead and make a motion to approve the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| and alternative design standards based on the justification provided by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| applicant and recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| We have a motion to approve the variances and alternative design standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| for staff recommendation by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| seconded by Commissioner Levenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| Chair, you need to make a comment about the one variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| that they wanted to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| Yeah, that's in number three, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| Yeah, number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Yeah, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| Never wrong to be too cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| Okay, so we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7552)|

| 2:05:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Chair will entertain a motion on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| I move that we approve per staff recommendation the concept plan subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| to the seven conditions listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| We've got a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the seven noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| conditions by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Levenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| Seeing no other lights but Commissioner Smith, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| I'll make a motion to approve the development plan for a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| subdivision with up to 33 attached houses on individual lots as shown on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| the plan subject to the three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| And are you going to make that modification on item number three from type C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| to type B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| With the modification of number three being provided that a type B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| landscape screening, da, da, da, da.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| We've got a comment from Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| I think just to make sure we're on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| the request was that type B be substituted if the existing trees had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7616)|
| 2:07:02| removed for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| That was what we asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| It's type C if we can keep the existing trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| If we take a tree down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| the request was we replace that area with a type B buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7629)|
| 2:07:16| If needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| If the trees come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| It was very important for the neighbor that we keep the existing trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| and that is our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| Ms. Karen, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| Yes, Mr. Chair, I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| I make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| I was just going to suggest maybe we add a line to number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| You know, if we just kept it like it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| except maybe added something like along at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| lessons in the event existing healthy trees along the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| the West and North boundaries of the site outside of the 50 foot stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| buffer are removed by applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| Applicant agrees to install a type B buffer to replace them in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7676)|
| 2:08:03| Are you okay to amend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| We'll give Ms. Karen just a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| You got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7693)|
| 2:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| So we have a motion to approve the development plan for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| subdivision up to 33 attached houses on individual lots as shown on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| plan subject to the three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| And the third condition was modified with adding a last sentence that Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7708)|
| 2:08:35| Karen has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| Do you want to recite it or do we run with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Everybody knows what we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| So we're going to substitute type B if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7725)|

| 2:09:09| I didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| There wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7750)|

| 2:09:29| Existing land use, single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| Proposed use, duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| Density proposed, 5.17 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| The staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| approve the request for one duplex on lots two and three only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| Two duplexes total, subject to the noted ten conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| Here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| Seeing we have a couple of folks to speak in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Forester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| I'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| Taylor Forester, 1111 North North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| Here on behalf of the applicant for the proposed request of the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| duplexes on three individual separate lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| This one is, kind of took me a little while to work through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| and I've talked to planning staff about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| and as far as the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| kind of the leading basis of the staff recommendation is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| assertion that we exceed the low-density residential sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| designation of five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| So, understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| Normally, you see that with plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| where you're having a plan residential up to a certain amount of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| per acre, but not exceeding five in the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| And the sector plan limitation on the density really doesn't apply here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| because what we have here is either already in the process or will be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| the process of subdividing this parcel into three separate tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| And so, with it being the RA zoning and what we're trying to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| with the duplexes on lot one, lot two, lot three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| the minimum lot size requirement is 12,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| Each individual lot meets that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| Therefore, when you're subdividing and you subdivide them into separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| parcels, you're really no longer tied to that mass total land original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| parcel with the up to five units per acre restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| And kind of a further way to think about this is, to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| is if we just come through with, I believe it's lot two and lot three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| that they've recommended that the duplexes be approved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| Let's say we just came through with lots two and lots three for a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| right now, and we transfer or sell lot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| And then in December, the new owner comes through and requests a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| The analysis of the sector plan of the amount up to units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| wouldn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| It would just be an individual lot, as these will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| The original design shows for lot one an access off an existing easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| My understanding is that was originally staff's request that that access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| be from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| But noted in the staff report is if a duplex is approved for that lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| that that lot should share the existing or the to-be-constructed driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| easement that we have for lot two and lot three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| And completely fine to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| We agree with that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| And so that would, as staff noted in its report, for lot one there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| you would shift the proposed location or layout of that unit to face the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7973)|
| 2:13:00| other two units on two and three to where they do share that to-be-constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| access driveway easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| We do have that access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| It's recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| It's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| These, if you scroll to the plans, these are very functional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| very good layouts, units, two stories, garage, three-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=7998)|
| 2:13:25| And I may be the first one to say it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| I didn't think I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| This is exactly the missing middle that we keep talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| You know, at the end of the agenda, I thought that word was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| hit so hard by the time we got there, but I don't believe it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| But this is in the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| This is kind of right outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| It's a good opportunity to provide housing for six different families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| These are good-looking units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| They're going to fit within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| With the urban growth boundary, it encourages reasonably compact pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| of development, promotes expansion of the Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| economy, and offers a wide range of housing choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| We submit that that is what this does, brings in some density into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8043)|
| 2:14:10| urban growth boundary to provide some affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| With that, we'd ask that you approve the proposed use on review for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| duplex on lots one, two, and three with the conditions as listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8060)|
| 2:14:26| I think it's the nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| I think those would still apply with that request, and we'd ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| those be part of the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8074)|
| 2:14:41| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8081)|
| 2:14:48| My name is Wendy Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| I am the property owner of 2336, where all three of these duplexes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| going to be completely around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| I was looking on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| Am I talking too loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| I feel like I'm really talking loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| I was looking last night, and I would just like to go over the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| recommendations and then the comments to make sure that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| correctly what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| Number two, it kind of looks to me like lots two and three are kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| approved, right, and they will have only access through that SPAE or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| that S-P-A-E or whatever, which is the easement that does not concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8120)|
| 2:15:26| mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| If lot one is approved, also would only have access through the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8128)|
| 2:15:35| easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| I had a question about number five because it said something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| providing access to the SPAE from my easement, which is that very long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| one that goes right there in front of lot one, but it says that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| need to obtain a waiver to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| It also said in number six that there would be no access between my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| driveway and the SPAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| And then in the comments section, it said that if it was a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| family home in lot one, I have a question, then will they be using my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| And then also down at the bottom that it said that there would be only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| 76 daily trips, which in number six it said would not draw additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8179)|
| 2:16:25| traffic through the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| So my question is, how does 76 additional trips not draw additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8188)|
| 2:16:35| traffic to that very small residential area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| Also, the property line between lot one, three, and then back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8198)|
| 2:16:49| behind lot three, there's a split rail fence that I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| It's kind of like the makeshift property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| The one in which there's a lot of greenery and shrubbery that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| growing up through that split rail fence, and I'd also like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| sure that that will absolutely not be touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8230)|

| 2:17:24| I've lived there for 53 years, and I used to own this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8244)|
| 2:17:30| I sold it to my neighbor who has since died, and I did give him the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| easement to that property for a trailer that my mother lived in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| which is still there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| It's being occupied by I think they're workers that have moved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8262)|
| 2:17:48| and that's who they sold the residence, Kenny Trapp residence to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| and that's the one where they're trying to get the easement through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| My question is if they're putting an easement in and it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| 25 feet, bringing utilities and sewer, why use Wendy's driveway at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8283)|
| 2:18:11| Because you're going to be bringing in sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| You have to bring in everything through that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| Why bring it up through hers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Presently, there's no water, there's no sewer on her driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| and it has a very steep hill at the end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| which you can't even turn out of it without dragging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| So if people are going to live in that house, they're going to drag every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| and that driveway is only 12 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| There's no passing whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| Someone's going to have to back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| So if you add more dwellings up there, you're going to add traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| Now there's a trailer there, which is being occupied by the workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| and they're making it as a U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| They've already used it for construction into lot one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| to move some dirt down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| That area is probably a 30-degree angle ditch, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8345)|
| 2:19:12| Where's the water going to go that runs off all these houses onto her property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8352)|
| 2:19:18| There's no way to stop it, especially the roofs and driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| the asphalt and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| Like she said, you're going to add 72 vehicles to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| I think when this survey and so forth was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| they didn't realize the Alcoa Highway was going to be chained so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| They're less than a half a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| UT has opened up over 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| The only way to get to Chapman Highway is by way of this road or one more road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| So we've got over 300 more vehicles that travel that road daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| and it's only 16 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| So I'm against it because you're creating a great hazard with that traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| because the road is only 16 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| In the house across the street, there's a cedar tree that stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| I mean, the school bus barely makes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| So if you add this traffic and construction, it's going to be a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| Thank you, Mr. Kirkland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| Just a brief response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| I think kind of the, I guess, primary objection seemed to be the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| of the existing driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| And again, with the request of the three duplexes on the three separate lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8436)|
| 2:20:42| we would use what is shown as the hash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| the easement that is not an existing full driveway at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| The driveway that isn't existing is the one listed as existing easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| So again, with the three duplexes on the three separate lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| they would all be served by the to-be-constructed driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| So you're not going to use that other right-of-way at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| For the duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| And Mike, if you're going to have duplexes, it seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8476)|
| 2:21:26| and you're going to huddle them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| and your intention is to be neighbor-friendly as far as buffers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| Yeah, landscape screening, kind of the evergreen screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| Why would we not have three duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| Oh, in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| I mentioned that the three duplexes goes over the low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8504)|
| 2:21:50| maximum density of five dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| I'm not also wild on having the duplex between the two single-family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| but that's why my recommendation was to allow the duplexes on the two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8520)|
| 2:22:07| lots two and three, that are not between the two single-family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| But the main reason is the density going over five dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| My question is if they were to cut that lot out, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| and someone else were to buy it at a later time with two duplexes be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8542)|
| 2:22:27| would we look at that to be approved for a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| That's hard to say how we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| I think we would kind of know that we see one application today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| and then we see another application tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| and then another application the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| It's a unified development in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| and that's how we're looking at this as one development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8566)|
| 2:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| I'd just like to add a little bit to what Mr. Reynolds said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| When we're looking at a use-on-review, Commissioner Levinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| you asked some really good questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| We're looking at Section 6.50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| and it directly points us to make sure that anything that we recommend approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| for is in compliance with adopted sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| and so that's why we end up looking back at what the allowable density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8593)|
| 2:23:19| I just want to provide that additional clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| Commissioner Barger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| I just need a little clarification also because of what Commissioner Levinson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| Based on the site plan, Lot 1 is using the easement that they have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8608)|
| 2:23:35| but Lots 2 and 3 are using the new easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| Why would Lot 1 not use the new easement, or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| That's what I'm confused about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8622)|
| 2:23:49| Is that a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| So when we originally submitted for Amy, Cheryl, 902 North Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8631)|
| 2:23:57| when we originally submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| we actually did have all the units coming off the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| and then at one point there was a request from staff to that particular lot use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| the existing easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| and then there was some sort of change back the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| Our preference would be to come off of the same driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| The one you're currently using or the new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| The new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| I mean, I think that's the path of least resistance for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| and creates the best situation for our neighbors as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| I don't know if there was a miscommunication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| but I don't know why we would necessarily request that Lot 1 come off of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| existing driveway and not the SPAE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| but we probably didn't say you couldn't because it already has access to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| We just didn't want additional lots coming off of that driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| We couldn't allow additional lots coming off of that driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| I think bottom line is that's the way we originally did show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| It showed different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8696)|
| 2:24:57| We're happy for them all to come off the central new easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| I move that we approve the request for a duplex on Lots 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| 2, and 3 subject to the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| We've got a motion by Commissioner Schelso to approve one duplex on Lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8721)|
| 2:25:30| 1, one duplex on Lot 2, and one duplex on Lot 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8730)|
| 2:25:35| subject to the 10 noted conditions and seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8735)|
| 2:25:42| Commissioner Levinson, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8742)|
| 2:25:50| You got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| I just thought you might have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| Commissioner Hill, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| For the first time, I don't have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| Isn't Schelso's motion different than what staff has recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230914?start=8763)|
