| 0:00:00| We're going back into session. It is 347. Clerk, if you would read the next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| On page 6, Resolution 901 is a resolution approving an economic impact submitted by the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:16| in connection with the multi-use development adjacent to Everett Road and El Camino Drive in Knox County to be known as Deer Park Business Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:23| Do we have a motion? Motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=23)|
| 0:00:26| Motion has been made and seconded. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to ask a few questions and discuss this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=31)|
| 0:00:45| I guess the first questions are for Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| Todd Napier, Development Corporation of Knox County. 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:59| Todd, in the process of the IDB and its review and recommendations, there were a few things that stood out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=59)|
| 0:01:12| Could you tell me a little bit about the economic impact study in relation to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:21| The economic impact plan that was submitted by the Industrial Development Board that you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| Sure. Basically, it's the mechanism that allows for the increment to flow back to pay for public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:40| It goes through and describes the project and the expected benefits when the project develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| It then defines the improvements that would happen. I don't know if you had any specific questions related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=108)|
| 0:02:02| One part related to it, there's a third party review of that study, isn't there? A company from Franklin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=122)|
| 0:02:13| Okay. You're talking about back, not the economic impact plan, you're talking about his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| I'm going to back up. So that's like one step before when the application review committee looks at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| What we do is we have a firm called NextGen that we've used a couple times out of Franklin and Chicago to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=148)|
| 0:02:38| and to give us some sense of what kind of questions might we need to ask, what kind of questions or concerns do you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| And so we use those and that information is forwarded on to the application review committee and ultimately to the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| So when NextGen took a look at the project, I mean, one consideration is just, is this as it was proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=173)|
| 0:03:04| is this an economically viable project? And so what did NextGen have to say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:12| I'll have to look and see if I have the exact comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Some of their concerns were that there was not a market study to validate whether or not there was actually a market for these types of needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:25| And then, you know, then whether the project could actually create, ultimately came down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| can the project actually create the increment that's projected then to be able to cover the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=211)|
| 0:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| Were there, do you know if Mr. Maddox had any substantive letters of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=226)|
| 0:03:55| or commitments from potential buyers or banks or financing for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:07| For financing pieces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| He does not have a letter that was presented to us on financing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| Okay. Do we have any proof of interest from a buyer or from a leasee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:25| What we provided and what the IDB had was some letters, one from a hotelier that said that we had some interest in the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:34| but we really wouldn't explore it further until some road improvements were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| And there was one from an adjacent property owner that has a residing business there that basically similar concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| If I started with questions about road improvements, would it be you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Would you be the best one to discuss that with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Are you talking about like engineering aspects of road improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Well, just fundamentally some of the changes, I mean, the real proof for the need for the TIF is that these road improvements benefit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:16| public as opposed to benefiting the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| So there's some, I mean, when I'm looking at the road improvements as I see them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| I think it benefits ingress, egress for the development, but I don't see the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| I don't see how those changes are benefiting the public definitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| I can tell you, and I think that Mr. Maddox or somebody from his group of folks here ought to speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| but what was presented to us is primarily based on the improvements from the interstate all the way out to Buttermilk Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| and then some improvements to El Camino Drive, which obviously the biggest and largest user of that road would be this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| So I think I'll stop with that and then maybe let Mr. Maddox speak and then I can answer anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:18| Okay, yeah, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Mr. Maddox, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| Steve Maddox, Everett Road, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| As we have pretty much gone over, I think, since the very beginning, these roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| all the roads out there in that area are in very poor condition, very narrow, two lanes with a lot of heavy use by trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| and then a lot of use from everybody that enters or exits from the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:52| This road will be the new entrance, because of the difference in the way the road will be designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| will be the new entrance into the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| You have, like, from the Pellissippi Parkway south down to Hardin Valley School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| that type of road is what we're looking at building here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| and this one would be the other entrance on the southwest end of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| And then at some point, those two roads will join, which will make a very usable thoroughfare all through Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| and it's opening up that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Now, the other big advance for that area are the water for fire flow and just the need for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:40| And then also, one of the other areas that's held up development in that area has been sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| and we are contributing heavily to the sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Well, I just want to stick with the roads for the moment right now, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| They actually all work together, pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| But within, and Dwight might want to weigh in on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| these road improvements aren't in our capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Like, even in the top 15 or 20 items, these particular roads within the county are not in a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:16| anywhere in the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Is that not true, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=499)|
| 0:08:27| I don't think there are any near-term plans to try to improve these roads with local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Well, that's the point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| When you're tiffing something, it's got to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| the sniff test is public benefit versus the developer's benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| I think if you take a careful look at this, Mr. Maddox is the one that's going to benefit from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| This is different from the town center, quite a bit different, I think, from the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| I'm speaking to the board now that we have a source of revenue in the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| This is a, to me, and I think I know where this is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| but to me this is a site, first of all, that Mr. Maddox purchased under duress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:19| The site was under duress, apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I can't find out who made the hillside cut, and I've been looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| I've been looking for weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| And back to 2001, at least, one of the people on the deed in 2001 named Waller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| and it was still a hillside, a forested hillside at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Now, I think this is a stretch from an economic development standpoint for the use of a TIF, absolutely a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=584)|
| 0:10:00| We see, and you read in the paper, financing institutions are running from risk in commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:08| I don't see how anybody, when they look at this, as Mr. Maddox proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| this is hotel, motels, restaurants, and retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| and that hillside's looked like that for a long time, and it's been ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| But we're willing to go ahead and TIF it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| I think it's a bad site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| I think it's a bad plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| I think it's a bad deal for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| And there's been significant opposed positions in its review, and I suggest we deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:53| May I answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| First off, obviously the development gains value by having the roads and the utilities expanded and improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=656)|
| 0:11:09| But the county and the citizens also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| It's a 50-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| It's a good deal for both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Secondly, that hill was not purchased under distress or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:23| We paid a market value for it at that point in time, but it was already a borrow pit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| I did purchase one track from Mr. Waller, but it was a borrow pit at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| What we've done is gone in there and improved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| And then regarding that the hill has looked like that for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| we just finished those last set of pads up there just not even hardly a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| and we've got the final phase of the development to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| which we wanted to make sure we had the road improvements before we went ahead and invested that in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| But it's a good site, and we're getting a lot of interest, and we do have interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=715)|
| 0:12:06| Well, since you bring that back up, the site, and I visited the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| I'd never seen it from but one side, from the I-40 side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| Did you excavate the backside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| When did your excavation of the backside of the site start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:31| Well, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| It would have been about 2007, 2006 or 2007, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| And I remember in terms of the excavation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| have you been able to recover some of your costs in terms of selling off the soil, selling off the dirt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:55| There was an excess of soil on the property, and so we have sold some, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| What were your plans on the backside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| I know you had the retail, hotel, motel thing on the front, but what was the backside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| One thing that keeps being discussed is that it's purely as a retail, hotel, restaurant site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| The backside is primarily designed for what we call flex park or business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| which would be a lot of businesses that are like office showroom, office warehouse type businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| small retailers, wholesalers, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| So the design of the site is to take the, as the top is leveled off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:46| the dirt is stair-stepped down the backside to look very similar to the front side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| I just, you know, again, Mr. Max, I appreciate your work and what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| and possibly it's a good thing at some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| But given this timing and, of course, what I consider the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| it's just not appropriate for the kinds of things that you think you're suggesting should take place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| And the first time I heard it a couple of months ago, I suggested to you some other ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| and I don't think those fit very well with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| It's just one of these places that maybe at some time this might be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| and some time in the future we might be able to tiff this with a good conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| But at this time, until it pinks up and gets a pulse or something from a financial standpoint, I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| I guess I've seen projects that pass the but-for test better than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| But I'm all right on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| I respect Tony's arguments and his point of view, and Commissioner McKenzie about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| I don't know if it was, I think we earlier talked about public transportation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| Obviously, that's just to throw a rock in your Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| If you know how CAT works, it's not how much they make, it's how little they lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| They recover about 12 cents on a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| If they sent a bus out there, they'd be lucky to get a penny on the dollar back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| I'm getting off the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| I think Pellissippi State is not that far away, and the center of population of Knox County is not really that far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| It is way out there, but there's a lot of people living in Loudoun County and working in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Again, to what some things Tony said, if the bank won't buy the bond, then the TIF doesn't happen, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| I mean, if the bank's not going to step in there and loan you the money by buying the bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| then the TIF's never going to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I mean, this is a tough environment, a tough economy, and I admire you for trying to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| and I will admire First Tennessee or whoever it is that buys the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| I hope they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| And if it does pass, I've had a couple of calls from, I won't use the guy's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| I assume he's called some of my colleagues, has a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Actually, it's a truck wash close by, and I'd just like to give you his name and just keep him posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:36| If he's worried about his business and if he's worried about failing and worried about the dust and all the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| he may have talked to you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| But I would like to have you stay in touch with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Actually, it's a lessee of the building there, and I know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| And then the owner is also one that has put the property into part of the TIF area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| I go this area to get to a little farm I go to in Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| I go down Watt Road about once a month, so I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| I've seen it for years, and I'm like some of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| I don't know when it got desecrated like that or destroyed like that up on the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| but it's in terrible condition now, and your plans look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| I mean, again, it's a tough market for retail, tough market for offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| but I applaud your efforts and I hope you are successful both with the financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| and then with the hopefully the economic recovery can help straighten all that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| and can maybe put that, rejuvenize that whole area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Todd, I seem too happy to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| I'm thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| I bet you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Again, what was the time limit that you placed on this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| It kind of speaks to a lot of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| It's approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| It will be three years from today at which they have to be entered into a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| and financing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| To enter a development and financing agreement means you've got the money in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and technically then the IDB borrows the money guaranteed by the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| no recourse to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| And if there is not a development and financing agreement three years from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| then the TIF will expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| The other time limit that's in place is five minutes, excuse me, five years from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| If the improvements are not made and completed and signed off by the respective utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| and public works, then the TIF would also go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| So what does that mean, the TIF goes away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| They'll start realizing some of those dollars in the interim, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| The way we've set up these TIFs is the work has to be complete before the increment is released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| And that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| As I said earlier, I say good luck with this property for a lot of the reasons Commissioner Norman pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| I think this is going to be a tough sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| You don't have a letter yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Good luck getting one in this environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| They're going to really sharpen their pencils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| The location is great in terms of where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| But it's a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| And I do think, again, I am going to support this one strictly because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| if anything in that area is depressed with the way, you know, the property as you received it, that this one probably is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| So I say good luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| But, you know, I'm not extremely hopeful unless things turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| But I am going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| I just want to, you know, I guess when Tony Norman speaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| it's a little like when E.F. Hutton speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Everybody listens because of his reputation for honesty and sometimes bluntness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| And I mean that in a very positive way, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| But I would like to just address some of the points he's made because there's been a misconception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| and sometimes on TIFs, and I'm not speaking about this TIF in particular as I start what I'm going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| but I will come to it specifically later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| is that, you know, I think the comment was made that whether we decide on a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:39| or not is whether it benefits the citizens of Knox County more than it does a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| where really I think the standard for a TIF would be whether the project would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| or would not go forward but for, and it's sort of the but for test on a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| And then also the way that the Knox County taxpayer does benefit from this is that there will be tax revenues from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| We do have, you know, we do have jobs and we do have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| other benefits that do benefit the Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| And then also we, you know, also we have this issue about is it taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:25| and it is not taxpayer dollars that pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| As we've mentioned, it's the two people that are on the line for this are the developer and the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| The developer ultimately is going to have to pay that bond off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| and if for some reason he defaults at some place along the line, it's the bank that loses the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| And there may be some who feel that it's the Knox County taxpayer, and that's absolutely not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| Another reason that I think that we should support this is purely for environmental and aesthetic reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| And I think Commissioner Shouse used the word, the desecration of the land out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| I mean, you know, quite frankly, that's a big word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| I'll just use the word it's a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| And until something's done out there, that's not going to get cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| It will just sit there as a continued eyesore and really is no benefit to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| As far as the type of jobs, I mentioned this at the Monday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| I know there's been concern that these are not high-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| And I know from the report that the Industrial Development Corporation gave to the Developmental Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| they don't necessarily like to spend a lot of time evaluating these type of TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| because the jobs that are generated are not the higher-paying, higher-skilled jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| But we do have a need for jobs like this in the county, the retail-type jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| I mentioned on Monday that we do have elderly people who've seen their 401Ks tank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| and they need the additional income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| It's the type of jobs that grandma and grandpa can work at to supplement their income, both for income reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| and also for social reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| We have college students that can take jobs out there to help pay for their college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| I believe that UT just raised their tuition 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| This gives them an opportunity to work at a job, either part-time or during the summers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| to allow them to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| And then Commissioner Hammond made mention that for a project of this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| we have a lot of construction workers who right now aren't doing a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| that this will give them something to do to build out this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| And then finally, the benefit to the taxpayers directly is that it was estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| that this will bring in $10 to $11 million in sales tax and property tax revenues eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| And I will like to mention, even though the TIF is paid off by the incremental taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| the county does see an immediate benefit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Not all the money goes to paying off the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Part of that does come back to the county and to taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| And just after the spirited debate that we had over the $8,000 on that grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| and we had our whole lunch today was maybe not the whole thing at lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| but a lot of our lunchtime was dealing with ways to finance the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| to see if we can do anything to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| We had a long laundry list of things that were cut this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| If we had an additional $10 to $12 million in the county coffers to spend on some of these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:37| I think everybody would be pleased and benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| And so I think really if you weigh the positives, which I've just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| and really there's not a whole lot of negatives to the county and to their citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| because we're not on the line for any money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| And I include in that just the eyesore that's out there right now in weighing the benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| and the potential negatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| I think that the benefits potentially outweigh by far the negatives, and I think we should support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1513)|

| 0:25:23| On page seven, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:32| Resolution requesting that Knox County Audit Committee direct the Knox County Internal Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| to conduct a forensic audit of the public billing authority of the county of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| and the city of Knoxville from 2005 to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| I want to recognize Commissioner Wombe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Yes, I'm going to make a substitute motion on this to change the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| Oh, just change the wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I think you're just doing a verbiage amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| I'm going to change the wording, take out forensic and put in material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| It means the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| A lot of people have concerns about forensic being negative and like we know that there's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| I do not know that there's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| I have no proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| But if we change it to material audit of the public billing authority of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| and the city of Knoxville PBA from 2005 to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| So that's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1598)|

| 0:26:42| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Resolution 906 is a resolution requesting that Knox County Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| direct the Knox County Internal Auditor to conduct a forensic audit of the financial aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| that led to the construction of the Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| as well as the management of the project through completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| included but not limited to an examination of the involvement of members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| employees of the Knox County Board of Education in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Commissioner Wemby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| I'm going to change the wording from forensic to material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| and I'm going to spell out what I'm looking for in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| and that is the processes and the procedures, the steps that were taken from start to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| when we first started talking about it until it completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| and thereafter any change of orders and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| And that's what material I think will capture because that's going to put it all in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| That's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Motion and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1664)|

| 0:27:46| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Resolution ratifying the rules promulgated by the Knox County Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| relative to a process by which employees, taxpayers, or other citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| may confidentially report illegal, improper, wasteful, or fraudulent activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1675)|

| 0:28:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Commissioner Wright or Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| This is our hotline that we've been working on for many months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| and I see somebody's got a poster that's appeared around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Commissioner Wright's got a poster that calls have been coming in quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| and that's a poster that has been put together by the hotline guru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| He needs to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Anyway, I think we're ready to put it into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| I know Commissioner Burroughs has had some concerns in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| with there being some excessive calling in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| and it could be used to smear somebody in a campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| and I understand those things, but I'm ready to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| unless we have some great reasons not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| What was finally decided about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Well, Commissioner, what we were trying to do under the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| basically the way our policy reads is following state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| and it's basically an unfunded state mandate from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| that's never been analyzed or interpreted by the Attorney General or state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| I was hoping to get some information from the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| to see if there was some way we could ensure it isn't abused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| and thus far I haven't been successful, but I'm going to keep trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| I think that's where we are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| But policy as written conforms with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Well, we probably should just go ahead and pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| but I think that's something that the Audit Committee is going to have to continue to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| because there is some really great possibility of misuse with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:53| So I think that as long as the Audit Committee will keep moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| and trying to get a resolution to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| then I don't have a problem with going ahead and passing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1807)|

| 0:30:30| Commissioner Briggs, you had said that you wanted everybody to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| I'm assuming everyone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| The mayor's office and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| So is there a motion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| That was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| I believe the question was, has the school board signed off on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| You know, I was in error last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| It was on the last school commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| It was actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| They had signed off on it last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| and I believe that it's been on their agenda and they're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| If you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I remember is that the law director had to step outside for just a moment to take a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| but that's all been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1872)|

| 0:31:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| I guess I'm going to solicit some help from the body here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| about where to go with this line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| I think that ultimately what I'd like to do, and this may be a very good deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| I mean obviously from the sale price and the appraisal and all that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| so it may be very good for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| But what I think has happened is in our rush to achieve some other goals related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:34| of course, to Carter and all these other things that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| that a process possibly has been, a thorough process has not taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| I'm not sure we've done a real close financial analysis of what we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| I mean in the auction process of auctioning off this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| And so that's what I suppose I'm asking from the body is where have we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| are we sure about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Have we covered everything that we should cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| And so that's where I'm going with my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| And I've got two aspects or two areas that I'm questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| Of course, one of the areas is the fact that we've sold a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| And so when I asked that question at our workshop meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| there was some curious kind of vagueness about, well, is this a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| Is it not a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Well, it's a park according to the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| It's a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| It says Bigfoot Mountain Bike Park, Knox County Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:54| with a sign that's about four by three or four by four or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| It's a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| It's a passive park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| It's not a park that's being funded well or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| and I think we've got some kind of agreement with some other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| But it's a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Now in my process, and maybe I'm not a, I don't know how I fit into the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| but I never heard any discussion of the selling of a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| And so that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| And then if you combine that with a couple of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| MPC was asked, I believe, to participate in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| and in doing some part of the study, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| highest and best use of the land that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| I mean, I was all for, you know, with all the problems with the mulch facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| we could debate about its benefit to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| operating expenses versus profit sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| which I think we got close to $90,000 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So anyway, with the financials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I think there's questions about the financials from the standpoint of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| well, we've gotten things kind of straightened out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| We're not in the same situation we were a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| And I just think the study, I think some kind of study needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| to give us a comfort level with this before we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| And again, it may be a really good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| But I am concerned about the park thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| So I guess, first of all, that's the direction of the questions to Doug Battelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| is probably to the parks issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:51| So is it a park? Is it not a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| And if it was a park, Doug, in the appraisal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| what was that park worth as compared to the parcel that contains the mulch facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| Yes, sir. Doug Battelle, Senior Director of Parks and Recreation, Knox County Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And I guess, yeah, there's been some question about was it a park or was it not a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| And in our park inventory, we list over 40 properties of which some we own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| and some we lease and some we have use agreements with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| This property was obviously purchased just as a recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| And as it was a large piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| and only so much of it was flat enough to be used for a recycling center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| we looked at other uses since it was a county property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| and were able to put some mountain bike trails on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| So it was never really purchased as a park per se, but it had a park use to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Again, we have several other park properties that we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| short or long-term lease agreements on it that we could lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| and others that we'll probably have for a very long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| because of deed restrictions on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| So again, it was listed in our park inventory and was certainly up to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| It was never a high-use park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| And I think one of our thoughts there was we put in some trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| They never really took off, mainly because right across the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| you have one of the largest mountain bike areas in the whole area in Hall Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| So that really was the main use part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| So we had a very small user group here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| So it wasn't a park that had much of a budget at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| and it wasn't a park that had much of a user group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| in terms of folks coming out on a daily basis and really utilizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| So again, we were sort of a piggyback use on a county property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| that had more than one use, which is not untypical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| We have several properties like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Okay, do you know anything about the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Was there a request for MPC to participate in something prior to the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| to give us some guidance in terms of how we possibly could use this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| I was not involved with any of those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I'm going to have to defer to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| John, you're moving around a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Does that mean you're ready to answer that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| I can respond to part of that, but you do have a representative of MPC here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| I think what the request was, it was sort of a bit nebulous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| but it was a request to get advice with respect to the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| and best use of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| consistent with the concern of Commissioner Briggs about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| and or potential rezoning and parceling this property in some fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| to make it perhaps more desirable for sale purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| and achieve the highest price in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| And the county through the administration level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| and I don't know whether they talked with MPC or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| I know that I had conversations with county representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| I also had a number of conversations with MPC about the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| and best use of the property and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| And I would suggest that there was probably input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| although I wasn't personally involved in any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| But what really happened was that ultimately this body called upon the county mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:26| to, in essence, give this body advice on what they thought was the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| and what the highest and best use of the property was and the best way to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| And what came back from them was to sell it as a whole, to sell it as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| with the current zoning on it, with the expectation that a portion of the property was appraised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| valuing it by the acre for an industrial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| and a portion was valued as residential use by the acre to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| Could you put some numbers on those portions, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Could you put some numbers on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| You don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| It was in the appraisal that came out to be 1.19 million that you all had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| And I want to point out also that from day one the subject has always been how best to sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:25| and how to go about it and at the same time consider whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| or not you were going to sell it all or sell parcels, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| There were a number of things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| The county went through a process of trying to see whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| or not they could continue to own the property, have it utilized in a different fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| That was determined not to be feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| And then you got the report back that, as I said, said it should be sold at public auction, sold as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| And ultimately that's what was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Well, I guess that's where I feel like I'm left out here or I missed something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| because I never participated in any discussion of selling anything but the mulch facility as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| And then when the auction was formalized, then I saw the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| And then I saw, you know, and then there was notification it was a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| And so I was like, well, I mean, I'm completely missing a whole bunch of this sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| And so that's what's disturbing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| Well, you know, and if that's an issue with members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| I don't want to pass it off as insignificant or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| but certainly if that's an issue, that would be an issue with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| because from the start, once the decision was made to sell the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2512)|
| 0:42:00| then the decision became we want to sell the whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| All of those people involved and those a number of whom showed up at the auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| I assume everybody did their due diligence as did my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| And it was very clear that the entirety of the property, 159 point something acres was what was being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:25| The county got a title commitment, had a title search done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| got a title commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| My client did likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| And the entirety of the property was determined, in essence, it was owned by Knox County unencumbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| There weren't any restrictions on its use except for those matters of public record in the register of deeds office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| that have to do with things like utility easements and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| And it was, you know, advertised to sell the whole properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| And that's pretty much what was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| And I think, you know, as part of that, I know I talked to county representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| I talked to Mr. Battelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I remember two specific times talking to him about this idea about a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| And essentially the county expressed and had no interest in trying to operate a park there of any consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:21| And I don't think I'm misinterpreting what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| But that seemed to be pretty much where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| The last point I'd make is we've come a long way in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| And I understand you think maybe it was hurried somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| But I would suggest to you it's really been going on for almost a year, getting to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:53| I agree with the mulch facility part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| It's just this other part that's a new component that's just brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| I mean, that's a matter of a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| It hasn't been a matter of a few months, at least for those of us who had interest in pursuing possible acquisitions of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:12| I know I have had a number of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| I know other people have done likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| I have pursued the subject of whether this is or isn't a county park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| And it's essentially what the county has told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| We're going to sell the whole property and, you know, you buy the whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| And that's the basis on which the auction was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:41| One last point is I want everybody to be comfortable with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| but I also think I'm pretty much obliged to make a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| If for some reason we get to this point now and we have gone through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| and we've had an auction and we've had the identity of the high bidder determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| and what that amount is, if this doesn't go forward, I don't really want to discuss the sort of the list of horror stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:22| that follow from that as to what occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| It's not really a subject matter that is of need to discuss at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| but there would be rather substantial consequence to back up, if you will, now and not go forward with approving the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| Oh, well, my suggestion would be to continue the contract as is, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| and allow NRT to go ahead with their business as they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| I certainly wouldn't want to interrupt the business process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| And I understand and I appreciate that attitude, but that hasn't been a subject of discussion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| And we've discussed extensions before and there are those at least I believe I detect correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| there are members of this body who don't really want to see a long-term sort of an extension and keep this continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:13| There have been other people at this podium who voiced serious objection to a 30-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| which is what we're operating under right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| I would just say to you that in a final analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| if there is a body of interest on the part of someone to come forward to propose a utilization of a portion of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:40| for some sort of a park, they can talk to us as well as they can talk to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| But I just say to you that it was the sale went forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Once the determination was to sell it as a whole, it went forward to be sold as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| And there was no, if you will, any kind of restrictions on the use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| other than whatever the zoning classification is and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| And, you know, we all did our due diligence on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| And I would hope that you don't further postpone this action, even if it were to include an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:25| I would respectfully suggest and urge that you go ahead and approve the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| You know, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Okay, you made your point, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Can I get to another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| It's not for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| I just wanted to ask Mark Donaldson right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| If you were in the loop, if you were in the loop or you weren't in the loop, if you were in the loop, how were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| What happened in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| And I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Mark Donaldson, the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| I know that early on the draft of the resolution that you ultimately considered included MPC amongst the list of departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:11| and agencies to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| By the time you got that on your agenda, MPC had been eliminated from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| We collectively as a planning staff haven't looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| but I'm sure that John has talked to individuals of our staff about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| How were you eliminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| How do we eliminate you in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| How do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| All I can say is that the initial draft of the resolution included MPC on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| and the draft that was ultimately considered by the body did not have MPC on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2929)|
| 0:49:00| I don't know how that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| So, anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| And my proposal is, again, just as I mentioned at the first, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| That's an interesting revelation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| I don't know how that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| My question is, I don't know if it's to Dean or John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| but what are the plans for these dollars that we'll realize, the $2 million from the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:41| General fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:57| In the short term, the money would be deposited into the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| and then in order to do anything besides that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| it would take a vote of this body to dedicate that to another purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| So we could pay it toward our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| So that, how would that come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Being quite honest, I've heard a couple of things I'm not too comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| Would that come as a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Will we slot it in, the line item transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| That's a significant sum of money, so I'm just trying to get a feel for what we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| I think a resolution would be the most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| So what we're saying then is that what we thought we all had agreed to was not what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| in terms of including MPC and what we thought we had been presented with to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:58| Actually, today turns out to be something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| I think I'm detecting a pattern, and I'm not happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:12| I'll also say that, I mean, I've been very much in favor of selling the Solway property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| I don't think we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| We certainly don't need to be in the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| I support getting out of that 100 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| and selling this property so that someone can make good use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| But I'm really concerned to find out now that there are Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| who are using part of it as a mountain bike trail area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| So that changes my thinking on this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I wish that was information we had had earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| I would support Tony's – did you make that as a substitute mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| I have no idea what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Well, I would like to know more about this area that's being used as a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3119)|
| 0:52:09| how much use it's getting, all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| before we decide as a body to sell it off to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| So I would like time to get that information together before making a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| Mr. VandeVeet, do you wish to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Mr. Chairman, if I could, I hope I could clarify a little bit of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| The role of MPC for highest and best use came into discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| as a consequence of an original resolution proposed by Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| that contemplated the possible rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Over the months that this has been under discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| the possibility of rezoning the property pre-sale was eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| I believe on the recommendation of purchasing and potentially the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| the possibility of rezoning property prior to the sale was eventually eliminated from the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:10| And as a consequence of that, MPC was no longer engaged in the capacity of evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| the potential highest and best use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| I actually don't know if all of you have had the benefit of a copy of the appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| but the appraisal itself does speak very clearly to highest and best use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| And the appraisal itself does document the existence of the park up to and including photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| So perhaps we should have made certain that everybody had a copy of the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| That's a purchasing matter, and I'm not entirely clear on the process there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| But the appraisal is comprehensive. It is detailed. It does speak to highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| It does contemplate the existence of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| It includes, it goes so far as to include photographs of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| So for those of you that did have the benefit of a copy of the appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| during the period of time that this has been under discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| I hope that none of this comes as any surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Regarding highest and best use of the property, the appraisal clearly says that there are 20 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| that are suitable for commercial slash industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| That's the portion that's similarly used at present by Mr. King's client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| The remaining 139 acres is described as sloping to extremely steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| and is suitable for agricultural or rural residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| Extremely low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| That's on page 32 of the appraisal, and I'd be glad to share that with anybody if you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| I believe we've looked at this for as long as I've been a member of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| whether or not we should be involved in the mulch operation business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| And for the last several months, I think we've been involved in trying to get out of the mulch business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| to the extent that we wanted to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| I'm somewhat confounded by the fact that we're now talking about a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| There are lots of places, I guess, as the director of parks and recs has pointed out to us, that we have dual use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| We have walking trails on this piece of property we own or we lease or we borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| But in this particular instance, we had a lot of acreage with its prime use as a mulching facility for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:53| And I guess I could say as a twofer, we then had a bike trail, which I missed the name of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3353)|
| 0:56:04| but there's a really important part that I remember out of it, and it was Bigfoot's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| Bigfoot was a World War II vet across the street that made a kabillion bucks in the auto salvage business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:19| That would be my, I think, humorous connection of why this trail off-road for bike riders might have been called Bigfoot's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:32| Sort of lets you know that I might have a memory of where I used to go with my dad looking for junk truck parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:41| The MPC being brought into this, I thought we had an at length discussion about what we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:51| what Dr. Briggs brought about how we could get the most money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission may have pointed out to us that we were not the client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| that the client was not here to ask what they wanted to have approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| We don't say what people are going to do with property in Knox County until they come and ask us most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3425)|
| 0:57:14| And that's the situation that we're going to be faced with in the future or maybe right now, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| These people are in the ag zone doing a mulch business, which is probably appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| But in response to Dr. Briggs' question, the MPC, about whether or not we should be rezoning or redoing anything there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:37| I guess we relied on the fact that, well, no one was asking for anything to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| and we just don't willy-nilly go changing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| And I think one of the things that's been covered is the financials of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| I believe it was appraised at a certain value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| We could have a lot more than that invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| I believe the thought of the day would be that it would bring a million and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| and it wasn't long until the five or six representatives of the administration that were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| started dancing when the bid passed maybe $1,700,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:21| and one bidder was bidding in $50,000 increments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| and the other bidder was bidding in $100,000 increments, and then an auction took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| You only had to have two people interested, and one, the current owner, excuse me, the prospective owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| and the other bidder brought it to whatever market was going to bear that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| Which brings me to what I think to be my last point was, or is, I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:53| I made a point that based on the most time being taken up in front of the county commission for the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| has probably been green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| I wanted to see the excitement or lack thereof, what might have taken place that day of that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I saw what took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| And then, Honorable Mr. King, and I might disagree on some points, but it's just going to be fine points here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:25| and I'm not an expert, so he can be the ruling authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| This was an auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| I don't believe the word absolute was given, so that doesn't really mean that it was sold that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| But what I do remember being announced was pending the outcome of tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| That means we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| That's what was advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| That may be what he's going to rely on from that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| I don't think we can go until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| I think it's got to be right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Well, you know, whenever we get through talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| The sale that day was approved pending what we do approve or disapprove this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| So there's never a late date on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| There's always time to talk about things, and this is the time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| It's just that I think that some of the things that we're looking at right now may be kind of away from where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| The property brought more in bid value than we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| We started out wanting to get rid of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| and I think this evening that we need to move along and approve this sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Dwight mentioned what I was going to mention a while ago as far as my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| As far as the MPC and BOMA, that was early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| But at the time we got down to the vote to sell it, that was not part of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| So I think we can disregard that because that was not part of it at the time we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| I was wondering, is there any way to get around this by having any kind of restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:18| or allowance in the contract that that part could still be used as park space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:29| I know that when homeowners are often asked to grant easements for the creation of greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:37| could something similar be done in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| Mr. Jarrett is shaking his head no, but I'll let him answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| No, I can understand the sentiment, but the sale has to be as stated during the sale process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| You can't subsequently modify the terms and conditions of the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| or put restrictions on the property that could nullify the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| I think for clarity I probably need to offer a substitute motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| So my substitute motion will be to defer this for an undesignated amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| until financial consideration, thorough financial study could be made of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:20| And so that will be my motion for the people that, you know, so basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| Can I ask a point of order, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Leaving the date open leaves it open, but you say a financial study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| What are you looking for in that study is I guess my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Well, something in terms of a comparison of the appraisal, I think it would be difficult to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3756)|
| 1:02:46| I'm not sure about the selling price now that went into auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| but I wish that hadn't taken place really so that we could be objective about operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3770)|
| 1:03:02| revenues, the profit sharing arrangement that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Just an analysis, just a businessman's look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| Is this the appropriate thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| In other words, staying in the business currently as we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Yes, staying in it as we are, looking at what we've done in the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| and project into the future given the business as it is and our arrangement within our RT as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| So that would be the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| So for the body, you know, if you think that that's been thoroughly vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:41| and you agree that you're okay with the selling of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| I think you would vote against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| So the motion on the floor is to delay it for an undesignated amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| until thorough financial consideration is given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| Commissioner Burrell seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Again, of course, you know, we weren't involved in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| but I just want to make sure you're not doing anything to affect this sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| You know, you start leaving it open-ended like this, you could technically kill this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| I mean, that's your call, but, I mean, you need to do it eyes wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| This could, depending on the bid specs and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| there's closure dates that are going to be asserted when deed has to transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| and if you interfere with that, you could run the risk of nullifying the sale, just so you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| Well, that's the purpose of the business analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| If the business analysis lends itself to this is not such a good deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| and maybe we ought to stay in it, that's why I want to do the business analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| No, I'm just, what I'm saying, I haven't seen all the closing documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| but what I'm getting at is if there is a time frame, oftentimes in these deals of sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| it says if deed isn't transferred within X amount of days, the sale is nullified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| Okay, well, and I'm not trying to jeopardize the deal by putting some kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:13| projecting this out into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Is something like a 30-day, would a 30-day time limit be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| And would it be injurious to the prospects of the closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| It's closing the barn door after the horse is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| This should have been done before, and we voted to sell the piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| It's been sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Now we've got to either approve the contract or not approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| I guess I'm asking that of probably of Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| Do you know anything about the stipulations for the closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| I recall the terms and conditions of the sale were that the auction is going to be conducted on a specified date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| specified time at the site, and that the, of course, there was a premium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| buyer's premium added for the purpose of the fee to the auctioneer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| The auction was conducted, and all of the terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| and all the information said that it was subject to approval by this body on this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:24| I have to confess, while I have probably at least part of the day had occasion to think about some of the consequences of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:34| not going forward, I probably haven't thought of all of them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| I do have a number of thoughts about the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| What about the 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| What about 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Well, let me add to that is right now we're operating under a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| That 30-day extension expires in August, at the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| You don't have before you anything that permits or this body that has approved that permits an extension beyond that 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4017)|
| 1:07:10| and the potential for an additional 30 days at the discretion of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:20| If you put this off 30 days, we'll be sitting here four or five days before the end of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| once again not knowing what our position is about whether we have to get off the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| or whether we can stay on it, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| I would just urge this body not to go there, just to let this take its course, and that course being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:45| you have to have at least recognized that the decision was made by the appropriate persons in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:57| that are supposed to make decisions initially about buying and selling a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| And it came before this body as a discussion more than once as to how it was to be accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| and what the timetable was for getting it done and the consequent timetables of other parties in interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| as well as the interest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| The decision was made as to how it was to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| I would respectfully suggest that by far the better thing to do at this point is to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:33| and not run the risk that you run off $2 million on a piece of property that was appraised by one appraiser at 1.19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:44| based on the assumption that 20 acres of it could be rezoned to industrial, i.e., the highest possible value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:52| that could be put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| And I respectfully suggest that this body ought to go ahead at this point, approve the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| and let us move on with the business of business and you all move on with the business of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| The maker of the motion would like to amend that wording to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| Amy, do you read the 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| My question is directed at the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| Based on the discussions that have taken place here with this legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| we made a decision to go in a certain direction and retained an agent to act on our behalf at the sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:56| And I heard with my own ears that the announcement that day would take precedent over anything that had been offered prior to the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4196)|
| 1:10:07| And at that moment, the full faith in whatever of Knox County was placed on the line for someone to purchase that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:18| and for that contract that was made that day between our agent and the highest bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:32| to be either approved or denied on this date certain in this legislative body's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:42| So whether we approve the sale or deny the sale, I would think a 30-day extension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:52| or trying to extend this date of dealing with this yes or no of the sale to some future date probably would not be a legal motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4252)|
| 1:11:07| Well, I think the concern, you know, whether or not, you know, the motion itself is legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| I think the effect would be that you could end up being in a breach of contract situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| and you could put this sale in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| So, you know, and considering the fact that you've got someone that needs to vacate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| the purchaser obviously wants to move on the property and delaying it, I think it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| I mean, just from the terms of breach of contract scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| So in other words, I agree with your analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| I would like to offer that the person who won the auction offered considerably more than the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:54| That means they want this property badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| They want to continue in the business that they're in badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| And I see that they see value on this other land for things that are far different from parkland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| And we've been a little bit negligent in terms of how we are stewarding that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:20| That's the reason for a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| You know, again, Commissioners, this is purely a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| I'm not trying to assess the property or what the future use would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| or whether or not it ultimately should be one zoning or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| What I'm telling you is that generally when you consummate a sale, you put the sale in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| If you do anything contrary to that sale, which was to bid it, accept the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| and then start your contract negotiations and have the current tenant vacate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| But, again, you've got to, you know, nothing, you know, perhaps it's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| You may make it continue, continue for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| The buyers and the seller may have no issues whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| But it's just tenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| Motion on the floor is to delay for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Original motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| I've already made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| The motion has already been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Commissioner Norman votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| This is a resolution approving a procreation in the amount of $4,325| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| from the risk management fund balance for the purpose of reimbursing Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| for reasonable attorney fees incurred while successfully defending the compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| before the Knox County Ethics Committee Resolution 912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| I guess a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| I thought I got an e-mail from the law director saying that we should wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| I guess maybe I misread that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| My concern was that passing this prior to enacting your ordinance could nullify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| So the way this resolution reads, it won't become effective unless and until you pass your ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| which permits it, because right now the whole reason for an ordinance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| because currently there is no legislative ability to accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| This resolution is legally sufficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| albeit payment can't be made until the ordinance becomes effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| One recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| This is a resolution that was added, Resolution 913,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| requesting that the Knox County Mayor consider ensuring that when future vacancies arise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4492)|
| 1:15:00| on the Metropolitan Planning Commission, all parts of Knox County are provided with representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Resolution 913.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| I just had a question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Is the ninth district not represented now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| I mean, I get what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| There's no members, no residents of the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| And part of the eighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Nothing south of the river in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Nothing south of the river in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| If I could, Commissioner, unless Commissioner Anders, would you prefer to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| You may answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| The issue you have here is this is a creature of state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| and state statute merely empowers the mayor to make appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| but it does not make any consideration for geographic locations, district boundaries, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| It just merely says the mayor can appoint so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| And that's the reason of the concern, I believe, behind the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| I mean, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| I think it's a legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| But could we get a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| I mean, we may have to put this off a month because I'm not willing to vote for it because I don't know where everybody lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| You know, I mean, is there an appointment that has to be made now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| It's already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| It's already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| This is a mayoral appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| This is for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I don't know what the urgency is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| What I would really like to see is to get a list of the members of the NPC and where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| It was in the paper one day this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| I don't deny that it is because I'd just like to know where everybody's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| I'm voting on something that I don't know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Well, there's no vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| Their addresses are on the NPC website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| I mean, are we going to put it off while I look it up or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| I mean, there's nothing for him to appoint right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| Mr. Brown is just asking that the mayor's office consider geographical representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| Oh, I guess we can pass this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| He can consider and reject anything he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| I mean, I guess that's okay then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Yeah, you don't change the statute is what you're going to need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| Have your legislative delegation actually take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| Yeah, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| That's my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| I was just going to get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| This is just merely asking the administration to consider geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| and there has nothing binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| We can't bind him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Right, out of courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Sort of a feel-good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| That's exactly what I was going to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| We thrash this fairly severely whenever we're talking about the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| That's something that we had some control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| We have them, one in each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| and they have rotating appointment lengths and all that sort of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| so that the Board of Zoning Appeals sort of had a little continuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| and also had a little bit of spread out representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| and I view that's what's being asked for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| Not that there's anything to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| There are no appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| This is just something for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Yes, in case I just wanted to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| this is because Rachel Craig, who was from South Knoxville, has been replaced on MPC, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| And so I'd also usually, I think as it pointed out in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| an MPC appointment usually continues for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| I'm sorry to see Rachel go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| She was one of the few women on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| and I know she was also an advocate for the hillside and slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| So I believe that we need to not only represent all geographic areas of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4736)|
| 1:19:07| which I was very glad to see that you brought this resolution forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| She was also, I'm thinking, the only one on the MPC commission with a degree, a master's in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| So I don't, naturally I'm disappointed in this for a lot of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| but I would like to see more geographic representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| and I would like to see more women appointed to those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| And so I think it's a sad thing for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| and for the city of Knoxville that we're losing Rachel from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Commissioner Warnby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| You're our prerogative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Mr. Brown, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Yes, I would like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| that the commission consider having our chairman write a letter to the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| It's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| You can't bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| It has to be brought to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Do it next month, Mike, and I'll co-sponsor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4820)|

| 1:22:31| Is there anyone here for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| We are adjourned until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Shouse, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| May I briefly discuss my discussion item for Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| I want to take about 90 seconds on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| The discussion item last week ago was rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| and some billing for some emergency calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| I just wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| Again, this was another incident that was brought to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| and possibly to Commissioner Wright because it's his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| The one I mentioned a week ago was seven vehicles showed up at a trailer fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| when the trailer had basically been burned beyond any recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| Another one on Pleasant Valley Road, this was over a year and a half back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| nine vehicles showed up, five engines, a tender, two tankers, and a squad car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| The squad car billing was $7,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Total billing sent to a gentleman was $56,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| Now, rural metro, their credit did, I think, credit to their credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| They gave some credit of about $20,000, but they still sent someone a $35,000 bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| Again, I know it's not under our authority to say do this or do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| or it's too much money or it's too little money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| but I'm going to continue to watch these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| I guess the moral of the story is if you live in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| you better send a check to rural metro or high school or Carnes or somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| or else you're going to get hit with something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| Anyway, I'm going to keep a file on this, not a threat or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| just to keep appraised of what's going on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| and the reasonableness of it to the citizens in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| We will have rural metro at our luncheon next month in August to talk about these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| That was what I wanted to make sure that we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Then also I need to say that I thought we were going to talk about chickens tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| and everyone should have worn a straw hat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| but we didn't have the opportunity to speak chicken tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| One of the things, though, in the newspaper I thought interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| a person writing a letter about, well, if he and his neighbor had a disagreement about chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:48| he could find an amiable solution with that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| and they could get along with if he wanted chickens or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| or if his neighbor wanted chickens or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| But on the area of Alcoa Highway and Maryville Pike, that's all residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| and there's no chickens allowed for this particular individual that was writing in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| He couldn't have chickens if he wanted them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| so I think that's probably what Dr. Briggs wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| I'll tell you, the last month I've been called everything from chicken wreck to Colonel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| So I don't want to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| We are adjourned until 6 o'clock and we'll take up zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5128)|

| 1:27:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5264)|

| 1:27:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Hey, can I call a point of order real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Mark, on that last zoning we just approved, that was where Mr. Testerman came and did they change their mind and want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5271)|
| 1:28:01| Evidently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| He ended up purchasing it from the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| They went ahead and went through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Yes, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| That's quite all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| I had wondered where there must have been leverage in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| In this major road, whatever this thing is called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| some roads within the county are going to be changed in designation from this kind of road to that kind of road, collector, arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:34| Some are graded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Some are graded down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| But right-of-way distances change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| How does that affect the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| The major road plan is used as part of the subdivision regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| so that at the time that a property owner would plat the property to record a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:56| then the right-of-way dedication would be done according to the classification of the major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5336)|
| 1:29:04| We update the plan periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| We've worked with city and county engineers to adjust each of the functional classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| So it comes into play only at the time that a property is platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| So in particular, I asked a question earlier today about it's inside the city from 640 at the mall on Millertown to the top of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:32| and it's going to be three-laned, according to the response I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| Three-laned is in the capital plan for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| But there from Mill Road on Millertown on up east to Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| that's one of the line items that's on this, and it's going from like 70 foot to 100 foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| So that means that any property owner out through there, the next time something happens to that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| they've lost 15 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Probably half of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Well, no, 15 on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Yes, it's possible, and it may have been the impetus for the property owner on the north side to plat their property last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Well, some people may get ahead of the curve, but most of the property owners out there are caught, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| I mean, a person sitting on a piece of property since the 40s, 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| essentially on one side of the road they're going to lose 15 foot of their property just because we passed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| It's not a total of 50 feet because there's already a right-of-way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| Well, it's 70 foot now, and it's going to go to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| It's 70 foot now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| It's going to go to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| So it's 15 foot on each side of the road, provided the road stayed in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5454)|
| 1:31:04| We get a lot of fuss in here about taking of property, and this is one that just seems to slide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| I just want to make sure I understood that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Yes, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| When we do right-of-way, though, does that have to be purchased if they do the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| if they improve the road there, doesn't the state or a county have to purchase that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| If it weren't in a situation of platting, they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| But when someone goes through the subdivision regulations to record a plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| that portion of the right-of-way is considered to be their fair share of the total cost of the future road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| So only if they replat their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Any other conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5512)|

| 1:31:59| 6-B-11-SP is request to CUSLLC from northwest county sector plan amendment from O-Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5519)|

| 1:32:13| Property located south-south Hardin Valley Road, east of Birtle Camp Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| Yes, if you'd come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| I think the ---- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| It's a 1.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| What we want to do is zoning on the front different than the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| Can you explain why you want to MPC wanted to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Can you explain that to me, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| Yeah, this property is roughly half within the slope protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| and then the lower half is adjacent to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| MPC recommended that the lower portion adjacent to Hardin Valley be rezoned to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| and the upper portion, which is in the slope protection area, be rezoned to O-A, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:08| to allow some development consistent with slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| and without eliminating all of the commercial aspects of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| How much acreage is slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| I mean, I talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| I think we spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Roughly half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| He wants to protect the slope as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| but the thing I'm getting, the size of the property, he would like to have the zoning all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| Doesn't the site plan have to be approved prior to him building on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| Not within the commercial zoning or the office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| So he could build at his will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Without any development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| Do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| My name is Eric Mosley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| My address is 2266 Duncan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| Not to take anything away from the work the staff's done on this rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| but the property on each side is zoned C-A, which is what we're asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| and the slope protection area that's designated on the sector plan is not in dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| I mean, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| It's just it's a small piece of property, and having this split zoning is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| I think it's going to need to be changed down the road anyway to try to do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| It just seems like it makes more sense to have one zoning on the whole parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| just, again, given the size of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| It's under two acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| And the C-A zoning that's adjacent runs back pretty far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| Actually, on one side it goes further back than my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| and on the other side it's almost the same distance in going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| So I just, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| It's going to be easier for us to try to do something with it with one zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:11| That's why I was requesting just a single zoning on the whole parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:18| How much of the hill would you have to, the slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| Commissioner Norman, we're going to all want to look at erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| We had some collapse on the condos down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| What kind of things were you wanting to do to the slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| Do you have any plans, conceptual plans or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| Well, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| I mean, we haven't spent a lot of money on that as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| Obviously, the zoning is something that has to take place before we can delve into a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| It's going to be a smaller building, most likely in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:57| The property has quite a bit of frontage on Hardin Valley Road, which would be our access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| As far as the slope, I think the steepest part of the back of this property is a three-to-one slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:13| We may end up with a two-to-one slope on the very back, so that may involve some steepening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:22| As far as the erosion control, that's all going to be handled by the inspection process through the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| as we proceed with getting a building permit and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| Would you, if the commission so would vote for it, would you agree to a, I don't know if we could hold him to a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:45| We couldn't hold him to a site plan if we said we'll give you the zoning if you go before a site approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| Is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| We could add the condition of site plan approval by either staff or by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5814)|
| 1:37:05| I'm going to make a motion that we approve the CA zoning as one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:20| I want to make sure that in the slope protection area he can only do certain things anyway, no matter what it's zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:29| The purpose of the slope protection area in the sector plan is to put the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| and the county commission on notice in cases of rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| and it actually recommends that a planned commercial district be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| We didn't go there because of the size of the parcel being relatively small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| but if you look at the zoning map just down the road to the east along Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| there is planned commercial in an area that has some slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| What about what's beside him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| I mean, it looks like both of the tracks are in the SLPA, but they're zoned what he's asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:09| I don't recall the timing of those zoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| They may have occurred before we started designating slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| or, again, they may have been small enough so that we didn't want to use the planned commercial district there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:25| But it could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| PCA could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| And you're wanting PCA, right, planned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| No, it's CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| But the PCA would necessitate bringing back a plan to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:48| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I want to still think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Has this piece of property been before us in the last year or so or two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| I'd like to make a motion that we approve CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| and have the applicant come before design before the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5953)|
| 1:39:22| Is that acceptable to you to get the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| That would give you the zoning that you desire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| It would give me the peace of mind that we've protected the slope as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| I guess I need to know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| You would have to review our site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| MPC would, either staff or MPC, would review the site plan and approve or modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| We need to pick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Can we have both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| If you were to take it to the planning commission itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| that would be the same as rezoning it to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| If you keep it CA and want some site plan review, you could assign that duty to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| And that avoids putting it on the agenda and it shortens the time frame, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:17| I don't want to hinder his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| He's going to build well, and I have confidence in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| I'm going to go ahead and ask that we approve the CA zoning he desires on the whole 1.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Well, that's kind of the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| He may do a very nice job and be protective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| but I would oppose this request on the basis of the recommendation from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| If it went through with staff approval, I'd be fine with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| but I think staff needs to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| So the motion on the floor is to rezone to CA the entire parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Yes, I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| We have three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| No, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Mr. Chair, we also need to act on the plan amendment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:23| If this is voted down, this is the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6083)|
| 1:41:32| If this is voted down, he can't bring it back before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| This property can't be brought before for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| He could change the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| and one way would be to ask for a planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| I don't have a problem with the sector plan recommendation from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| I think it has to do with the zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| The sector plan request, from his standpoint and our standpoint, is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| There's no issue with the sector plan decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| because the commercial stopped at the slope protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| and the way the map shows it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| the commercial plan designation stops at the slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| So the sector plan is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| As recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| So changing the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| I'd make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| I didn't announce the vote, so we haven't voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| So is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| The motion made in second to approve the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| So that part is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| And this is the one you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| 6-C-11-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6160)|

| 1:42:55| So do you have a motion, 6th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| Reading the tea leaves, I think it's going to probably fail as I asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:07| I think the only way it's going to pass is if we put MPC staff approval on the SLPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| I think that's the only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| You'd have to submit a site to them to get the CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| and they'd have to approve or modify and work with you on getting that slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| And if I make that motion and it passes, then you have your CA with approval of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| If not, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| You've got to come before with a different request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| Is that correct, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| No, I don't have a problem bringing a site plan in to staff for their approval if that's a condition of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| I'd like to make a motion we approve the CA for the whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| and with the stipulation they have to go through staff approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| We just approved the sector plan with part of it commercial and part of it slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:08| And here we're going to come back here and say okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Does that conflict, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| The slope protection area acts kind of like an overlay over the commercial, part of the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:24| So motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| 6-D-11-RZ is a request of Van and Pam Griffin for rezoning from RA, low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:37| to A agricultural property located southwest side of Schaffner Lane northwest of Griffin Road in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:44| Are the applicants here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| There is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Let's hear from the MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| If you give us your report, then we'll hear from the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| and then we'll hear from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| Mr. Chair, this is a request for rezoning from RA, low-density residential, to A agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| It pertains to a little over one acre located on the east side of Schaffner Lane north of Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:19| The zoning map shows that this property is in an area that includes predominantly, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| either RA, low-density residential zoning, some planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| but there's also a significant amount of agricultural zoning still in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| specifically to the north of the subject property as well as to the east on the other side of Schaffner Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| In looking at the request, the staff considered the zoning of the property, what it was, the request of agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:55| Considering the surrounding nature of the area, the characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| you have some large lot agricultural zoning in two directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| This lot is of comparable size to those lots in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| In terms of zoning, we saw no problem with recommending approval to the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:18| So the staff recommended approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| and the MPC voted by a vote of nine to three to approve that recommendation to A agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6381)|
| 1:46:30| If the applicant would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| Anything you'd like to say to us as to why you would like your property rezoned or anything you'd like to say to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| Yes, this is in regard to basically keeping pet chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| and any zoning ordinances that come through are usually to have four hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| and I want to keep a rooster and a few more than four hens for the eggs and as pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| and hens are happier with their rooster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| Can you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| I'm Pamela Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| I live on 7803 Schaffner Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| We've been there 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| In the last few years, we've just decided we always wanted chickens, so we have a few chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| The condos were built behind our house, and that got to be an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| and so I had spoke with one of the neighbors directly behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| Actually, two of the condos back up to our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| and so we have since put up fencing to keep them on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| The other neighbors do not care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| They like the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| They think they're funny, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| So I really don't see what their problem is with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| They're on our property and other people that don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| That's just what I was wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| That's why we moved out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| It was kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| So with agriculture, you'd be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| My grandfather was a chicken farmer, and any time anybody mentions about chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| I always revert back to my childhood, and I remember those big chicken barns he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| This is a small dog pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| So you're only talking about a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| But under agricultural, she would be able to do this by doing the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| I just had a question, so I have a good idea in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| This is about an acre of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| and you said on two of the sides that it's zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| Those are large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| And then what are on the other two sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| It is residential to the south of us, and the condos are to the west of us on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:45| RA zoning is to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| PR zoning or plant residential zoning is to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| The condos is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| How close to the lot line are those condos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| They built them right up to practically the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| There is a drop-down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| It's not directly there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| I mean, it's like a 10-foot wall there, but that's basically where it is for those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:19| This is just a – I think I know the answer to it, but just so it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| Once this is rezoned agriculture, I think according to the Right to the Farm Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| you basically can do anything with the land you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| I mean, you could put a hog farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| You could put cows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| You could put – I mean, you could put – I mean, you could do – I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| The property would have all of the rights that are provided by the Agricultural Zone District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| I don't like hogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| We do have someone here who has expressed opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Would you like to come forward and address the commission as to the reason for your opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| If you could give us your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| My name is Robert Bean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| I live at 7821 Thomas Henry Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| I live in the condominium complex that backs up to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| And the problem we had with the chickens is they were not contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| They were free-running chickens, and they were coming down onto our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| And since then, they have put up fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| But just like Dr. Briggs said, when there's rezoned agriculture, they can have anything they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| And, you know, I'm not saying that they will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| but a small fence that keeps a chicken out is not going to keep a cow or a pig out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| And, you know, the problem we had is they were free-running chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| Like in the city, when the people in the city went for their chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| you didn't rezone their property agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| They had to keep them in a pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| And, you know, that's all we're asked, if they can keep their chickens in a pen or if stipulated like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| We just don't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| If I wanted chickens in my backyard, I'd have my own chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| And I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| I buy my chickens at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| Yes, I just want to make another comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| You may or may not be aware of this, but earlier in the county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| we passed a resolution to send to the NPC to report back to us on both the city's ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:24| and regulations regarding chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| And I assume they'll also do some research maybe of what's been done in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| and come back to us with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:37| You know, if this is really the purpose for going from one zoning to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| you might have to wait a month or two to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| But I don't know how long it'll take NPC to get that back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| probably not too long since the city has already gone through this same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| But my grandfather wasn't a chicken farmer, but I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| And 4-H, you know, 4-H, White Lagoon Chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| But, you know, roosters do make a lot of noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| and I don't think you're going to raise a hog there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| but the people that come there after you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| And, you know, I think that's a consideration that we do have to look at for the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:24| because once that zoning's changed, I mean, it's Katy, bar the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| And I'm really not concerned about you, and I can understand about the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| And if we pass this ordinance, you know, we do have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| it does protect the people that are backed up to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| in that there won't be roosters waking them up at 4 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| and then there will be a limit on the number of chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| And it may not be what you want, it may not be what your neighbor wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| but it may be a compromise that may or may not be a compromise that both of you could live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| Seventh District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Ms. Griffin, here's where we're at with it, or here's where I'm at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| I understand what you're trying to do with the chickens and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| and you sort of have to understand what your neighbors, what they're looking at and what potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| because, as you know, if you sell this land and you move off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| somebody else could come in and they could put something else in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| But do you realize the actual encountered zone that my property is to there is no longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6801)|
| 1:53:29| not as far as from here to the wall there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| It's not that much of it that borders them, even in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| Besides that, the greater portion to the north of the condos is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:43| If they have goats and such, they could go in and put in a true hog farm because they have certainly more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| And I just think it's prejudicial to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Well, what they're looking at, too, is, you know, they've had chickens in the condominiums there, in their flower beds and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6833)|
| 1:54:01| And they haven't since last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| We've had our chickens penned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| When we have let them out, we've watched them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| We put a fence up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| And certainly it was a fence to keep chickens in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| If there were anything more to be in, you'd need more fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| And we put them up at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| They go to roost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| We let them out just to basically play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| Well, as Dr. Briggs says, we have something that's come before MPC and we're waiting to hear that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| I'll be honest with you, I would just feel more comfortable if we wait until we hear MPC's report next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| and come back to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| It would be better for your neighbors and for you and give us something more to stand on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| So I'm going to make a motion that we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| If you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| Is that a form of motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Do you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| You decide for me or against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| I respect you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| This is really dragged down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| This is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| It's not that great an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| I'll respect your decision either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| Well, I've received several phone calls, several e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| and several letters from this disturbance of the chickens messing up other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| So just in fairness to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| Make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Are they specific to when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| This has not been since the spring since we've put the fence up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| I just got a letter last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| You're talking like it happened at the NPC meeting and it hadn't been for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| You're an intelligent person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| You're all intelligent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| Make your decision, but we don't want to put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| And I like the fact that you've got them pinned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| You're taking some ownership of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| You're making the right move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I mean, that's in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| So unless anybody else from the condos has anything else they want to say, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| We don't want to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| If you decide I don't need to do this, I'm going to respect your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| I won't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| We just want to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| Sir, do you want to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| You know, I'm all for postponing it if that's what you want to do, but I don't think he's happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| I mean, we're willing to wait and postpone to see if Dr. Briggs, the suggestion he made, goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:22| I mean, ever since this started and we started complaining, they've kept their chickens up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| Since all this has been going on, they've been abiding by what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| But, you know, from what I know, they're zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| They're not supposed to have chickens at all, but they've had them the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| But, you know, since we've been complaining about this, they've kept them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| They've got a pin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| They're keeping them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| But, you know, legally, I don't think they're allowed to keep them at all since they are still zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:55| I've made a motion to postpone 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| Can I make one more comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| I'm not a young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Could you speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| I'm not a young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| I'm 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| My mother's 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| She's not in good health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| She lives four hours away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Her mother, ten hours away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| An aunt, six hours away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| Two of the three are on the brink of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| I don't know if I'll be able to make your meeting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| I need the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| Well, if you'll call me, let me know that you cannot make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| Then we will, if we had notice, then we can postpone for another 30 days for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| We'll work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| It's automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| If the applicant is not here when we call it, it's postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| In regards to his reference that we are residential and had chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| we thought we were agricultural at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| We're property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| We've gone through the process of a $500 fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| We're trying to do the right thing because we know the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| Let me ask the Neighborhood Association, the condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| will you all work with them until we can get this agreeable with you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| I still don't want to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| If you're going to vote against me, vote against me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| I'll respect your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| I think just for your knowledge, we can vote against you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| but if 30 days or two months, whenever we finally pass the chicken thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| you can get your chickens back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| I won't fight it if you vote against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| There's no fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| This is a liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| We've moved out to this part of the county that's traditionally agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| We're not in New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| We're in Halls Crossroads, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| But you're in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| Let me add, you know, I think, and I don't mean this as a confrontational thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| can they appeal this like to one of the chancellery court or somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| or what happens if he says he'll fight it, but how do you fight it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| No, I did not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| No, I mean, I'm not meaning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| I'm asking because I don't know if somebody really doesn't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| and, you know, we go through the whole process here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| and somebody doesn't like the zoning, how do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| I mean, what is the appeals process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| Is it through the courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| The process would be through the courts at this point, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Yeah, I didn't know if this was the end of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| I'm not, like I said, I just asked that for my own edification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| These folks, I think they're wanting to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| They just want some chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| and the people behind them have said they don't mind as long as they keep them pinned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| but their concern is should they move, someone else may come in, do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| Can we approve this with a stipulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Or is it just that, okay, if you have agricultural, then Katie, bar the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:48| County Commission has the authority to attach conditions to any rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| Roy was just mentioning in my ear that in a case like this where there's been a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| they allow the property owner to continue that activity or use until the rezoning case is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7199)|
| 2:00:11| So as long as you postpone making a decision, they will be allowed to keep the chickens that are in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7211)|
| 2:00:21| But, yes, you may add conditions, and those conditions could be excluding a list of uses for that particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7221)|
| 2:00:31| or making a statement such as any animals shall be limited to chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:39| Can you do that under the Right to Farm Act, though, on agriculturally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| I thought maybe there was an exception there because that's a state law that if it's zoned agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| you can do certain things that you can't do under any other zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| State law says that a local jurisdiction may not use the zoning code to prohibit people from farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7253)|
| 2:01:03| So if we were to do a resolution that says the restriction would be for chickens only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| I wouldn't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| That's just going against rights to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Either it is or either it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| I can't go with you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| That's why we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| I mean, we're not farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| We're not from farm families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| But the point is that we just want to feel a little in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| I mean, we supposedly were at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| The chickens are just something fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| The article from, was it Michigan, a woman had two raised flower beds that she had vegetables in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7297)|
| 2:01:45| and they were threatening to send her to jail because she couldn't put those vegetables in her front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| and wouldn't take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| That's the sort of thing I want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| We have a vegetable garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| We tinker with things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| And I just don't want to have to come back next year and fight because we've got a garden in a residential place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| And it's that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| I just want to be left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| Just to sit there and play in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| Looking at the map of what's going on here, looking at KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:25| and also reading from the descriptions of MPC, looking at MPC first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:33| it says all these lands are either vacant or developed with residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| And all are vacant or developed with residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:51| And another phrase is that this particular area is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| To me, there's a significant difference between zoning and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:06| A lot of Knox County outside the city, I believe I got into this maybe last month when we first introduced chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:16| Chicken George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| Because you have to have sewer or an acre of ground to have a septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:31| That's the way the county operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| If there's no sewer, you've got to have an acre of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| And I think it also says in the MPC supporting documentation that sewer may be available in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| but would have to be extended if it were to serve this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| That has nothing to do with anything except whenever I look at the map, whether it's agricultural or PR or RA or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:59| I see all these different initials all over the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| The area is predominantly residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| There's not really any, except from the comment that was made, there's a three or four acre spot that has goats on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:18| I don't know that as I was out there that I saw much else being really truly agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| The place is predominantly a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7465)|
| 2:04:32| And I think that's what we have before us that we've sent off to MPC is that in a predominantly residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7472)|
| 2:04:41| we're going to say that it's residential except maybe they can have chickens in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| That something is to be studied, recommended, planned, and then implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| This chicken law is probably going to call for cages or pinning or, you know, a multitude of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7494)|
| 2:05:05| But if we want to say this particular site is agricultural, I believe what's coming before us right now is the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| if it's agricultural, then it's agricultural by U.S. law, not by whatever we would like to restrict it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:20| And where this property owner has pinned their chickens right now, it could be that if they were in an ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:29| they might not have to pin their chickens next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| It's beginning to be the light that comes up over my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| So it's either we have to have a little bit more direction about what's going to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:45| or if we rezone this, down zone this to ag, then it doesn't matter what we say about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| or the next-door neighbors say about it, chickens will be or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| I'm not saying chickens would run free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| I'm just saying that our legal requirements would be fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| Chickens can go where they want to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| So I believe there's a lot that's come before us, a lot more that I didn't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| except whenever I said earlier I thought we was going to talk chickens and that's why I wore a straw hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| Now I've got the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| The gentleman that was here from the Condo Association who had said that since you had brought your concerns up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| they have been keeping them contained, especially since this chicken thing is on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:39| Do we even need to do this today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| Would you be willing to withdraw complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| Or if they're doing what you asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| haven't we already reached a compromise where everyone's satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| Do we need to take this step today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| Because I can't support spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:09| One last comment and I promise I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| No, no, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| Where we have this pen right now to keep these birds, we have a 15-foot easement with a neighbor to my north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:21| She's zoned, I believe, agriculturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| We're talking about 15 feet, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| And then on the other side of her, it's a goat farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:36| To the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| But you can't leave it the way it is, Amy, because as the zone stands now, they're illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7657)|
| 2:07:44| And I really want to keep the rooster and everything keeps the rooster away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| No one's even complained about the rooster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| That we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| That we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| You hear the complaints before I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| If you would like to keep the chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| then it seems like the best course of action would be to let us postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| because you can continue to keep the chickens until we vote on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| or not chickens are going to be allowed in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| So that seems like the best course to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7686)|
| 2:08:14| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| Yeah, I just wanted to say again is that really having the chickens in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| is not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| I don't think that and I hope that the county code enforcers until we get this settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| because we're very close, you know, would not enforce that in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| But all you're trying to do is when you're in a residential area is we're trying to put some limits on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| If we say this is agriculture, you can just open the pen and let the chickens run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| Well, we do let the chickens run on the people's yards that don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| But you have to put them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| That's one thing I wanted to say, that predators would not allow people to let chickens run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| You have to have them up or else dogs, foxes, we've seen coyotes, raccoons, everything kills them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7734)|
| 2:09:02| But I'm not sure because we haven't gotten the report back from the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| but I believe that in the city they did put some restrictions on roosters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| They did put restrictions on numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| And it is zoned in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| It's a growth area, which means it's really the projections are is that this will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| there will be more areas that will be zoned residential as some of these farms get, you know, get sold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| You know, I think that, you know, what we're proposing is if we put this off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| until we get the report back from the NPC, I would ask the code enforcers not to enforce it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| until we get this, get it straightened out on what some of the restrictions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| You may not be able to keep as many chickens as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| You may not be able to keep a rooster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| And you will have to keep your chickens put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| That's something that, you know, that you should live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| You know, saying you didn't know it was zoned, you know, you thought it was zoned agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| usually that's pretty easy to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| Didn't know it was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| Well, it is the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| We've also been paying taxes on a piece of property that we don't own for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| I wouldn't have thought that a bank would loan money on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| We would have missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| And that was a Knox County issue too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| We don't know these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| We're trusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| Sometimes, well, sometimes ignorance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| I've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| I'm ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| I've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| I've paid tax for 20 years on a piece of property I can't get the money back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110725part2?start=7834)|
