| 0:16:59| So we just have to bring the license to you guys and pick up the new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1019.02)|
| 0:17:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1023.02)|
| 0:17:04| We have to wait until everything has been approved from foreign codes before you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1024.02)|

| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1032.02)|

| 0:17:17| so we have no idea if that's been approved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1037.02)|

| 0:17:21| I'm sure they'll let you know if it's been approved, but I'll check myself before the permit is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1041.02)|
| 0:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1046.02)|

| 0:17:55| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1075.02)|
| 0:17:58| I only know what I've heard on TV, what happened last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1078.02)|
| 0:18:02| El Tequila was there, so I've got great concerns about this place, and I'm sure Commissioner Lee does too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1082.02)|
| 0:18:10| With the board's permission, I have the official police report from the major crime detective that worked the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1090.02)|
| 0:18:18| and I'll read some of his explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1098.02)|
| 0:18:22| But basically what happened was there was multiple fights inside El Tequila on May the 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1102.02)|
| 0:18:30| and the lead head of security of the gentleman has talked to you multiple times here saying that he's handling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1110.02)|
| 0:18:37| Him and his security staff pushed basically the fight out into the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1117.02)|
| 0:18:42| where between 30 and 50 people were in multiple fights in different groups all through the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1122.02)|
| 0:18:49| when our officers were called to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1129.02)|
| 0:18:52| While they were en route, a suspect that was taken into custody, Mr. Valadares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1132.02)|
| 0:18:59| retrieved a gun from his truck and stood in the middle of the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1139.02)|
| 0:19:02| and fired multiple rounds from a semi-automatic Ruger handgun until the slide locked back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1142.02)|
| 0:19:08| He then put the gun back into his truck, and the police arrived and took him into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1148.02)|
| 0:19:14| There was video surveillance that's available of the parking lot where you'll see multiple fights going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1154.02)|
| 0:19:22| It was almost impossible to identify who all was fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1162.02)|
| 0:19:25| Of course, when our officers got there, they spent the next three and a half hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1165.02)|
| 0:19:28| multiple officers just trying to get the scene under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1168.02)|
| 0:19:32| Two people went to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1172.02)|
| 0:19:36| It was just, in my opinion, an act of God that somebody wasn't killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1176.02)|
| 0:19:41| He fired in the air instead of firing into the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1181.02)|
| 0:19:43| That was the only thing that stopped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1183.02)|
| 0:19:46| There was a secondary assault inside the bar between three females that started before the big fight started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1186.02)|
| 0:19:57| There was a separate police report made for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1197.02)|
| 0:20:00| In that three and a half hours, we had fire, EMS, an entire patrol shift, the shooting call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1200.02)|
| 0:20:10| an investigation into other injuries, a major traffic problem that required our officers to direct traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1210.02)|
| 0:20:17| to try and get people out of the parking lot as orderly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1217.02)|
| 0:20:20| and then a traffic accident happened while they were trying to get everybody out of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1220.02)|
| 0:20:25| But that was basically three and a half hours of our officers' time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1225.02)|
| 0:20:30| less than 30 days from the time their beer permit was given back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1230.02)|
| 0:20:36| I am requesting that the beer board take it up into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1236.02)|
| 0:20:40| I understand they have to be here to give a defense that El Tequila's beer permit be revoked permanently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1240.02)|
| 0:20:48| and I would also request that these owners not be allowed to have a beer permit to open up a secondary location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1248.02)|
| 0:20:57| It seems to be the kind of a round-robin-door policy that El Tequila will close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1257.02)|
| 0:21:02| they'll wait a couple of months, reopen under another name, same owners, same problems, and it's just under a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1262.02)|
| 0:21:10| Thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1270.02)|

| 0:22:55| Because there was no forensics to be had, the officer went in, asked for video surveillance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1375.02)|
| 0:23:00| was told that there was no video surveillance of anything inside the bar at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1380.02)|
| 0:23:06| If you will remember, I believe at the February beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1386.02)|
| 0:23:10| they said they had absolutely no idea it just took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1390.02)|
| 0:23:13| The officer did go in and notify them why he wanted their video surveillance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1393.02)|
| 0:23:17| and was informed that there was no video at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1397.02)|
| 0:23:21| This board, in my opinion, might want to also send a letter to the AG about this being a public nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1401.02)|
| 0:23:31| and she has the power to shut down her public nuisance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1411.02)|
| 0:23:38| That, again, I could take it up there, but a letter from the board would probably carry way more weight than my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1418.02)|
| 0:23:46| This board should consider that as well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1426.02)|
| 0:23:48| Besides sending it to the state for liquor, we should consider sending the AG one as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1428.02)|
| 0:23:53| because if these kinds of things are happening, this is not tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1433.02)|
| 0:23:56| I do have all the documentation you could possibly want to aid in that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1436.02)|
| 0:24:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1441.02)|
| 0:24:03| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1443.02)|
| 0:24:05| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1445.02)|
| 0:24:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1447.02)|
| 0:24:09| Would you be able to send us that surveillance footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1449.02)|
| 0:24:13| Is that something that you can send as a link to a secure site for the commissioners or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1453.02)|
| 0:24:19| I would have to get the major crime detective that has that video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1459.02)|
| 0:24:23| Since you've referenced it, I would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1463.02)|
| 0:24:26| I think it would be relevant for us to better understand the atmosphere there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1466.02)|
| 0:24:30| Director Boot, could you outline what the separate of potentially some strongly worded letters to agency partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1470.02)|
| 0:24:40| What are the tools at our disposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1480.02)|
| 0:24:45| First of all, I think that Commissioner Ward is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1485.02)|
| 0:24:49| I think a letter from this board, as Lieutenant Walker said, would carry a lot of weight with the DA's office asking them to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1489.02)|
| 0:24:59| They had recently done something out there at the Gentleman's Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1499.02)|
| 0:25:02| Was that the name of it on Alcoa Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1502.02)|
| 0:25:07| Daisy Dukes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1507.02)|
| 0:25:09| But given that we don't have a beer board violation in front of us, if we add it to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1509.02)|
| 0:25:15| do we have the right to suspend without infraction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1515.02)|
| 0:25:19| What are our tools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1519.02)|
| 0:25:20| Let me read you the statute because it goes beyond just a sale to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1520.02)|
| 0:25:26| 57.5108 says the beer board or county legislative body which issued a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1526.02)|
| 0:25:33| hereinafter referred to as the board, is authorized to suspend or revoke the permit as provided in TCA's 57.5108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1533.02)|
| 0:25:44| Suspension, revocation, or imposition of a civil penalty may be made for violation of any provision of the beer law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1544.02)|
| 0:25:54| as set out in 57.5 of the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1554.02)|
| 0:25:57| That's what we do on a basis of sales to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1557.02)|
| 0:26:02| Or, or, whenever it satisfactorily appears that the licensed premises are being maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1562.02)|
| 0:26:10| and operated in a manner which is detrimental to the public health, safety, or morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1570.02)|
| 0:26:17| So you do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1577.02)|
| 0:26:19| You can take away their beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1579.02)|
| 0:26:23| And also, I mean, we did this before where there was, we had them here before on a sale of beer, but it wasn't beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1583.02)|
| 0:26:31| It was some sort of alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1591.02)|
| 0:26:35| It wasn't beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1595.02)|
| 0:26:37| Margaritas, and I think the sheriff's office reported that to the ABC in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1597.02)|
| 0:26:42| and they were drug over to Nashville to answer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1602.02)|
| 0:26:46| So that's another tool that I think would be, and I think it came from the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1606.02)|
| 0:26:52| I don't remember on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1612.02)|
| 0:26:54| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1614.02)|
| 0:26:55| We had purchased margaritas and another type of a liquor drink, or it was wine from another business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1615.02)|
| 0:27:04| We sent them to TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1624.02)|
| 0:27:06| And they are reviewing El Tequila's liquor permit at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1626.02)|
| 0:27:10| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1630.02)|
| 0:27:11| They emailed me last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1631.02)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1632.02)|
| 0:27:14| Just to clarify, is the mechanism, the license holder has a right to appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1634.02)|
| 0:27:24| so someone would need to add that to the agenda and have the clerk send notice to them saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1644.02)|
| 0:27:32| say, the June agenda, there is a resolution or a motion to suspend your beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1652.02)|
| 0:27:41| so they can come defend themselves, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1661.02)|
| 0:27:45| Under that line of the statute, yes, you'd have to give them notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1665.02)|
| 0:27:48| Would that be a resolution or would that just be an agenda item, consideration of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1668.02)|
| 0:27:53| I think it could just be, or you could do it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1673.02)|
| 0:27:56| I think you could make a motion for the law director and the sheriff to, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1676.02)|
| 0:28:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1681.02)|
| 0:28:02| I believe they are represented by T. Scott Jones Legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1682.02)|
| 0:28:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1686.02)|
| 0:28:07| If you send a letter to him, I'm sure that would solve the notification problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1687.02)|
| 0:28:11| I'll defer to my colleague in District 7 who might want to make a motion to this board to take some action next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1691.02)|
| 0:28:22| and not do that on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1702.02)|
| 0:28:24| Commissioner Lee, I recognize your line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1704.02)|
| 0:28:28| First of all, I would like that surveillance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1708.02)|
| 0:28:32| You're going to send that to us, the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1712.02)|
| 0:28:35| Yes, I can send it to one or several of you as soon as I get a hold of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1715.02)|
| 0:28:41| You can send it to the commission office and they can get it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1721.02)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1723.02)|
| 0:28:44| And then I'll make the motion that Mr. Commissioner Jay just laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1724.02)|
| 0:28:49| If you wouldn't care if we could finish discussion for this since we've started it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1729.02)|
| 0:28:56| and I will defer back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1736.02)|
| 0:28:59| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1739.02)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1740.02)|
| 0:29:01| So just to clarify, we have worked with our partners at the Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Commission are aware of this incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1741.02)|
| 0:29:10| Have they been officially notified from you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1750.02)|
| 0:29:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1753.02)|
| 0:29:14| One of the agents reached out to me last week requesting a copy of the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1754.02)|
| 0:29:18| and said they were in the process of revoking their status as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1758.02)|
| 0:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1763.02)|
| 0:29:24| And then just the other question, Lieutenant Walker, when you reference the police report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1764.02)|
| 0:29:29| you're actually saying that's a sheriff's office report and not a city of Knoxville police report or what actually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1769.02)|
| 0:29:36| It is a sheriff's department's official police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1776.02)|
| 0:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1781.02)|
| 0:29:42| So you still call it a police report even though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1782.02)|
| 0:29:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1784.02)|
| 0:29:45| Okay, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1785.02)|
| 0:29:46| Just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1786.02)|
| 0:29:47| Lieutenant Walker, I know T. Scott Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1787.02)|
| 0:29:51| He's a fine lawyer, and in order to avoid any procedural problems up front on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1791.02)|
| 0:29:58| what do you issue when there's a sale to a minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1798.02)|
| 0:30:03| Is it a citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1803.02)|
| 0:30:05| We issue citations to the person that violated the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1805.02)|
| 0:30:10| And that citation, what does it say to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1810.02)|
| 0:30:13| They have to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1813.02)|
| 0:30:14| It's a misdemeanor citation instead of taking them to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230515-beer-board_202307?start=1814.02)|
