| 0:02:00| Is there a motion to approve our meeting from December of December 2nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Any corrections, additions, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Any items to do with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Any items to be withdrawn tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Item 11C, refresh this council's memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| We passed the zoning a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| One of the parts of it, one of the conditions was the developer was going to pay for the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| The developer is apparently trying to rescind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| We might have to address that at a later date, but the development is not going forward right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| So engineering is requesting that this be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| A second by Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| All those in favor, withdrawing, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Items withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Any other items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| This is actually one that Ms. Poplin would need to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Item 11B, I'd like this as a sidewalk ordinance or sidewalk resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| I'd like to postpone that for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| And I want to just ask Ms. Poplin to real briefly say what's happening moving forward on the legal issues around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| If you'd give us your name and address, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| No, we are making progress on our legal research into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| I announced we'd need some time at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| And we are making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| It is a rather complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| We need a bit of additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| We want to have our recommendations in the next little while and get them to council's attorney, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| to look at before our final recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| For four weeks, Mr. Becker has asked for a four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| Any conversation on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| I need a second, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Any questions, conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| I don't believe we have any consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Mayors report to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| I have three or four items real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Those of you on council and hopefully those listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| if you had a chance to go out to Central and see how that is shaping up with the re-striping there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| it really looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| There's a lot of progress being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Crews began working, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| this month to re-stripe a six-block section along North Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| including the Happy Hollow section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| As a result, more folks are able to park on the street near businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Bike lanes are marked and traffic is flowing just fine, which has kind of been a little bit of an experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| We felt confident, but you never quite know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| So, so far, things look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| If you hadn't had a chance, I'd encourage you to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Christmas in the city has been incredible this year with crowds at really each event being record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| everything from the tree lighting to the parade that a lot of us got a chance to take part in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| to Comcast in the city kickoff last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Our special events crew has done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| If you get a chance, thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| Graduation ceremony for our 2008 fire department class is tomorrow night at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| at the convention center up in the ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| We have 26 new firefighters that have just finished 24 weeks of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| I think we have one of the most comprehensive training programs of any department, really, in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| So we have those 26 will be on duty at a fire station somewhere by the middle of next week, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| So if you get a chance graduation tomorrow at 6, there's a brief reception after it in the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| And finally, a lot of you all know this, but it is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| We opened the seven gold LEED certified affordable housing units over on Chestnut in Houston on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=346)|
| 0:05:55| For those of you who aren't familiar with LEED certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| it's a standard for which we measure the environmental integrity and energy efficiency of a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| And just to let you know how hard it is to get gold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| there's only one other gold certified house in the entire state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| which happens to be former Vice President Gore's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| And in terms of affordable housing units that are gold certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| there are zero other in the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| These are the only affordable housing units that are gold certified in the entire country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| So that is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| And so I want to thank CAC and HUD and our community development and Knox Housing Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| And I'm sure I'm forgetting somebody else, but it's a great partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| And there's wonderful houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Enough out of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Councilman Holquist, we'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| I want to remind council and the folks watching, the folks here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| I mentioned at the last council meeting, but tomorrow night, Wednesday, the 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| starting at 7 p.m. in Market Square is Tour Delight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| Second year, yet last year, the first year, they were anticipating a handful of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| and they got nearly 200 people on bicycles, decorated with various lights and luminaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| It's an opportunity for people to show up and decorate their bikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| bicycle trailers and other appendages to their bicycles with a variety of festive lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| and creative lighting solutions to the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| And they're actually going to start doing inspections and some other events at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| but the tour takes off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Actually, it's at Creech Park on Market Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| which is one block south of Market Square as far as the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| But it's going to go into the neighborhood that I happen to live in and represent, Island Home Park, this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| So encourage folks to come and decorate your bicycles if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| I have a potential conflict, but I'm going to try to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| I hope to see some council colleagues there on bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| Councilman Hall, I'm sure you're going to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=486)|

| 0:12:07| Would you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Well, in the sense that I believe this has been thoroughly discussed and looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| I attended the BCA meeting where this was sent on to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| And Mr. Blattner is here, but I do not believe that he cares to speak in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| These are very unusual circumstances with these lots, the way they are drawn out and laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| And they did reach a very good compromise regarding the amount of square footage on the lot that's to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=753)|
| 0:12:41| So I think we just need to commend them for doing our work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| And I move to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=765)|

| 0:13:12| Mr. Hoeklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Yeah, I just want to point out that Tony is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| And I talked with him before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| It's going to be a challenging time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| We have apparently a switch in leadership at the top and the committees, chairs and subcommittee chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| So it's just a whole, potentially a whole new day in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| And nobody quite knows exactly what that's going to mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| But he's going to have his work cut out for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| If you combine that with a billion-dollar shortfall, I'd say it will be an interesting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Tony, I guess this is your sixth year working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| I'm sorry, six or maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=824)|

| 0:14:57| I don't have any problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| No, I appreciate the opportunity to give just a little bit of explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| As Council knows, TDOT, at some point in the not-too-distant future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| is going to have to close Henley Street Bridge for a significant period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| 18 to 24 months is the estimated time frame, and rebuild, replace the deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| take the deck off completely, rebuild the entire top of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| make some modifications or repairs to the top of the structural elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| the arches, I think, or the verticals coming off the arches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| And the plan, as I understand it, is to widen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| There's some question as to exactly what that's going to mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| Are they going to widen it for additional vehicular lanes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| That's what we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Are they also going to widen it for pedestrian use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| What are the implications there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| How are they going to address the adjacent areas on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| on the south end of the bridge, and Henley Street on the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| And that's on the context-sensitive solution side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| which the CSS process is something that TDOT has undertaken in recent years on major projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| And I think there are a lot of people in the community, especially south of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| that would like to see that level of public input and engagement happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| Also, the mitigation side, the question is, how is TDOT going to help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| those people who will be most impacted by the closure for this extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| address the difficulties that that places on residents, especially businesses and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| other stakeholders in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| So this is a request to TDOT to initiate a process like that to help address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| And there's plenty of historic precedent on other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1009)|

| 0:24:38| and all the time that you have invested in an effort to complete a parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| which will protect neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1483)|

| 0:24:50| who have helped us get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1490)|

| 0:25:12| that our residents will be properly educated about the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| and will be guaranteed a grace period with warnings but no citations until enforcement begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1517)|

| 0:25:33| which is separate from MPC, that is, it's not yet part of the official record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| MPC has presented four options to you without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Option A is the first parking ordinance we presented to council members last spring of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| B is our first ordinance which was modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| C is the administration ordinance which was presented to council at the council workshop on parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| D is an additional MPC ordinance presented after city council referred the task force ordinance back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| for commission for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| We hope that you will vote to support the task force ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| and that council will seek to resolve the issue of enforcement of the ordinance on weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| and after work hours if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1582)|

| 0:26:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| You have a question, I guess, about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1602)|

| 0:26:44| I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| We've got, what, four options to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Five options to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| With B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| So we've got the task force proposed, the city proposed, the MPC staff proposed, the first proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1611)|
| 0:27:00| And then the one everybody agrees on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| So tell me which one is the one that everybody agrees on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| This one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| This one, in some places, option E, which I'm not sure where it is in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| but online it's the big thing under the red there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| It is entitled front yard parking ordinance option drafted by the community task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| city engineering and inspections dated 12-10-2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| And it has a memo on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| The memo from Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1655)|
| 0:27:35| It would be in between 12-D and 12-E probably in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| And I believe we're going to need a motion, Mr. Swanson, to adopt that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Is that, would that be an amendment to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Actually a motion to amend to include that option rather than any of the previous options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| I will move that that memorandum be included as option E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| And what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| What was the last thing you said, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| That's good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| And will you second that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Now we're on discussion, I guess, to the, I guess right now we're discussing, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| the amendment discussing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| So we can talk about either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Go ahead, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| You're still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| I want to thank everybody who worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| A lot of what seemed like very diverse ideas that came to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| and people sat around the table and worked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| and found they pretty much agreed on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| And I guess in the end agreed on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| I do have sort of a question for the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| I don't know who wants to field this one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| What's the plan for implementing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Because I know there's some level of a certain time period we're going to be enforcing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| Less likely we're going to be advertising it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| If somebody could explain that, it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Are you asking in terms of the time frames for each one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| In terms of how long we're going to try to publicize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| how long you're going to get a warning, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Deb, do you want to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Do you have the time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Or Bill, do you have those exact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| No, I was just going to remind you that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| And I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| I just didn't write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| So I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Well, I think Terry can handle that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Terry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| I understand that we decided on was that we'll have the ordinance will be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| When it becomes effective, we'll have a six-week period of public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| And we talked about the means to get the information out to the public so nobody's surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| And that was one of your major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| And then after that six-week time period, there will be another six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| which will put the true and the enforcement period will begin in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| about the time of the Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| when everybody's cleaning up and getting Knoxville pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| So that there will be the first six weeks of education, a second six weeks where if there's a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1806)|
| 0:30:16| the person who has been complained about will be visited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| or get a letter telling them that we now have an ordinance in effect warning them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| but no citation will be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| So they will not be fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Then this will be for another six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| So you'll have two six-week time periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| In the packet somewhere, there was this suggestion floated of this being rolling out in a staggered kind of basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| with it being effective in one area for a certain period of time and then going citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| And I wondered if that was still on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| or how the administration and how the members that worked with this coalition felt about that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| Because I thought there were perhaps some merit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| I'll let Terri speak for the coalition and then I'll speak for the administration after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| We were opposed to an opt-in or a period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| Not an opt-in, but a staggered implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| So a trial period in a smaller area to sort of refine the process with the intent of it going citywide after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| What the city called the pilot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| We were opposed to that because we didn't think that was fair to all areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| We thought if it's enacted, it should be enacted for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| I think we, you know, given our druthers, we still see some benefit in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| I think the coalition felt real strongly, so we're willing to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| and work on it with this implementation period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| That's where we came up with let's have a period of time where we're just warning folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| If we see it's a major issue and it's different than what the implementation is harder than we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| we thought we could call time out at that point in time before citations go into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| come back to council and say, here's what we've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So that was kind of a, I don't know if it's a compromise position or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| but it gave us a little bit more confidence in knowing how difficult the implementation is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| Mayor Haslam, could I just comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| It wasn't just to kind of get our feet in concrete position that the coalition took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| but it was really because this was a very widespread group of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| that had worked on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| And the interest was as strong in one area of the city as it was in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| And it just did not seem that there was any way to properly handle that to select one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| And then, you know, basically why would it be fair to one property owner to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| be able to still park in a way that we have considered to be illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| while he's waiting for, you know, the time to come to his neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| So we just felt, I mean, there were strong feelings about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| This has been such a diverse group that has worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| And just to respect every single neighborhood that was represented, which were over 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| it just seemed that this was the best resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| And we discussed that with the mayor, who still has his reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| But this is something that's going to be complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| It is not something where people are going to be driving about looking to find a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| And we also, I guess, need to assure council that it has been agreed that there will be no after hours enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2024)|
| 0:33:54| Because that was another concern that, I'm sorry, Dr. Lyons, I think you want to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| No, I was just going to back up what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| But also add one element that we have neglected to mention thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| and that is we're going to keep very careful records and bring within a period of time, six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| nine months time period, bring back a report on how it's working, any difficulties with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| or if it's working very well, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| We'll do an evaluation period and report and bring that back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| I'm going to go to Councilman Bateley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Mayor, tell us a little bit about the education process or the awareness process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Dr. Lyons, do you want to comment about the education process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| We're going to work very carefully with the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I know, of course, Hayes is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| And we'll know that we'll expect that this will get reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| We'll settle below the fold, but, you know, front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| And with the television stations and others to get this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Also, we know that the task force has connections with a very large number of neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| and get the word back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| And we have our own office of neighborhoods to reach out to neighborhoods all around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| I think that's the level at which the word can get out to folks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| And we have a good period of time to get that word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| I do think there will still be some difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I mean, as you know, we can do a lot of things that people, we think everybody knows about and they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| So that's part of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| I think while we have that period with the warning, I think that's part of the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| We're going to do everything we can from all the other ways we have to get information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| It's weeks isn't a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| And that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Sometimes implementation is a little stickier than we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| So that's a little bit why I said we want to have this warning period where we'll come back with reports to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and say here's what we've learned so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| And I guess these two points I wanted to bring up are not points to stop the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| but I just wanted to see if these two issues have been given any consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I'm glad to hear about the complaint driven aspect because that may settle at least one of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| that I had in this just to see if there had been any discussion about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| or maybe to put it on the radar for future discussion or consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| And I appreciate all the hard work that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| But with regards to Article 5, Section 7AI, Number 5, which I think is a great addition that deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| with the UT home football games and to how we park approved city events such as the TVA and our fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2183)|
| 0:36:32| was there any discussion at the administration level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| or the community level about, you know, local high school athletic events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| I know in some of the neighborhoods that have high schools that sit directly in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| people will pull up and their families will pull up and park in their yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| and go to the high school game and then leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And I know there's no after hours, but was there any consideration about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| And if so, how did the committee resolve itself on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| And if not, maybe that's something we need to think about in the future if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| We don't need to put that or have that be a hitch tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| And then the other part would be with regards to the actual act itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| and the possible negative impact on small lots in lower income areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| and other undeveloped areas where there are lots that aren't developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| that we try to encourage Habitat and other folks to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| and build safe, affordable housing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| And have we given any thoughts to the potential impact, negative impact on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| And if not, that's another thing I think for the future we may want to consider about how do we address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| And if there's been discussions about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| and everybody feels very comfortable with how they arrived at their decision on that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| But if not, I think those are two things that you can never bring something forward and make it perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| And that's why I wanted to say that this is not to cause anything to go back anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| I'm not asking anything to be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| But these may be two issues that as we look to the future and as amending this in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| we're kind of looking to see how we're going to deal with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| And that's just two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Barbara, Bob, do you want to talk about it or do you want to let Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Well, I just wanted to comment that there was a great deal of discussion about both points that you bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| So thank you for bringing them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| And I think Mr. Blattner is prepared to respond, and it would be good if he would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| Jim, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| I'll help you if you don't do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| I'm sure Councilman Becker will be glad to also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Oh, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Jim Blattner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Councilman Brown, those issues were discussed considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| The high school football games, obviously, we felt like that could be a city-sanctioned event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| so that it could fall under that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Obviously, it's maybe a county-sanctioned event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| but I think we could probably get the mayor to sanction particularly athletic events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| So I don't think that should be a particular problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| The low-income housing was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| It was discussed at great length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| The infill housing has their own set of guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| so that that would not be affected by this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| We had quite a bit of discussion on the Habitat situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| and Ms. Gaither brought up some very interesting points along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| In fact, I believe that it's her belief, and I don't want to speak for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| but I believe that your belief is that this will actually help the situations with the Habitat situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| because a lot of those don't have those driveways there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| So that the understanding was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| in some cases they're creating problems for neighborhoods in some of the ways that they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| So, yes, we had a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| And many of those houses that are in the small lots of records have access to the back through alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| Many of those do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| So, yes, they were considered in many of our photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| and research that was done took in those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| And I didn't mean to just say Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Let me say there's also three or four chotos in Knoxville that do the same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| And while there is a concern about some of those homes that go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| I think one of the reasons that you don't have driveways is then you turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| and drive the cost up sometimes to where the low-income family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| or the first homeowner family can't afford to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| So I'm glad to hear there was discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| And I hope that neither one of those issues are dead in case we need to bring them back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| And specifically the one about the high school athletic events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| it may be a simple fix to saying during a county, a city-approved or a county-approved event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| And they may resolve that very quickly there, you know, which is a small word change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| But I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I'm glad to hear there was discussion about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Well, I guess I wanted to just add one thing that I guess your question, Mr. Reichman, raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| While the gist of this is about banning parking in front yards except for handicapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| and temporary events and et cetera, there are also some provisions in there about location of driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| The city has required, I guess, two parking places since, I guess, the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| So houses have always had to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| What this adds is some point of saying that the driveway should not be directly in front of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| And there's a couple of different ways we do that on different size houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| by trying to move the location to the edges of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| I want to just take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| There's a wonderful drawing on your end out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| It's, I guess, section two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| And this is a computer drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| And I feel a little hurt because I know Jamie Rowe spent a lot of time doing a hand-drawn version of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| and I'm really kind of disappointed in a way that we used the computer version over her wonderful schematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| But so we have some idea of how we want things to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| And I appreciated having those examples there in the hand-drawn line to kind of see how those things work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| especially with the T driveway and the circular aspect of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| Councilman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| I wanted to call on Mr. Norman and Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| I know you were involved in this through to the very end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| and just wondered what your input in is, if you have any concerns going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| so we can be aware of that as we go forward with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| I think we're comfortable with what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| I know we also were concerned about smaller lots because we deal with that on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| and trying to issue permits and having to deal with the issues of being able to get driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| and things into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| But I think from a permitting standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| we're comfortable with the regulations that have changed relative to the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| Enforcement, I think we're all, you know, taking our best shot at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| And, you know, it's going to take a little while for us to see exactly what the impact is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| But we're certainly are willing and dedicated to trying to make this all work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| And Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| I just want to thank everyone for the opportunity to allow city representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| to work with the Neighborhood Task Force to come up with a document that we could all work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| that would be better for all the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| And I want to echo what Gary said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| Vice Mayor Brown, we did talk extensively about the small lots, no matter what neighborhood they were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| And that was one of our ñ that was really what took so long to work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| was being able to assure everyone that we had thought of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| and had found a way to allow them to have parking available on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| and not put such restrictions on them that they could not develop their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| I'm glad to hear from Dr. Lyons that there will be a very thorough follow-up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| I think tracking this for the first six months is really going to give us a better indication of how this is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| and how we can make it even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| And I think, you know, the task force, you know, we obviously are very concerned about implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| They agreed with us that this is going to be an ongoing learning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| and we'd meet and reevaluate frequently to see exactly how it is playing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| And I think they agree with us that we're all going to learn from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Mayor Haslund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Councilwoman Pelham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Well, Ms. Roddy called on very appropriately Mr. Norman and Ms. Cash to make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| I noticed Mr. King nodding his head, and I believe somewhere behind you I can almost see Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| And they both have been involved, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| So I thought perhaps they would like to make comment on the part they played in how we were able to finalize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Well, I think Gary and Anita and Brent all worked together with the group representing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2682)|
| 0:44:51| and along with Councilman Becker and Councilman Pelham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| So it was a good process, and I think we all came away with a good product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| So we're pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| And, Brent, you might want to make a comment because I think you were really a key person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| in trying to particularly work with the small lot size so that we knew that we had technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| hadn't created something that would not work engineering-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| I'm the boss, so, of course, I agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| But it doesn't work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| The piece that engineering is involved with is primarily on new permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| So any parking that has to be permitted for new lots, that's what we're involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| We did work with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Thanks for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| It was long, hard hours with us, and I know they spent many long, hard hours before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| As Steve said, we've got a product that we feel is enforceable that will allow small lots of record to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| in a manner that provides parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| So I think we're all really pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| Oh, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| We're voting on the amendment at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| To make this the item we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Terry, did you have something else you wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Can I just add that I think there's one mistake about connecting driveways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| Actually, I don't believe there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I think this is only first reading, and I asked that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| and apparently there is some logic behind it, but I figure we can talk about that in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| And then perhaps we could add county sanctioned also at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| On the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| On the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| To make this the item that we're choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| 12F is an ordinance approving the request of RECI, Russ Lewis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| for a one-year plan amendment from office to general commercial for property located on the north side of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| west of Keith Avenue, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Any questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| No, so I'd like to get that considered as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| There's a motion now on the floor to amend that to an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Any discussion on the change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Excuse me, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| If you could, Miss Lewis, if you could give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| and address particularly Mr. Becker's question of why this has to be considered on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| Certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| I'd like to address that, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| My name is Russ Lewis, 720 Pine Valley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| The reason we've asked for emergency approval on this, Mr. Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| is simply because this should have been before the council 30 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| We submitted this application in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Due to a snafu through the state and MPC, this was put off a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2878)|
| 0:48:06| We've had plenty of warning and signing on the property for any of our surrounding neighbors to take issue with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2886)|
| 0:48:17| and that's why we've asked for emergency reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Is this one that was passed by MPC before the change in the public notification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So this hasn't been here, but it has been delayed because of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| We had to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| All of the one-year plan amendments are done in the month of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| We received word about this change in the state law the last week of September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| after we had already advertised for our October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| The advertisement that we used did not meet the new state standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| so we had to postpone all of the October plan amendments to November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| and that November meeting then puts them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| We're now voting on the motion to amend this to make it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| I think I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| And, again, my sense is, and I know, Mr. Lewis, this doesn't help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| but at some level we're expecting to have two readings on law changes that have a long-term lasting impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| And I just think it's good policy to say we're going to take that time in case there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| I don't imagine I'm going to win this vote, but I will be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| I thank you for your candy cane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=2975)|

| 0:54:16| It is within the South Waterfront District that requires a planned zoning, one of several planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3256)|
| 0:54:28| That, of course, requires use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| And we've wrestled with how to deal with this, whether to pull it into the Form-Based Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| or whether to deal with it separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| At this point, we've decided to try to deal with it separately because it actually, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| there are a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| I won't go into all the details, but there's still some concerns that I have in terms of have we covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| everything we need to cover here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Now, part of that, those concerns, a good bit of that concern can be addressed through the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| on review process, which was the rationale for going to a planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| And I'm going to go ahead and I've made a motion to approve this on first reading, may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| or may not on second reading or may want to amend it or send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| But I anticipate going ahead with it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| But I just wanted to kind of give everybody a heads up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3317)|

| 0:55:39| And then I'm also going to move that this be approved on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| And Mr. and Ms. Daniels or Collins are here, and they can explain to you the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| I need somebody to second both motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3346)|

| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| It's Casey Collins, 3637 Division Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| We were supposed to be in here October the 9th for the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| but the same situation with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| We couldn't come because they had postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Also, we're wanting to replace our home, but the mortgage company will not give us our loan until we are rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| The major support beam in our house is broken in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| and with the weather the way it is now in our hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| the wall is separated this much from the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| so we don't know how much longer the house is going to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| I think it's justifiable motion for emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3399)|

| 0:57:47| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Y'all, I bet when you read your agenda you knew this was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| It's Callaghan, Old Callaghan, and it's a C4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| I think we're making significant long-term mistakes on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| The city spent a lot of money doing Callaghan Road, building a four-lane road, a commercial strip, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| There was lots of vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| It's not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| We left Old Callaghan, which is primarily still a residential street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| and we're allowing incredible commercial sprawl to go up that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| It's an old road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| It's a narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| And we're putting a highway commercial zone on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| And I think that's the wrong way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| So I think this is a serious mistake for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3507)|

| 1:02:43| And so what we've done is looked at where should we do a model city project in the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| and looked at all the states, honed in on Tennessee, looked at a number of cities in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| and decided that Knoxville is a great opportunity to do good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| Clearly, what we've seen in your track record is a lot of good work getting recycling going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| But there's lots of new technologies, lots of new ways to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| And so what we want to do is help your city staff, which that's part of the reason we picked Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| You have a great team here on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| And bring whatever we can from across the country or around the globe on what kinds of things can really increase participation in recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3800)|
| 1:03:29| So our job really is to be support for your staff, bring ideas forward, analyze things if you want a third-party analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3809)|
| 1:03:38| figure out what people think, what the impressions are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| and then come back with your city staff with a good plan that we think makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081216?start=3822)|
