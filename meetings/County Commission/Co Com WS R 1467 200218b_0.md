| 0:01:19| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=82)|
| 0:01:32| All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this early evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| Before we jump into tonight's agenda, I realize that for some of our guests here in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| and some folks who may be watching this meeting from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| depending on what subject might be on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| this may or may not be your first time actually attending a county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| But just to give you a little bit of insight on how things work, each month we have two formal meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| We have a work session, usually on the third Monday or Tuesday of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| and then we have the formal Board of Commissioners meeting the fourth Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| Sorry about those lights there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| So the purpose of tonight's meeting is we're going to make a first run through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| There are some items that we're going to be, some discussions we're going to have tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| some items that we are going to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| and some of the votes may be to send them forward to next week's meeting for the official vote there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| Some items may get passed tonight and then will appear on our consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| where they will all be voted on together at next week's Board of Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| Some other things on tonight's agenda, we have public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| I've got two speakers for that. One is Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| Tonight I want to let my fellow commissioners know that we'll probably skip around the agenda just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| simply because I know we have some guests here in the audience that have an interest in some of the items that are on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Some of those items are towards the back of agenda, so out of respect for everyone's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| we'll move those towards the front in order to give some of our guests who are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| And we do appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| We don't want to subject you to a long meeting, or hopefully not too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| With all that said, I'm going to move into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| The first item on the public forum, I want to recognize Commissioner Anders and Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| As most of you guys know, and most of the audience, I started a new job in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| and I'm very grateful for the team that we have over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| One of the things that I came in, we met one of the first people that, one of the first issues we had to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| we had somebody that was very, very real, and he's an inspiration to many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| And Michael's here for a reason, but I'm going to write him a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| And there's a video, and I hope that Drew can pull that video up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| It'll kind of give you an explanation as to why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| If you don't mind, go ahead and play the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| This is an outstanding video done by AYSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| Michael Mays, a man who has a deep, abiding love for all things AYSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| He has been an AYSO volunteer for 34 years, holding many positions, including coach, referee, regional commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=257)|
| 0:04:26| area director, section director, and he served on several task forces and commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| He was elected section director of Section 5 in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Michael worked to open lines of communication coming from the national office to section, area, and regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| During this time, training became a top priority, and running good quality programs became a focus we all readily backed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| We started hosting our own expos, and the program moved forward by leaps and bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| Under his exceptional leadership, Section 5 was awarded Section of the Year in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| Michael lives and works by a statement from Captain Jean-Luc Picard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| There is a way out of every box, a solution to every puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| It's just a matter of finding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| As we started 2019, Michael was enduring some difficult health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| Doctors had found a mass near his liver, causing him to undergo rounds of radiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| When Michael found out he was cancer-free, we all rejoiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| However, he and his family would continue to be tested, as their struggles were not over yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| His liver was not regenerating like it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| Over the summer, his health went downhill fast, and in October, he was told that he only had months to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| Michael was denied by seven transplant hospitals across the Northeast and Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| Finally, a doctor at the University of Kentucky introduced him to a colleague of theirs in Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| that had experience with Michael's issues and the cancer he had earlier in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| We almost lost our beloved friend, but God had other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| We all prayed. We all sent our love to this amazing family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| In November 2019, God answered our prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Tracy remembers getting that phone call from Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| He was crying, and she had trouble understanding him, causing her to fear the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| Michael could hardly say the words, but finally, he told her that the doctors had found a liver donor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| The good news spread, and everyone prayed even harder for this family and for Michael,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| with hopes that finally there would be a light at the end of this health trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Tracy stayed in contact with his ever-so-strong and amazing wife, Julia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| getting updated reports to deliver to section staff, national board of directors, area directors, and AYSO staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| Eventually, we got the word that the liver transplant was a success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| and now Michael's new liver is doing just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| He is a husband, father, friend, and supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| Over the years, we have all been entertained by Michael's 911 stories from his job as the 911 director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| and we can all attest that we are amazed by his everlasting positive outlook and sense of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| His fun-loving attitude even extended to times when previous area directors could not spell R-E-S-P-E-C-T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| find their way around a hotel, or figure out how to get to a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| At one point in time, we have all learned something valuable from Michael, in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| He has hosted and worked at several section games over the years as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| and Michael is the person you can talk to and you will always walk away feeling better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| either about the situation or about yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| Michael has a love for AYSO and all its volunteers that is unmatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Michael is unable to be here with us today because of the reasons we mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| but he joins us through video conference with his lovely wife, Julia, and awesome son, Brandon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| This is why we want to celebrate him as our first living recipient of the new Section 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| Michael Mays Lifetime Achievement Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Live long and prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| So, AYSO has honored Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| The video is for the AYSO Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| He is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| They named a Lifetime Leadership Award in his honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| but he has been very thoughtful to thank everybody that was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Michael, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Ruth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=527)|
| 0:08:59| Commissioners and guests, I just want to, first of all, I can't start anything without thanking God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| I was given a great gift, and I'm glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| It's a miracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| But as you'll find out here soon, I can't thank enough the support from my family, friends, coworkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=551)|
| 0:09:20| just people all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| I remember contacting Brad, and Brad and my wife talked a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| and we ran into problems with being denied by seven hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| And that's where, today, I think God puts people in your path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| and we, Brad was in contact with Knox County Benefits Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| and the person who led that up is an angel in my book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| because without her work and the work of people in that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=594)|
| 0:10:02| I may not be here, or I may be a million dollars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| I still want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| So, you know, I just want to thank my boss, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| and the people at my work really stepped up to make sure that we took care of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| So I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| He really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=623)|
| 0:10:37| In that process, Michael reached out to the mayor to thank him and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| and I think the mayor wanted to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| So, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| As the commissioner said, Michael was extremely thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| and sent me an email asking if we could publicly recognize the Benefits Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| and the head of the Benefits Department, Krista Begg, for what she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| So, Krista, can you please come down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=665)|
| 0:11:16| This is a proclamation to publicly recognize Krista Begg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| And it says, whereas Krista serves as the director of Benefits Department for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| and whereas she has demonstrated a tireless effort to ensure that all team members of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| have a sound benefits program that meets their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| and whereas under her leadership, her team has demonstrated that they will go above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| in serving all team members in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| and whereas an incredibly dedicated public servant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| she spent countless hours working to arrange a procedure for a team member that was ultimately life-saving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| and whereas the man whose life she saved has a desire to extend their gratitude publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| and whereas Knox County joins Ms. Begg's friends and family in celebrating a meaningful career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| and thanks her for her valuable contributions that she has made to her community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Now, therefore, I, Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor, do hereby proclaim February 18, 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| as Krista Begg Day here in Knox County. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=739)|
| 0:12:37| I'm really honored by this and so grateful for all of the support that we had along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| I have felt and cared for your family through this whole journey, and I'm just so glad that you're here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=764)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman. This is very important to Michael,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| and when we look through the budget and we look through numbers and we talk about insurance and benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| we don't think about the people sometimes, and this probably brings it all into perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| I thought Mike Steele or somebody wanted to get a picture of Krista, of you and the Mayor and Michael and you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=796)|
| 0:13:28| Mike Steele, you didn't want to get a picture of him at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| He tried to get one and everybody was moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| And I ran into this gentleman on the elevator. He didn't tell me who or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| and he had his Star Wars mask on, and he said, I'm not contagious, and I said, I know you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| You're protecting yourself, and he never said anything. We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| He said he lost 80-something pounds through this whole ordeal, so what a miracle and what a blessing it's been today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=832)|
| 0:14:03| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Okay, moving on. Once again, thank you, Mayor Jacobs. Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| And your story, I hope it just sets all of our hearts with gratitude, and we're just so grateful to have you with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=853)|
| 0:14:24| We really are, so you've got a lot of life's impact moving forward, and we're glad that Knox County was a part of helping you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=864)|
| 0:14:33| Next, on public forum, I have one gentleman who had called earlier and wished to speak at public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| It's Randall Hendry. Hendry, I'm hoping I'm pronouncing that correctly. Is Mr. Hendry here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=879)|
| 0:14:51| Okay, nope. All right, we do have, I believe, a second public forum as part of our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| Just as a reminder for all of our county commissioners and anyone who comes as part of our set agenda for the work sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| we always have a public forum at the beginning and at the end. We usually only do public forum at the beginning of the BOC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| so if Mr. Hendry should arrive, we'll give him a chance to speak at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| Next, we're going into the part of the meeting where we'll set the agenda, and I've got a couple of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| but I also wanted to take just a moment to thank some of the other elected officials who are joining us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| I know I saw Sheriff Tom Spangler just a few moments ago, so Sheriff, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| Sherry Witt, our county clerk, I know you're here tonight and have an interest in one of our items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Mayor Jacobs, of course. Then, as a matter of personal privilege, I've got another guest here tonight that I just want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| and let him know we're glad to have him back in the swing of things. He's a dear friend, and I love to give him a hard time consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| And Ben Sharble. I know, Ben, you've had a heck of an illness, and we're just really glad to have you back at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| doing your exciting job of reviewing contracts. So, Ben, it's good to have you back in the saddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| So, we're glad to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| So, but moving on as we set the agenda, I'll review the items, and then, as you all may have seen in the format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| a couple of comments and some stuff we want to clarify. The ads that have come to us are items 45, 46, 48, 56, and 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=973)|
| 0:16:31| Down in the zoning part, items 59 and 60 have been moved forward to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=991)|
| 0:16:42| The non-consent items are items 6, 10, 41, 3, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1002)|
| 0:17:10| 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1030)|
| 0:17:23| Are there any other items that my fellow commissioners would like to pull from consent? Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to pull number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| Have we got that? Okay, item 34. Okay, yes, Commissioner Bessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| The one that I have is number 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| I'm sorry, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to move the item that I had on there, number 57, to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| because the people that want to talk about some issues in the flooding cannot be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| Okay, and just a clarification. I know I saw that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| I know it looked like it was a question about the flooding and then a question about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Russ is here if you've got a question about the school stuff, if you wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| No, I didn't. Anything about schools. Okay, all right. Individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Okay, all right. All right, thank you. All right, so we'll move that to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| All right. Okay, next item. Yes, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| For our guest, I'd just like to move item 50 towards the front of the agenda, if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Yes, we will. And, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a question, a clarifying question about 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| Is that a question about Knox County school flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Is that an item that should go to the school board, not to Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| I just wanted some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| All right, you've addressed me, and I'll push that to Commissioner Bessel, just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| My issue was about two issues we had last year at the same time with some individuals out in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| It had nothing to do with schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Okay, all right, thank you. All right, thank you. All right, thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| All right, yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you, number 44, and I have a question about number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| All right, item 44 is to be pulled, and then you've got a question about number 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| so when we get to number 19, we'll address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| So, basically, you're saying pull 19, and you've got a question about it, just to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| So, pull 19, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Pull 19 and 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| And 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Yep, have you got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| All right, I am going to, we do have several, is there any additional changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Yes, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was just going to ask if we could move item 46 toward the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| since the clerk is here and might want to provide some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Yep, I have had several commissioners, and I know we've got a lot of special guests here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| so I'm going to bounce around the agenda tonight just for the sake of respecting our special guest time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| Is there a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| All right, we have a motion from Commissioner Gill with a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Okay, the first couple of items we're going to work on, and just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| I'm going to look at, these are items I'm going to move to the front of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| and that is regarding the roads, the hotel tax, item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| We have item number 54, item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| So that is, and please let me know, my fellow commissioners, if I've covered these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| I know there's a road item, the hotel tax, the presentation from the Board of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| and the new election system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| I think I've caught all of those where we've got guests here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| Then we'll move into the harder part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| What was that, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Was that number 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| No, I messed up, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| 50 was your road one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Yeah, 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I need to pull for Alcoa Highway if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I think we've, I think we've pulled it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Yeah, we pulled that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| So what we're going to do is we're going to effectively pull 49 and 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| although those are both readings and don't necessarily need to be pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1275)|

| 0:23:48| and a second from Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1428)|

| 0:24:02| and some from the organization that's going to build the monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1442)|

| 0:24:23| And we were approached about putting a memorial up for our servicemen and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| And in order for this to work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| according to everything that we've been told for setbacks and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| we have 190 foot of Solway Ferry Road that runs into a dead end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| that we would like to have closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| That way we have plenty of room to move everything back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| in case they do change the road out front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| That's all I can tell you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1495)|

| 0:25:13| and we're working in conjunction with the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| and with other community businesses on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| It is fully funded, and it does make a difference on our layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| and our access to the proposed site to getting closure on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| So we appreciate consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1529)|

| 0:25:35| Is there any way we can maybe get an email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| I'd love to come out to the unveiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| I'm sure other commissioners would like to, too, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1543)|

| 0:25:49| and we will have military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1549)|

| 0:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| And, sir, go ahead and approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| My name is Mitchell Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I am the property owner adjacent to this property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| I apologize to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| I just received this notice a couple of days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| so I haven't had a lot of time to look into this, understand what the church is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| And I think I understand the right-of-way that they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| I think it's a great thing that you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| I just think that the plaque that they've given us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| it shows 154 foot at the back of their, at least what they had submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| and they're asking for 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| So I just want to make sure the pins and the right-of-ways are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| I'm not opposed to closing off that portion of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| I'm going to take that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| I'm going to propose it to Mr. Snowden, who's immediately over your right shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Mr. Snowden, would you like to weigh in on this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1614)|
| 0:27:08| That's what they have proposed, the 154 at the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| But the petition says 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| I'm not specific with the details of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| but certainly I'll look into it and clarify with these two applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| and make sure that the matter is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| So my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| I'm not exactly sure how to explain that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| but I'll definitely look into it and make sure it's resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| That's the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| I just wanted to make sure that both parties know that this first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and then you'll have a second reading in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| So we've got plenty of 60 days or 45 days to get it all cleared up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| so we'll get it taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| We have a motion and a second to send it forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Next item is item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| I'm going to call on Commissioner Beeler to introduce this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| I know you're the sponsor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| And Madam Clerk, would you mind going ahead and reading the caption, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| On page 8, item number 46,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| expressing support for state legislation amending Chapter 847 of the Public Acts of 1982| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| to eliminate exclusions of short-term rental units in Knox County's hotel occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| We have a proper motion from Commissioner Beeler and a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Back to you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| This is a resolution that I've been working on with the county clerk, Ms. Witt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| who I believe is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| And I also believe Commissioner Daley has worked on this with Daniel Sanders from the Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| on this same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Now, Mr. Sanders was not able to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| So I would ask, this has to do with allowing the clerk to collect occupancy tax, hotel tax, on Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1743)|
| 0:29:13| Ms. Witt, I want to yield to her and perhaps even to Mr. Armstrong to bring some clarity to where this stands with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Go ahead, Ms. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Yes, that's exactly what we were trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| is just to amend the current law that they're talking about, the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| This is a tax that the city is already collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Not many times do you have a business, being Airbnb, calling and saying, what do we do with this tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| And so I talked to our law director, and he said, Sherry, you have to have the authority to collect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| And the charter, the way it's written right now, does not give us that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| So I appreciate Commissioner Wheeler recognizing the importance of this tax and letting us know exactly what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1791)|
| 0:30:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| And just, I guess, just more of an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| So it sounds like, tell me, y'all, and I may even look to some members of our legislative committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| you know, is there some momentum on this bill in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Do you think this is going to help push it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Kind of, if you don't mind us asking, just kind of tell us, what's the general read on the likelihood of this passing in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| Well, we're hoping that, because most of the other counties are already collecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Like I said, our city's collecting it now, and we just have to have the authority to collect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| But most of the counties are already collecting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| So we're hoping that maybe we were, had asked for an attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| We talked to Senator Massey and asked her for an attorney general opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| But our law department, we've talked several times, and our law director feels that we need to have this body to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| Bless it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Yes, to bless it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Yeah, I'm totally confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| In discussion with Daniel, and by the way, Jennifer Roach with the Knoxville Association of Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| and Jill Thompson from the Greater Knoxville Hospitality, they're here, and they can speak if they want to later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| We'll give them the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| My understanding, Sherry, was that with this talk with Daniel, that he is, he's already asked for your attorney general's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| waiting on that opinion to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| And the law director can clear this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| I was told that we can piggyback on to another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| But to do that, we may be giving up a percentage, and we may be taking on an ordinance that we don't really want part of that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1892)|
| 0:31:42| You're exactly right, Commissioner, and we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| So we want to set a 5%, the same thing that the hotels and motels are, what they have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| So I talked to Jennifer about this, and they're not, you know, just as long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| they're not wanting to get into what some of these larger counties issuing permits and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| We're just wanting to get what, again, what they called and are asking to remit to us, but we don't have the authority to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| So it's just giving that authority to us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| I agree with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Mr. Law Director, will you weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| Well, what you have before you, truthfully, is we have an AG opinion looking at the adoption of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| We also have this, it's a public act with local application, and our application excludes residencies, single-family residencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1948)|
| 0:32:38| Most Airbnbs fall into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| So we've been working with the state's legal department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| coming up with the proper words that we can amend the state statute whereby we can do ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| or have the power to tax Airbnbs, which are single-family residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| and they're working at the language to make it fit that particular industry alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| So those two things are out, and I think the attorney, I think his name's Houston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| said that he would like this body to bless the concept, meaning approve of the tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| before they move forward with amending a state statute with our local application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| so that they would be assured they're not overstepping their bounds with what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and you all don't want it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| So that's kind of where we find ourselves in the process, and I think that's where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| I've got both Commissioner Smith and Jay want to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| I'm not sure whose light came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I'll go to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| I haven't, to be honest with you, researched this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| because I figured we would be passing this without a recommendation on to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| But I'm wondering, is this something that came around because of the 1982 World's Fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| Was this a state act with a very specific element for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2048)|
| 0:34:18| Well, we have a local application that grants us taxing powers that relates to all things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| They amended the act in 1982 related to the World's Fair issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| and the act itself, which gives us the taxing power, is this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| So it's not just a local application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2074)|
| 0:34:43| It is a broader taxing authority, but our local application restricted us in terms of residential housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| Other counties do not have that restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| so we're asking for them to amend the local application whereby we can tax Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| And I think during the time a lot of people were getting into short-term rentals with the 1982 World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| but I don't know the exact legislative history on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I just know that residents are excluded from our authority to tax right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Just for clarification, these are for all short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| They could be Airbnb, VRBO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| There's several platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| And have all of those platforms been collecting, you said, 5% tax on their rentals to date for the county portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| but it's been sort of held in limbo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| All that we can go by is what has been collected from the city, by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| We don't have any way of knowing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| other than at times we have had owners that are residents of this county that have called and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| are you all collecting the Airbnb tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| And we say we do not have the authority to collect it, but the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| And Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| The question is how will this affect some of the people that are using B&Bs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| like on their farms to help supplement the farming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| Will that, there's how they race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| It's already being collected through Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Airbnb is the one that will be giving the money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| It's not a tax on any, you know, a person in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| It's usually taxed for whoever is visiting, just like in a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Just a final word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| We're going to be proactive on this and making sure the county gets our share of this tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you, Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| And Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Jill or Jennifer, you all want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Jennifer Roach, Knoxville Area Association Realtors, 609 Wise Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| So I just want to make sure that we're careful with this, that we are not permitting short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| that we're not taxing them just so that we're protecting our long-term housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| We don't want short-term rentals to take over that stock because they think, oh, well, they can tax us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| That means we're permitted because I don't believe they're exactly permitted in the county yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| So I want to make sure that we're ready to help whenever you're ready to work on those short-term rental regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| As Ms. Witt said, we're fine with the equal taxation of short-term rentals along with the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2258)|
| 0:37:46| It's important, though, that the tax assessment classifications of these properties remain the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2266)|
| 0:37:55| whether you rent it for a day, a week, three months, or a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| It's residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| It's not commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| So we want to make sure that's clear moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| But, again, and this is hyper-local regulation, so it's going to be very different than maybe what Sevier County has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| But I think we can look towards what the Steve Knoxville has and go forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| We have a – oh, I'm sorry, Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| I was beginning to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| We're so glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| A little shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Jill, that's on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Sorry, I'm a head down in paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| We're so glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I'm Jill Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| I'm the executive director of the Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| And I just want to thank you, again, for bringing this forward, for Sherry to bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| The city is collecting, the county is collecting the tax on hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| This just levels the playing field for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| We know there are competitors, but there are some – we welcome that, but we just want to level the playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| And, of course, this tax goes to market and promote the city and the county of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| And that brings in the sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| So we can all just benefit from more taxes coming to us from out of town and visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| We have a – my only final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I was just going to get back to Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| With agritourism, I don't think that the tax on this piece would not be any kind of conflict with the State Right to Farm Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| So – which I think that was where you're going on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| So – and, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I'm wondering if our next step is to study and figure out a way that we need to be permitting these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| If we're going to tax something, there should be some kind of guidelines and permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| I think we're open to discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| Maybe we can talk to Jennifer and kind of let them kind of wade in to give us some advice on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| I know tonight we're going to have to deal with the resolution at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| and then maybe take a look at that later this – you know, after we've gotten the budget passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| then maybe that might be something to take a look at in June post-budget passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| So, you know, that's my thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| In fact, Jennifer, that might be something, if you put it in the tickler file, that might be something to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| If you don't mind, maybe in June, once we've got the budget passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| I'm somewhat hesitant to bite off a big thing until we've gotten through our budget season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| So with all that said, we have a motion that is properly before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| and that was to pass it on to the – or was that to send forward no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Was that to send forward no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| No, it was to pass. It was put on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| So the motion is to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| It will go on to the consent agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| All in favor of that motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you, everybody who came out tonight for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Okay, next item is – this is pretty interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| considering our current timing with the elections happening right now – is item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| So I'm going to ask Madam Clerk if you could please read the caption for item 41,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| and then the Chair will ask for a motion and then recognize Cliff Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| So go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| This is Resolution 901, Approving a Master Agreement with Hart InterCivic Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| for the Purchase of Certain Hardware, Software, Software Support Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Warranty Services, and Professional Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| in conjunction with the acquisition of a new rugged paper-based voting solution system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Could the Chair ask for a motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| And your motion was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Is that Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| A motion for approval by Commissioner Gill and a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| We have two motions before us, and the Chair recognizes Cliff Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| Clifford Rogers, Administrator of Elections for Knox County, Office Address 300 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| Mr. Chairman and Commissioners, I've got a long version and I've got a short version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| so I'm going to start with the short version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| I hope you all are satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Back in the spring of 2016, I informed Chris Caldwell that we would need a new voting system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| within the next few years, and I suggested that we were probably talking about $2.5 to $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| But for reasons which I can't discuss in length, we began looking at a paper-based system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| or at least one with a paper trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| And, of course, a paper-based system is not as expensive on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| because there's a lot less voting equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| As a result, I informed Mr. Caldwell last winter that we were probably looking at a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| $1.5 to $2.5 million for a new paper-based system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| Now, as you can see from the attachment to the resolution before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| the total amount for this system was $1,437,354.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| By way of reference, Knox County spent $1,762,550 for a used voting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2599)|
| 0:43:32| the one we're still using, back in either 2005 or 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| So we spent more than we're now asking about 15 years ago for a used system versus this new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2618)|
| 0:43:47| Also, and this is important, the state of Tennessee currently has $930,000 of Help America Vote Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2627)|
| 0:43:57| That's the HAVA money. You hear about HAVA all the time if you're in my world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| This was set aside for the purchase of a new voting system here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| They computed $10,000 per precinct, and then they lump in a certain amount more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| for the number of early voting sites we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| That's where they come up with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| So ultimately, Knox County would only be on the hook for a little over half a billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| I think it's $507,354.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| Finally, keep in mind that this should be somewhat of a relief to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| that the Election Commission, not the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| is statutorily tasked with approving the purchase of any voting equipment to be purchased by the County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2679)|
| 0:44:47| That would be TCA 2-12-116 subpart 3, so we're the law director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| Now, the Election Commission did precisely that when they unanimously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| at a public meeting on December 12, 2019, the purchase of this particular voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| I also want to add that Commissioner Gill was in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| and actually saw the HART paper-based system demonstration and presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| I think I made it an invite to everybody and delighted that you showed up down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| So, to summarize this briefly, Knox County has the money for this competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| We are definitely under budget, and when we receive our HABA money, our grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| we will be well under budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Are there any questions that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| or do you want me to delve into the tortured history and background as to how we got here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| I've got pages and pages, and I could go on ad nauseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| so I'll just stop here and let you all pepper me with any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Well, I'm seeing your first lieutenant is encouraging you to go on a lot longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| I find that hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| So, the chair recognizes Commissioner Daley, and then we'll follow with Commissioner Jay, and then Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Cliff, where is this new system going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| And I thought when I turned that style last Wednesday that it would be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| but we're still in the old system, so when is this new system scheduled to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| We are exactly on the new track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| I had hoped, I told you all years ago, I wanted to have a new system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| so that we could use it in the city elections before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| But I forgot how long contract negotiations take when you're spending county money on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2802)|
| 0:46:50| We've been going back and forth on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| The law department's done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Charlie Sturkey's done a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| But it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| So the goal now is if you all approve the money in this contract, we can get this new system in place, I'm hoping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2819)|
| 0:47:09| at the end of March or early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| These people know in part our goal is to have this new system in place for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| I can tell you with complete certainty we will never try a new system in a presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| That would be in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| The state wouldn't let us do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| It's just a recipe for disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| So we're okay, and we're limping through this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| I mean, we're having a little more of what we call failure rate of the machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| No votes are being lost, but sometimes equipment just gives out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| And you've seen regarding the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| So this is about as quick as I could make government move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| That's about all I know how to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| I'm surprised we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I really got to thinking we may never get this done in my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| Tell us how you really feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I'll get to that shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| I have a question on a different matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| So, Mr. Chairman, if you'd come back to me after Commissioner Jay and Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Okay, will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Could you just give a short synopsis of why going to paper ballots when we have used electronic for so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| might be advantageous to our county and our election process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| Short version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Here's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| Back when we were looking at a new system, I thought we'd just upgrade what we had and get a touch screen, make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| And then we had Russian hacking, or what I call the specter of Russian hacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2924)|
| 0:48:54| Hacking into a system that is not on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| That's what everybody out there is concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Do I think we personally need paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| But what I do understand now is when you've got the experts, the so-called experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| and you've got members of both political parties, and you've got the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| and you've got the League of Women Voters, and everybody's jumping up and down wanting paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2960)|
| 0:49:28| we have no choice but to give them the paper they're hollering for out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| So, and here's something else that you can't lose sight of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| If we fail to go to some sort of paper system, I can promise you at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| either the federal government or the Tennessee legislature are just as likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| A federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| There's a lawsuit going on down in Memphis right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| If that judge says every county in Tennessee is going to have to have a paper system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| or a paper trail, you're going to have to stop what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| and instead of being proactive like we're trying to do and get ahead of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| you're going to be reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| And they're going to make you do it on their schedule, not yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| It's not going to work out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| It's happened in other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| So this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| And I agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| I want the voters to have confidence in whatever system we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| And if they have to have a piece of paper like they did 100 years ago to have confidence in it, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3038)|
| 0:50:46| But I want to make it clear that system is secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| It's air-gapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| We're not hooked up to the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| What is being attacked by the Russians and everybody else is the voter database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| which IT is doing everything they can to protect, and I have confidence in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| So that's why we are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| We don't have much of a choice, and you're going to see it going on all around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| The system that we've got here is used in Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| It's used in other large metropolitan areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| So we think we're going to be fine with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| So I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| I can give you more if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| I feel like I'm at an election church right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| This is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Preach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you very much for the quick explanation, and I think everyone has great confidence in your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you for being proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Next, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| We appreciate your work, and I was there at the rollout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| But could you speak just briefly to the process of training and the capacity to serve the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| so that they can understand what's about to occur and the time frame associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| Because the level of work and the company that we are about to vote on that was selected in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| since I was at the training, I think we need to just make sure the public is aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| and we appreciate the work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| And let's be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Hart InterCivic is the same manufacturer that we've got of the equipment now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| and that's good because we don't have to learn a new language, new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| but we have the same language as opposed to if we'd had another vendor out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| So as I mentioned earlier, we're trying to get it in here March, April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| Hart will send what they call a project manager down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| probably stay a week here in Knoxville as we get rid of all of the old equipment and absorb all of the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| They will have train-the-trainers classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| I envision after we get up to speed on the new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| that we're going to take it out into the community at community events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| But keep in mind that from the voter's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| it doesn't get any simpler because the voter's going to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| we're going to look them up in the database like we do now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| and then we will provide the ballot to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| So they don't have a piece of voting equipment they go on to record their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| They're going to go over there and sit at a little table in their little privacy booth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| mark their little ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| They can figure that out pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Then they're going to take it and bring it over to a scanner, put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| It's going to record the vote right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| And if there's a problem, if they left out a race or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| it will say you failed to vote in these races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Do you wish to record your vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| or do you want to take your ballot back and add it to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| And if they want it to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| then they're going to have a piece of paper dropped down in a bin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| so that we have that piece of paper to compare to the numbers on the mobile ballot box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| which is what we're using now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| So for the voter, it's about as basic and essential as you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| You get a piece of paper, you vote it, and you put it in the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| And we'll be there to help if they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| but if the scanner's set up where the voter can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| because they don't want somebody to see the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| that's the big complaint about the paper ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Just real quickly, is there any value on the antique system that we have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| to any other entity around the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Well, they gave us a credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| It's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| It seems like it might be a couple hundred thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| but there's a number in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Okay. That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Which they reduced their price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| And see, Hart was the only one that was in a position to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| because it's absolutely worthless to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Right. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| I think Commissioner Jay has a quick question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| and then we'll finish with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Is the system that we would be purchasing with this a new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| or a used one as previous, as we did before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Oh, no. We're getting a new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| I don't want any used equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| And keep in mind, too, the most complicated piece of the system will be the ADA device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| Somebody that has a disability who wants to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| we will have those or ballot marking devices for those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| which they will produce that ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| And that's going to be the most complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| But, no, this is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| At such a good price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Back to you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Today, when it was raining, I was sitting there watching the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| and Senator Kelsey brought up an issue of votes being counted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| absentee votes being counted before 8 o'clock or 7 Central time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| And he had some tweets where they showed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| A couple of counties had counted early absentee votes at, like, 4 o'clock in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| but they didn't release them until, like, 8.01 or 8.02 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| I think he's trying to clear it up that you cannot count until 8.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| Is that how we do it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| That's exactly how we do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| We don't know on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| Of course, it's always the absentee ballots, and the nursing homes are all in that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| We've got those way before the polls close, but those are not pushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| We don't even know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| We don't even put them on the system, the tally system, where we can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| But there's been a lot of talk also in the legislature about releasing those totals at 8.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3417)|
| 0:57:06| even if we're voting people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| And I don't particularly like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| I don't want to release any totals until everybody's through out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| because you worry about, well, if they hear what the total is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| well, they'll not be interested in voting or standing in line because the race is over in a given one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| But we don't do it, to answer your question straight on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| We're going to wait until after 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| We're going to wait until after everybody is through voting until I'm reasonably assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| that there's nobody voting before we release those absentee and early votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3456)|
| 0:57:45| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Madam Clerk, remind me, who made the motion and second on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Grant Anders. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| This motion for approval was to send forward or just for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| Approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| All right. Just verifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Okay. Commissioner Gill made the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| It was seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| The motion was to approve this, which will place it on our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| Thank you so much, Mr. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| I'd also like to thank and recognize Mr. Davis, who is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| So thank you to both of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| He's the guy that does all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| That's the way it operates in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| All right. I'd like to, Madam Clerk, we could start getting on to the rest of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| unless I've got another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| All right. We've got the housing inventory one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| All right. That's our next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| We've got Item 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Madam Clerk, if you would please call the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Presentation of the State Housing Inventory and Affordability in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| by Jennifer Roach, Knoxville area of realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| And Commissioner Jay, would you mind introducing her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| I know this is something you brought to us. Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| We've had a lot of discussion over the last, well, jeez, for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| we've had discussion, but especially in our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| and some of the more contentious issues in zoning lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| we've had a lot of discussion about house inventory and home prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| and affordability and, you know, add your number of catchphrases to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| And the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors is a really great resource amongst many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| and I reached out and asked Ms. Roach if she could just come talk to us about housing inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3579)|
| 0:59:46| and how that might have an effect on our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| And hopefully the discussion and the information presented will help us better understand how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| when we talk about zoning and approvals and how fast we're growing as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| So I asked her to join and give us a little report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| So thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you. I appreciate the invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| And pardon if I cough. I'm dealing with some allergies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| I know I've talked with Commissioner Jay and a lot of other commissioners here about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| We've got some hauls up here just if you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| Okay. I'll just ask for it. You can toss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I'll toss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| We've talked about the housing market informally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| but I wanted to bring you some formal information, and thanks again for the invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| So what I'll go over first, I just want to talk about, kind of define what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| I'm here to talk about market rate housing between a private buyer and a private seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| Government bought unless there's maybe a government-backed loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| We're not talking about affordable housing that's subsidized through government programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| like Section 8 and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| These are the housing markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Talking about single-family homes and also attached homes, townhouses, condos, pubs, those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Not talking about rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| We have a great apartment association here if you need their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| This is our information from our multiple listing service, our MLS service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| and we capture a good upper 90s percentile of all the sales in the county, especially in the more urban counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| We don't capture refinances or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| So that's where we may be off from the Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| When I talk about new construction, those are not permit starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Those are not construction starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| These are actually new construction homes that were sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| So when you take a look at this little handout, I want to talk about these stats and then put them in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| So this is for Knox County for 2019, for this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| We basically had new listings, homes that hit the market for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Homes and condos were flat from 2018 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| New sales were flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| New construction, though, we saw an uptick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| It was up 9% over 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| And it was 6% of all sales there in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| And when we're talking about the county, I mean everything outside of city limits, not in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| And mostly not in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| I do capture a little bit of Farragut, but 37934 zip code is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| What I want to get to, it is a fast market, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| Days on market, same as 2018, 41 days on market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| That's pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Usually we see somewhere between 60 and 80 is normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| The bottom two blocks there, the median list price for a home in Knox County is $287,000 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| I don't know what price maybe you had in your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| If you thought it was a little higher, a little lower than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| Median sale price was $244,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Those are up almost 6% over the year before, over 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| In a normal healthy market, you're going to see that increase not at around 5.7% or 6%, but around 2% or 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3767)|
| 1:02:56| So the prices are spiking pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Price per square foot, what can you get for that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| How much does it cost to build a house or to buy a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| It was up almost the same amount, 5.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Again, that should be 1%, 2%, 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| So prices are rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Now, you may think, well, newsletter listing is flat, homes flat, home sales flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| You know, well, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| I mean, it's not growth, but it's not decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| And I don't think we're going to see a decline this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| I think we'll see the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| It will continue to go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| But when you look at the trends, and you guys don't have this printout, but I'd be happy to get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| The listings, the number of homes hitting the market, have been on decline since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| And the number of sold listings has been on the rise since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| So you have supply decreasing, demand increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| We all know what that does to prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| The average listing and sales price has been on the rise as well since 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| The average days on market, how fast homes are selling, have been getting faster and faster since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| And, you know, the one thing that has been getting faster, or we're getting more of, which is good, is we're getting more new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3839)|
| 1:04:08| New construction sales have been on the rise since 2011, and, interestingly, fell since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3848)|
| 1:04:18| They fell to 2011, and then we've been on the uptick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| New construction market share, though, even though we've been getting more and more, you know, we're increasing the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| it still stays somewhere between 8% and 10% in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| So we still have all this demand coming up, but still new construction is only about 10% of what we see hit the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| I want to compare Knox County to some of the other municipalities in the region and right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| The city of Knoxville has an average sales price of $165,000, sorry, a median sales price of $165,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3888)|
| 1:04:58| much lower than the median sales price in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| We've got a lot of home stock in the city and a lot of smaller homes, which is going to bring that price down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| However, when you look at the price per square foot, the city of Knoxville and Knox County are right on par with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| So they split the difference between about $2 apart there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| The town of Farragut has a much higher median sales price at $390,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| and they have a much higher price per square foot at $129 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| So I think those are some challenges that we have in our market is that the market is hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| It's been hot for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| It's getting really difficult to find housing that's affordable and have really good housing choice out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| There's a lot of competition, a lot of buyers, and competition for homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| So with that, I want to give you some solutions or some ideas to those challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| and we're always here to dig deeper into your district, into zip codes, to help with myself and mostly with our members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| They're the bigger experts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| So I would encourage you to be radical with this because I look at a healthy housing market and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| well, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| How do you define a healthy housing market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| And I think you should be able to be born, live, and die in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| and find generally affordable housing choices there for every part of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| You're going to have some issues here and there, but you should be able to grow up in your family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| find an apartment for college, find that first home that you want, be able to move up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| be able to downsize when you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| It's a very traditional road that I gave you there, but you get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| So some solutions that I have because I'm really concerned with the median income that we find here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| and what teachers make, what emergency responders make, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| If we want our teachers and the people that work here in Knox County to live here and in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| and add to that community and be really, really focused in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| and not be commuters from another county where maybe it's cheaper to buy a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| because we are more expensive than a lot of the areas right around us, we need to do some things about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| And so I would encourage you to talk to us, realtors, developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| Talk to your crack staff at the county and at the Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| Find out what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| I can tell you what a teacher, you know, you give me the median income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| we can find out, you know, the range of housing that has to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| Talk to developers. Talk to folks that are out there and say, are you building it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| No. Why not? What's in the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| There's some financial things that could be put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| making sure that the county is maximizing local, state, and federal resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| Cliff mentioned some money at the state that we're bringing in for the voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| Those are important, but also non-financial incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| Things like looking at every layer of regulations and everything that we have in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| and asking developers and the planners and staff what's working, what isn't, what's standing in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| So some examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| The plan development that we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| What would help get us more diverse housing choices out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Would it be expanding the plan development into the rural area that the growth policy plan says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| Would it be reducing that 10-acre minimum lot size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| Five or making no minimum lot size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| You know, your zoning code is your opportunity code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| What opportunities does Knox County have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| It has the opportunity to grow out in sprawl and in low density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| and that's going to be very expensive for infrastructure and for a sales tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| and expensive for homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| So, you know, looking and seeing can you put ADUs in your backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| If you have the right size house, can we have all those housing options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Looking at infrastructure priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| Can't have it all all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| I love it, but we can't have it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| When we talk about infrastructure, where are the priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| Well, if we want to have housing diversity, we want to have diversity of lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| and diversity of densities and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| then we've got to look and make sure that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I would think one of the examples of infrastructure priorities that should be looked at is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| where do we have to put septic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Because if you put in a septic system, you're required to have a huge lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| That's a huge land cost, which is already going to prop up the price of that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| So can we expand sewer into areas along maybe along corridors and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| You want to put, you know, your infrastructure where it's going to be economically feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| and for the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| I don't want to be, you know, penny wise and pound foolish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| but that's just an example of the infrastructure priority and where we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| And where you're going to put in that sewer, make sure that your zoning code goes along with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| and you're going to be able to put in the right type of mixed use development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| That's also looking at flexibility and options in your zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| Can you do mixed use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Do you have to just do single family homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| How far do they have to go to get to commercial development and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Could you do pocket neighborhoods or condensed neighborhoods or compact neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| that are maybe walkable right next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Look at other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Other cities have housing czars and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Czar can kind of be a bad name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| I'm, you know, very American and non-czarish here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| But, you know, being radical about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| I mean, you've really got to do something and look at it top to bottom and make it a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| because if we don't do it now, we're going to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| big, big problems with affordability in four or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| And I really like my kids' teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| I want to keep them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| You know, we have some challenges with infrastructure as far as transit goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| So if you can get to transit, you know, you can reduce your commuting costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| and things like that with owning a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| So those are we can maybe find areas where we can put more dense development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| that's closer to transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| Other things that are kind of standing in the way that I want to make you aware about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| and these cluster mailbox units, I know we've heard about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| Cluster mailboxes are taking up buildable land and lots, especially for larger subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| And I know I just saw in the last week there are some other cities in Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| and Western Tennessee who are kind of joining the coalition in their counties as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| asking the state political pressure on the USPS so that they keep cluster mailboxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| out of single-family development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| They're appropriate in some places, but we need to keep them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| And the other thing that's standing in the way, and I've talked with Doug Gordon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| who is an attorney for the county, and it might be the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| and I'm sorry if I get that wrong, tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| When the county buys back a property because of tax sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| basically state constitution and laws mandate that the county give the buyer of that a quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| And so you really can only sell that to a cash buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| and that cash buyer really has to hang on to it for a good 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| They can sell that to a normal buyer with a mortgage loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| So I really encourage you to talk with the folks at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| if there's anything we can do to get all that untapped potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| because there's hundreds if not thousands of tax sales sitting in our cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| and our counties that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| The other thing to look at with tax sales that's a form of infill development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| is to make sure that if there's a house that's raised or there are lots that are vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| that we can go back and put something in there that's a little more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| And a couple stats that I wanted to, that are not mine, but that are very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4368)|
| 1:12:57| I'm sure you've all seen from the TPO the regional commuting patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| I would take a look at that and not only that, but the trends of that over the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| and see how many folks are having to live outside our county and come in for the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| And the other thing is the density of our area has actually, and this is also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| this is from the Census Bureau, but I got it from a TPO presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| is that the density of Knox County is really only two people per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| And so we have a very low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| And I'm not saying that we need high density everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| but we do need a good, healthy, diverse diversity of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| And I would encourage you to be radical about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| And we're here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I have rambled on enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you very much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| That concludes that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Now what I'd like to do is get back, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Go back to the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Go back to the beginning of the agenda and start working our way through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| So, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| On page one, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| honoring Judge Charles D. Susano, Jr., for his 25 years of service in the Tennessee Court of Appeals, Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| Motion to stand without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| We have a motion to send forward no recommendation by Commissioner Anders with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Page item number 10, page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| Approving a commitment letter with Ford Next Generation Learning for exploration of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Ford NGL model to assist high schools in developing pathways to industry certifications at a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4485)|
| 1:14:53| of $24,990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Resolution 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| We have a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| And a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| If Russ or if anybody is from the schools here, I'm the one who actually pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I'm the one who actually pulled this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| When I read about it, it just seemed, frankly, pretty interesting, and it looked like a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| to help with both some of our CTE learning as well as traditional learning path for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| different kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| So if you wouldn't mind, just for the benefit of this body and the public at large who may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| be watching, just share a little bit more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| And thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| My name is Keith Wilson, and I'm the Career and Technical Education Director for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| So to give you a little bit of context on sort of how we got exposed to the model, Ford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| Education Learning is a group that does a lot of work through one of the larger CTE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| kind of think tanks, if you will, and advocacy bodies, which is ACTE, sort of the big national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| leader, I guess, in professional development and advocacy with career and technical ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| And they put on a conference each year, and I was able to attend one of those conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| back in 2018 and sat in some sessions with Ford where I was learning about the ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| they really come in and work with communities to arrange partnerships and build connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| with schools between both private industry and civic bodies to support the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| the schools are doing around career and technical ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| And I came back kind of excited about that because that was really current to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| we were having about lots of different things we were doing in the school district about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| the importance of partnerships and having strong frameworks for what that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| and building those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| So in coming back, I learned after the fact that actually the career academies and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| partnerships and things that they do, one of their kind of most recognized locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| for that is Nashville, the Academies of Nashville model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| So the 12 zoned high schools, not the magnet campuses, but the zoned high schools in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| are all set up with these career academies that are built upon the Ford model for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| And essentially what it does is it gives every kid in the school in those zoned high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| schools a CTE focus where they follow a track in the school according to a career pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| Those career pathways are developed and designed according to the economic and workforce demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| of the region that you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| So again, if you've got a lot of opportunity, let's say like in health sciences, then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| would expect for there to be a larger number of programs that would align to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| And it's kind of that ratio of kind of how many programs can we lift up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| So Nashville has been a community that's been doing this for I think 10 to 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| And they started in a place and building their model for academies with kind of a very high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| need because they were looking at a high school graduation rate of about 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| And it was actually driven from the outside by some industry folks and some government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| leaders to say we need to do something to transform our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| And so that's when they really started into that work was out of that notion that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| had to get their graduation rates up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| So Ford has come along and been a good partner in that work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| And now 10, 12 years down the road, they do a lot of visits and allow people to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| and they host and allow people to come visit and see the model at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| So we've taken at this point three high schools, some small leadership teams from the high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| schools down to Nashville just to see the academy structure, how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| We're taking another trip in March where we're taking an additional high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| So we'll have had four that have gone to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| On that particular visit, we actually have someone going from the mayor's office in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| chamber as well with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| And what this contract that you have represents really is what they consider to be phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| And they refer to it sort of as the dating phase of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| They come in and spend two to three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| They meet with folks in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| They meet with school board members, probably folks from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| We'll kind of help to help point them into some folks, the chamber certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| But those that they feel like from a community standpoint would be key players and be instrumental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| in this work taking off in an area in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| And after that visit, they provide back feedback to the district to say this is where we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| you are and whether or not they believe that community right now is a good fit for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| And from there, you can make decisions and plan on if you want to go on to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| But to your point before, it really is about ensuring that students get a deep experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| both in the academic side and in the technical skill development side of their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| in recognition of the fact that in today's modern world and economy, you need both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| You need the technical skills as well as the exposure to workforce and career just as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| as you need the academic enrichment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| Well, just a follow-up question, at its simplest, is this the tip of the iceberg in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| the opportunity to expand this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| What you're saying is very much a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| I've heard from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| I've heard this from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| And as we see, there's so many open jobs just here in the community for CTE that need folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| with that focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| So is there opportunity to grow this or even to grow it through different funders besides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| the Ford Foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| So, and Ford, I mean, they don't really pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| I mean, you're essentially paying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| But what you're paying them for is consultation for professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| The framework they follow really comes in from a school standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| It's the organization, the community, and pieces to tie back into the programs that are selected there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| But it's also training the teachers in these academies so that they learn how to teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| through the lens of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| So if I'm teaching English or science or math, I learn how to teach that and incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| projects and things to where I'm enriching what the students are learning in their technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| skills courses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| To say it's the tip of the iceberg, what I would say is as far as this contract goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| it's the first step just to see, again, where we are as kind of an asset inventory as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| But everything that their work stands for is the direction that we're being asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| look, both from the state in terms of ready graduate and early post-secondary opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| for students, industry certifications, expansion of work-based learning opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| One of the key components, no matter the model that Ford has got in their 40-plus communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| one of the key components is that you have students interacting with folks from industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| in an ongoing fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| That can be everything from class speakers to me going out and doing a paid internship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| type placement as a high school student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| And we're certainly being asked to look for opportunities to expand that type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| So there's nothing in the work that Ford does that is misaligned with either our goals as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| a district or really where we're being asked to look to use those federal funds as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Are there any other questions from my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Okay, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you for that insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| On page three, item number 19 is a resolution approving an antigovernmental memorandum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| understanding and agreement by and among Knox County, Tennessee, the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| the Mayor of Knox County, the Knox County Board of Education, and the Director of Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| regarding the relocation of the administrative offices of the Knox County Schools from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| Andrew Johnson Building to the TVA East Tower Resolution 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| Okay, can I have a motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Okay, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| Okay, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| I can't remember who pulled this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Was that you, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| Sorry, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| You said you had a couple of questions about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| And I know we have some connected pieces to just make sure the public understands the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| TVA deal was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| We're on the school board resolution that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| We're at the third component of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| And my one question was, can this MOU be executed with Knox County if the agreement with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| TVA deal hasn't been finalized and if those dates will be in conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| That was what my clarifying question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| And it may be more appropriate to the superintendent so that the public understands the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| that we're following from us first to the school board to the third component of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| MOU between us and the school system and if we are still on target with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| I know that Superintendent Thomas, I know, is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| He's at the recognition event for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| That may be something when – I'm just trying to salute because this is in the – yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| Russ is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| But we'll go ahead and have Russ address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| Let me make sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| And I may have to defer to the law director on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| But as I understand this agreement, it consents to the MOU provided that one of three conditions is met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5031)|
| 1:24:02| And that is, one, that we get an affirmative opinion back from the state attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5042)|
| 1:24:11| or we get a change in the current legislation to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| or that there is approval from the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| So having – if it meets any one of those things as approved by the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| this process can go forward that the board has agreed to that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| Did that answer your question or was it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| I just wanted some clarification on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Mr. Law Director, did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| That's what you all agreed to, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| That motion is before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| On page 7, item number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5097)|
| 1:25:08| Was 34 pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| 34 was pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| So, Madam Clerk, we'll go to item 34, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5114)|
| 1:25:22| That was regarding the traffic points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| On page 6, item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| It's a resolution approving a local agency project agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| with the Tennessee Department of Transportation for the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| ATMS Phase 2 project for traffic signal upgrade to 15 intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| including Meadowville Highway, Cedar Bluff Road, East Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| Norris Freeway, and Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| with an estimated project cost of $1,547,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| No local match required resolution 412.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Could I get a motion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Everybody said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| Mr. Schoonmaker, I'll recognize you with the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| and Mr. Smith with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| So, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| Mr. Snowden, I'm guessing you may have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| I wanted Jim Snowden to kind of give us a quick overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| since this is vital to many of the districts here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| and just kind of walk us through and tell us what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| Yeah, this is a FASE grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| So, this body approved FASE 1 five or six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| This grant will actually supplement some of the cost overruns we've had in FASE 1 due to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| TDOT had made some changes midway through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| and required us to change the scope a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| So, this grant is 100% fully federally funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| so the county will not have any dollars in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| We tried to choose the highest traffic corridors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| Cedar Bluff, Manorville Highway, Emory Road, Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| where the majority of our traffic exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| As far as the construction of these go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| it will be a full upgrade to new high-tech controllers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| real-time cameras that we'll be able to monitor in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| very much like what TDOT has at their traffic information system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| We'll be able to real-time change traffic patterns at the signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| at all these intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| So, there'll be a big significant increase in efficiency at these signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| and all of that's being funded by a TDOT grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| So, we're very supportive of this and think it's a good thing for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Any additional follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Yes, I noticed in the contract that it says it has to be completed by January 31st of 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| And, of course, now we're in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| Do you anticipate this to move quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| or will this be delayed because of funding or whatever until 2023, 2024, or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| I think we've worked out the kinks over the past three or four years with Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5280)|
| 1:28:08| So, all the utility make-readies and we had some ADA hang-ups too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| So, I think we've got through those, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| and I would anticipate us being able to complete both phases within the timeframe of audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5295)|
| 1:28:22| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| And, Jim, I might add, we've talked about this in TPO as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| There's some absolutely fascinating, I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| it may have been a contract for the software provider several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| to get some of the software to help track these continuous traffic patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| but it's very fascinating and definitely a good thing for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| to see us investing in these traffic systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| which can change them in real time, see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| It's very smart stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| All right, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Okay, this motion is probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Page 7, item number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| Okay, could I have a motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| All right, a motion for approval and a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| Okay, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| I'd like to introduce Mr. Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Gene Burr is from the Lakemore Hills Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| and this group has done a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Back last summer, Gene, I think we did a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| Charette, pronounce that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| of a commercial along the new section of Governor John Spear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| City Council last week approved their portion on the city part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| And just a quick note, and I'll turn it over to Gene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| the new entrance at Maloney Road going north to just past the shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| past Court South is still county, lies in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| and the rest of this is inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| So Gene's got a short little slideshow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| So, Gene, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Well, thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| It's a pleasure to share with you a few of the details of this long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| and difficult and challenging path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| I was part of the, I guess I need to provide my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| It's 3621 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| In the 1980s, I was part of a conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| Tennessee Department of Transportation about Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| At that time, accidents were running at a pretty high pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| You can imagine the highest volume artery in the entire state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| apart from the interstate system, 58,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| In the 1980s, when we first had this conversation with DOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| it was running about 35,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| So you can see both the speed and the volume of traffic has increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| significantly over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| I will just mention that Carson mentioned that we had a charrette,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| and that is a stepping stone to this plan that we're asking you to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| A charrette is a term that's familiar to planners and architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| It's actually a French name for the little cart they use to haul the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| together at the end of a project, that intensive effort to wrap up a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| So it's common use as a brainstorming session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| That's what this was in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| The reason for that charrette or brainstorming session came out of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| conversation that I had with your planning director, Gerald Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| I said, Gerald, we're going to have to get our act together on what we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| this corridor will become after DOT gets through with the construction in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5537)|
| 1:32:24| It was too important to leave it to chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| We had lost businesses over the years, reduced essentially a viable commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| area to a few businesses that didn't provide groceries, didn't provide gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5555)|
| 1:32:44| no restaurant, there was a subway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| You'll see the details in just a moment, but I want that impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| to stay with you because that undergirds the whole reason for doing a decent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| plan on this area today so that it can become a new opportunity for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| and maybe restore some of those activities that we've lost over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Okay, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| This is the plan of the entire Alcoa Highway Corridor, 13 miles from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5593)|
| 1:33:20| Tennessee River Bridge to the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| Coming down from the north to the south, the first major section is the section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5605)|
| 1:33:32| that fronts on the UT Medical Center, and the next section is this section that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| we're talking about tonight from Woodson Drive to Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| Then the next section will be the first section in Blount County starting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| Little River going south, and then you get into the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| There are actually seven sections the way DOT has carved this up to make it doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5635)|
| 1:34:04| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| These are the major nodes or intersections in this section that we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| At the top, you see the greenway identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| That's a major plus, and I applaud the city and the county for collaborating on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5658)|
| 1:34:27| carrying this greenway from the Tennessee River Bridge around the edge of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| Fort Loudon Lake coming into the north part of this project and carrying it through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| project as part of the highway corridor improvement, and then from there on south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5681)|
| 1:34:49| into Blount County and eventually to the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| That's a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Since I bike, I particularly appreciate that kind of opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| Coming down further, you have Montlake Drive is the first major intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| then Mount Vernon Drive, and then down to Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| This is a rendering illustrating what the corridor will look like not only after it's completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5712)|
| 1:35:21| but after it is landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| This is looking south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| Montlake Road is in the immediate foreground, and then you have the bridge across going into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5730)|
| 1:35:37| Martha Washington Heights and then further on down the bridge across at Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5737)|
| 1:35:44| As you can imagine, in a mile and a quarter of highway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| costing approximately $72 million for that mile and a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| it's because of the bridges and some 10 retaining walls that range in height from 10 feet up to 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5756)|
| 1:36:07| It's a very complex, difficult terrain to build in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| I think from my perspective anyway, knowing the problems associated with the unsafe roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5772)|
| 1:36:25| particularly peak hour problems, people would sit for extended periods of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| trying to get out onto the highway to go northbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| If you haven't had that experience, you've missed something unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5794)|
| 1:36:42| So I appreciate the complexity of the project in order to make it a safe road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| But there's a tradeoff there, and I'll get into this a little bit more in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| The tradeoff is that in order to create a system of roads that would serve this little commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5813)|
| 1:37:02| they had to build frontage roads that would be accessed at only one point in the middle of this complex and at each end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5822)|
| 1:37:16| That makes it very difficult for those businesses that are either there and have survived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| or those businesses that we're trying to attract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| So in order for that to be successful, the plan that we're asking you to support is absolutely essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| This gives you really a good idea of the amount of vegetation removal required for the six-laning of this highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5856)|
| 1:37:47| It started out in 1939 as a two-lane highway, and in 1963 it went to four lanes, and now it's going to six lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5867)|
| 1:37:56| But if you add the six lanes at 12 feet per lane plus the frontage roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| you've got an easy 150 feet of right-of-way there that's being disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| All those trees are lost, and the resulting appearance certainly leaves a lot to be desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5888)|
| 1:38:17| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| This is just a quick shot of the landscaping that the neighborhood associations have helped finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5900)|
| 1:38:29| along with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| I think the city of Knoxville was impressed with the extent of neighborhood initiative in getting this off the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5912)|
| 1:38:41| and so the city has put in $60,000 for landscaping and persuaded DOT to do the soil preparation for that landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5921)|
| 1:38:51| So it's a great collaboration in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5934)|
| 1:39:01| This bridge across at Martha Washington Heights, the additional landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| This is at Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| You have two roundabouts, one on the east side and one on the west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| which provide a better flow of traffic and will be a focus of the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5959)|
| 1:39:28| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| These are the major intersections again, but this allows you to see the commercial area there in the pink coloration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5971)|
| 1:39:41| commercial area on the east and the west, which is the focus of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| that we're asking the planning commission to update before the construction is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5986)|
| 1:39:54| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| This is the area that is served by this highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| As you can see, there's about 7,500 residents in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| This essentially is going from the river bridge to the Little River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| Plus you have the 58,000 cars a day that are traveling the roadway, median age, interestingly, at 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6016)|
| 1:40:25| so it's a younger population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| And you can see there's the income levels that are projected in this demographic profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| that are reasonable to support the new businesses that we hope to attract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| And this is the sort of thing that any developer is going to be interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| is what is the demographic profile of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| And so part of the work that we did in preparation for this brainstorming session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| was to get this profile, which we appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| We usually do five minutes for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| So if you don't mind, let's start to try and wrap it up quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| This is an awesome story, and I'm glad Commissioner Daley brought you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Carson told me between five and ten minutes, so I'm not going to put that off on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| I'll try to wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| But there are some things that I do want to bring to your attention, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| This is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| These are all the businesses that we used to enjoy in that area that have closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| We haven't had a grocery store in seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| All of the gas stations have pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| These are the surviving businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| As you can quickly see, these do not include any grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| This is a survey that we did, as your resolution suggests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| It was important for us to get feedback from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| We got over 600 responses from this survey that the Community Design Center assisted us in getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| As you can see, the high-premium items are the grocery stores, the gas stations, and the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| Once again, let's try to get to the wrap-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| I want to also compliment Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| I actually attended some when he served as a big part of the severe corridor study that has got some great results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| You're working with somebody who's got a lot of experience in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| You can better believe I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Let's try to wrap it up very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| Then we may have a couple of questions, and then we can move on with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| I think we get what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| Let's flip through these additional slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| I'll see if there's anything there particularly significant that I need to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| Unhealthy corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| This is a concept that was established by the National Planning Research Operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6176)|
| 1:43:06| This is common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| These are the kinds of things you need to build into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| This is an unhealthy corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6195)|

| 1:43:21| You've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| This is Alcoa Highway as you see it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6203)|

| 1:43:31| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| Signage is particularly critical because this area of commercial activity is going to be isolated by the height of the walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6214)|
| 1:43:44| in addition to the frontage road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| These things are absolutely essential, and this is what we can build into that area to create the potential that we hope to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| But signage is particularly critical, and we're pushing DOT to give us access to the logo sign system, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6235)|
| 1:44:05| that they use on the interstate system as a means of giving drivers notification before they actually get into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6245)|
| 1:44:15| and then can't see it because of the height of the barrier walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| I wanted to mention I gave you this little brochure, which we put out to the community when we got our landscape plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6260)|
| 1:44:28| In addition to the 20 businesses and agencies and organizations that endorsed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| I wanted to mention that we got an endorsement from the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| which is your 16-county planning organization, and the Knox County Legislative Delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| I guess this was to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| You're asking the MPC to do a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| Is there a funding requirement included in this, and what actually is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| Because in the brochure it talks about $300,000 for landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| Landscaping is completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| No, my question was to Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| There's no funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Gerald Green is the MPC Commissioner for Knox County Planning is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| And Gerald can answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| There's no cost to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I don't think there's any cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| And the landscaping is all donations by the homeowners and by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Can he just come on the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| Mr. Green, or Gerald, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| Gerald Green, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| That would be covered in our normal budget allocation from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| What part of Alcoa Highway is inside the county's jurisdiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| And is that question addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I'll try to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| The city limits go to the county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| The city limits meander along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| For lack of a better word, they meander along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| There are some developments where some of the properties, buildings are in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| some are in the county outside of the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| It's a classic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| But the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| It's a classic Victor Ashe annexation from Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| But the city annexed all of Alcoa Highway all the way to the Blount County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6384)|
| 1:46:31| That's for the properties adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| It meanders along those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| I mean, but you're doing a corridor study in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| Why does the county, I mean, they own the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| But this affects the properties adjacent to the corridor and it's to try to prepare development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6402)|
| 1:46:50| regulations to incentivize development along those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6415)|

| 1:46:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| From Maloney Road going north, you had the cargo station, the dentist, the doctor's offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| the auto repair, Court South, the Hardee's, and the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| That's all county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| They are still in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Not saying that they would want to be inside the city, but they're all in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| Gene, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6437)|

| 1:48:05| I ask Chairman Nystrom just to give you a brief introduction to the resolution that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| And I'd like to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6487)|
| 1:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| So, in 2015, we issued letters of intent to gauge the information that the community might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| want to see happen to the, when I say the community, we're talking about developer community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| With the building in question, we received seven responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| Five of those were from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| One was from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| One from Birmingham, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| The range of their interest was everything from affordable housing to variable mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| Following up on that, a couple years later, in April of 2017, we issued an RFP for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| sale and redevelopment of the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| That RFP closed in July of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| We received seven responses again on the sale and redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| Three proposers were from Knoxville, one from Nashville, one from Memphis, one from Columbus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| Ohio, and one from Indianapolis, Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| All of the submittals proposed a mixed use with variables of multifamily apartments, condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| branded hotel rooms, retail, and even a venue space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| The RFP was evaluated by a five-member committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| Those included Blaise Birch with JA Fielding Company, which is a construction firm, Kristen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6580)|

| 1:49:56| The evaluation committee, four out of five had the proposal from B&A as rank number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6596)|
| 1:50:04| The fifth evaluator had a difference of one point when we added the pricing component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| It was unanimous that B&A would be awarded the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| February 13th, we had a walkthrough of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| A couple of commissioners were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6624)|

| 1:50:31| They joined as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| We were able to show we started at the main level, went to the basement of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| and then went all the way to the rooftop, and then worked our way down through the floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| I think we were able to show the inefficiencies of space in the building, the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| It is just very inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| There are small offices, large offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| The school system has grown over their 25-plus years of being over there, and they have just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| unfortunately had to create offices wherever there was space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| If you walk down some of the hallways, employee break rooms were nothing more than a little alcove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| that had a microwave, a little small bar sink, and a coffee pot if something like that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6672)|
| 1:51:23| What we saw and what the others saw, it is very non-conducive for effective operations of an office structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6683)|
| 1:51:32| The building also has HVAC issues, elevator issues, as well as total building infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| that is very antiquated at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| The proposed sale agreement that you have in front of you this evening and next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| obviously is from B&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| Phillip Welker is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| He is the principal with B&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| He will be able to answer any questions that you will have about the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| His partner is Ethan Orley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| The purchase and sale agreement does have built-in safeguards for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| We will be using a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| The developer must stay within the parameters of their proposal of what they told us they would do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| They do have a 180-day inspection period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| Once that inspection period is over, there will be another 180-day time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6742)|
| 1:52:28| for us to approve and execute the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| and this development agreement will come back to this body for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| There are reversionary rights in the agreements for the seller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| and the developer must submit requests for incentives within 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6761)|
| 1:52:48| of the effective date of the purchase and sale agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| which is what you're being asked to approve this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| So we'll have 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| We'll know what incentives, if they're seeking any of those, will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| With that being said, we have Mr. Mark Mametoff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| Chris Caldwell is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| Ben Sharble is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| We're certainly glad to have him back, as Commissioner Nystrom said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| So if there are any questions, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| I do have several commissioners that have already lit up that would like to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| First, I'll call on Commissioner Guild and Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| I think part of my questions were answered when we spoke of the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6807)|
| 1:53:35| and the process for approval and the 180-days inspection date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6815)|
| 1:53:43| but the incentive date was 120 days versus 180 days to match the two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| That's the reason I got up to pose that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| and why was there the discrepancy in those days versus them having it match with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| You hit upon the very thing that I was trying to figure out an answer to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| You've answered my incentive and contingency questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| especially under that development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| which is what was some of the safeguards I needed to ask some further clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Good clarification, Commissioner Guild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| I did get to go on the tour the other day of the A.J. Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| It was a really interesting tour to be on the rooftop there and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| but of the questions that I have been called and asked upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| that's why I'm glad to see that the principal owner of B&A is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| Because it's been three years ago where they made the bid of $6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| and because our downtown seems to be really thriving very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6892)|
| 1:55:01| and obviously the A.J. Building was not, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| a good fit for our Knox County schools in order to really collaborate well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| and be together on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| But then I had the question of it being three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| and because is B&A actually the developer because it talks about there's a developing team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6922)|
| 1:55:30| that once it's set into place that they're going to have 24 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| because it seems to be the word that $6 million was way too cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6935)|
| 1:55:43| and because it's been three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| there's been a lot that's changed in the past three years with our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| And they want to know where's the county in terms of if we sell to B&A for $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| and when they develop and they get their team together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| then what are they going to resell because it's a public knowledge that B&A is owned by the A.J. LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6962)|
| 1:56:12| which we don't know who all is involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| And that seems to be the biggest concern from people that I've heard all over the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| and other districts besides mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| and that's what I'd like to just see about after it's all said and done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| and the 24 months and the design team is all together, what really are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=6993)|
| 1:56:41| Are you all looking and I don't know, maybe you don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| but that question has to be asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| what's to keep people from buying it, doing a little bit, and turning around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| and those being the ones to really make the money off of it instead of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Yeah, I don't know if I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| I mean, I can answer it, but I think it's more pointed towards the county, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| Mark Mamentoff, Bass Creek and Sims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| The development agreement will have an anti-flipping provision in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| It will explicitly say they cannot sell the property until it's completed in accordance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| They cannot sell the property, at least all the development agreements I work on provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| and I'm sure this one will, that says you cannot resell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| until after full completion of the project, it's been placed in service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| there's a certificate of occupancy, so they cannot flip the project during the period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| We can't really prevent them from bringing investors in that we don't know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| because they're going to need investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| This project is an opportunity zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| They probably will seek some investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Mr. Welker can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| But we can add very explicit provisions that Mr. Welker will remain the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| and will be in control of the project and that they won't ever change the management control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| of the project during the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| So just like the Supreme Court site where we did a very similar development agreement for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| they require until the apartments in the Supreme Court building have been totally renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| and placed in service, they cannot flip the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| They have to retain the control with the same developer throughout the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| And if they don't move forward, they'll have certain timeframes that if they don't move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| the property will revert to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| So if they just try to sit on it, we'll get the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| Commissioner, your point to the $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| I hope you all got a chance to look at the building comparisons that we sent out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| I mean, if you look at that and look at the buildings that are sold, we're at the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| We're at the Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| We're not in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| We're not in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| We're not in Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| We're Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| So we have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| And, you know, other than just the $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| I think we really need to take a look at, you know, what is this going to do for this end of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| You know, it's going to, you know, north is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| It's thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| There's hotels and apartments and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| We need to bring that all the way down to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| And that is really going to help bridge the whole Gay Street area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| So, you know, I think the $6 million is goods, especially based on the comparisons that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7164)|
| 1:59:31| Well, and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| And I think the other big question is, too, if there's investors and all involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| and, you know, a lot of people are like, we're going to put it back on the tax row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| that's going to be several years if there's TIFs or pilots and all involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| And do we know for sure where all that is right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| At this point, we don't know what they may request, if they request anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Matt, if I might step in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| I looked at the comps on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| One that I don't think I saw on there, but I may have mentioned that it's a pretty close comp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| was the State Street office building that became the Tennessean property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| I think I saw that it was similar in that it was a government building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| It was actually owned originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| It was where the DCS office was for locally and a few other state offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| It's on Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Well, it was the one where the Tennessean Hotel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| It sold for like $500,000 in a conversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| So when I saw that kind of comp, and I don't think it was on your list, but I knew that transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| and that was a pretty close comp considering the use that we ended up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| And he may not have asked for much of a pilot or a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| but I think there may be a balance there where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| based on the price where it sells for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| that can have an influence possibly on if they choose to request any other pilot or TIF on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7257)|
| 2:01:05| So, anyhow, was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| I think we originally looked at the Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| I think we were having a hard time putting together the dots with the different entities that were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| Well, I know it was sold, and then there was a transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| but at the end of the day, the state sold it for half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| That was kind of where I saw where that one moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| And it needed a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| But moving on, that wrapped up Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| Yeah, I think it's real important for the Commission to look at the history of this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| and where it started and where it's come from, where it's at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| This Commission overwhelmingly voted to RFP or RFQ, put out the proposal of this property a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7303)|
| 2:01:52| And we voted on a contract already once with V&A as far as accepting the bid or honoring that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7312)|
| 2:02:03| This is just affirming that after we've drug our feet for two and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| through the politics of the TVA building and working out a lease and the politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| This is a formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| We need to keep our word to the people that have invested time and money and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| into doing it the right way, the clear way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| and stop this inferencing somebody else's making money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| We have a commitment to this group from months ago that said this is the building we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7347)|
| 2:02:35| And we even put parameters on what you could do with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| They stepped up to the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| They've stood with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| We've extended it for them because we have either worked out with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| or drug our feet on the politics of it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| Honor the commitment of the county on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| That should be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| We have went through this process, a long, tedious, costly process to both us and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| Honor the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| There's nothing flawed in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| You can disagree with the process, but we agreed to it a long time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| and signed a contingency deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| The county is only as good as it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| If they become hard to deal with, no developer is going to want to deal with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| and I wouldn't either if that were the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| I think Matt's done an excellent job on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| And so anything other than a yes vote is saying that the situation is flawed, and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| I think maybe Schoonmaker had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| I just have a couple of simple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| Well, Commissioner Bussler, we can have you quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| and then I'll get to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| I'm sorry I did not see his light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| We know the parameters of the contract and the sale of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| The question is now when will we see the $6 million go into the county's account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| and how long do you think will we see the full tax revenue come off of that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| I know it's not going to come off in the first 10 or 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| but maybe, what, 15 years or 20 years when you really see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| the tax revenue coming off of that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Well, I don't think we know the tax revenue until we know if there's a request for a pilot on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| With regards to the $6 million, I believe the sale agreement mentions a $10,000 deposit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| and that will be good through the inspection period and the due diligence period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| and then when we close on the deal, that would be the $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| Is it going to be two years, one year, three years, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| About a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| I would estimate about two-thirds of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| Two-thirds of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| Mr. Myers, you've done a great job on this and, of course, the original proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| and I'm glad you included the old proposal in our documents that we were able to view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| because of all the photographs and renderings and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| The only question I had was on page 11 of that old July 13, 2017, agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| originally Knox County was going to transfer ownership to AJ Partnership, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7518)|
| 2:05:25| and then it was going to go from there down to B&A Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| and looking at the current contract, it's strictly going from Knox County to B&A Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| I don't have the RFP in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| Ben Charbel, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| B&A Associates was the prime proposer on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| Typical with our contracts, whoever the prime proposer is is the contractee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| I believe that was just Phillip's org chart in the proposal that just showed what he may do later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7560)|
| 2:06:06| I mean, anyone that's familiar with developers and developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| they often create LLCs for each large development they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7570)|
| 2:06:15| So our contract and everything we have is with B&A Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| If Phillip wants to address how he plans to move forward with an AJ Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| The current contract is going from Knox County directly to B&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| In the previous one from three years ago, it said there was a middle entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| I mean, according to the flow chart that they had presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| That's the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| That's all I wanted for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Mr. Myers, can you just explain the dates, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| We've heard two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| We've heard three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| When was the RFP issued and when was it accepted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| The RFP was issued in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| I don't have the exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| April of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| This is for the sale and redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| The RFP was issued April 17, 2017, and it closed in July of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| Okay, so it's been two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| In other projects that you all, or pieces of property that you all go through the same process for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7635)|
| 2:07:24| or really any other process in procurement where you put out an RFP and you get a bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| let's say it's even a service contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| a certain amount of time goes by between when you might get the proposals, pick somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| and then actually fund it or accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| Do you sometimes that could be, is it accurate to say it could be sometimes a matter of weeks or months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7662)|
| 2:07:49| and sometimes a matter of years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Well, a lot of times, you know, the bids and things that we do, the money's already appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| It's there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| When we're selling properties, we do have dates that, you know, we'd like to close everything on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| They don't always happen that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Do you, in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| Mr. Welker was gracious, and we asked him in writing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| are you willing to stay your proposal through this process until we get here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7689)|
| 2:08:16| In that normal course of your job in procurement and sales and surplus, do you ever go back and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7696)|
| 2:08:24| once you have an agreement and a contract in place, do you ever go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| well, the market's changed, we want to change the price now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| Back to you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| This is for BNA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| Could you, I mean, this has been a long process, and we appreciate your patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| but could you just simply outline for the public your potential plans to look at what that facility will look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7723)|
| 2:08:51| Because I don't think the public now knows where you are going or what the opportunity for that to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| And we simply want to hear it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| Because most of the public doesn't have the level of information we have, and we just want it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| Yeah, to her point, we were just able to kind of take a look at your original proposal again, which is really pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| And I think what she's saying is basically, you know, kind of tell us the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| Yeah, so Phillip Welker, BNA Associates, 411 Union Street, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| Our vision is to turn it back into what it was originally, which was a grand hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| And so we've worked with McCarty-Holstaple, the architects and interior design firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| We took the original plans from 1927, which are still around, and we've used those to restructure the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| And so our intent, you know, as I've communicated to the county and stuff, I mean, this is a long, long-term thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| I mean, we've owned the Oliver Hotel here for 10 years, the other hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| We've never sold any of our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| And so I think our patience with this process has been we were never in a hurry to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| And so, you know, when you guys are ready and the school board's ready, that we would be there to do this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| whether it's next year or two years after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| But we want it to be, you know, it's the last grand historic building of its size in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| and we are proud to be a part of restoring it and bringing it back to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| And one comment, too, on the tax thing, you know, one advantage I think that we try to point out in our proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| you know, the project that we're doing versus projects that have office space or affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| is that you have hotel-motel tax, lost sales tax revenue, and job revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| So while property taxes are a component and a mechanism or a tool, I guess, to help make some of these projects financially viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7819)|
| 2:10:26| you know, our project offered something that some of the other ones can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| They don't throw up those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| Good question, Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| This question, I guess, is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Just kind of from the consensus here, there doesn't seem to be any opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| but since this is a work session meeting, are we not better to formally vote on this during a regular commission meeting then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7848)|
| 2:10:58| You usually do in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| There's no particular rule that says you can't vote on it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| and I do applaud BNA for hanging in there with the county, and there were issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| We were trying to do two or three different real estate deals at the same time to make this flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| and something that you all may not know, they also had an agreement to take care of the schools if everything else fell apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| and we still go through with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| So I just wanted to bring that to commission's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| It's also there that they've been working to help Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| To address your question, most real estate deals are closed in the actual session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7894)|
| 2:11:43| but there's no reason you couldn't vote on it tonight and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| It wouldn't be pulled off and voted on again, but it's a policy thing for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| The only law that's required is that this body vote on a real estate transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7912)|
| 2:12:00| Is there a pleasure from the body that we should move this with no recommendation for a final vote next Monday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7920)|
| 2:12:07| The original maker of the motion was from Commissioner Anders, and the second was from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| And considering this is in my district, I think we are ready to place the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| But that is what the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| I'm good with the vote, and you can choose if you want to pull it from consent next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7938)|
| 2:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| Thank you, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| Commissioner Gill, by the way, before we vote, and I'm going to look back at Mike Odom and Wink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| we're going to take a—after this vote, we're going to take a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| We've got five other items to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| Sorry, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| All in favor of this item, which is properly before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7970)|
| 2:12:51| It's on our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| And we are now going to go into a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| We've got five more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| Okay, I call us back from recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| This is item number 44, resolution requesting Knoxville and Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| to undertake a corridor study for the Western Avenue Oak Ridge Highway, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7990)|
| 2:13:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| Okay, with a motion for approval from Commissioner Gill with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| Second from Commissioner Gill with the motion from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| I wanted to add my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Me and Randy are essentially neighbors, and that's such an important study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| because of where it pulls out of Western Avenue at that 640 Plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| and connects Lonsdale and the community that I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| And we really need to take a look, especially with the development coming in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| from the historic property, it shall sway and the impact of all of that for that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8031)|
| 2:14:01| And it's a good move that we begin to look at how we can address some of those traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| and infrastructure improvements and changes over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Yes, this is a joint study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| The city is passing a resolution also to include the portion of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| The portion of the city is mainly undeveloped land or underutilized land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| We constantly sit up here on commission and talk about growth around our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8066)|
| 2:14:33| The state has provided us with some great infrastructure from 640 to Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8073)|
| 2:14:40| But this study also includes Brad's District going from Shod Road all the way to Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8080)|
| 2:14:48| which is another area that has a vast amount of land that has been undeveloped along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| And I think if we look at this holistically from 640, where it's infrastructures there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| and lack of developments there, along with the potential for infrastructure and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| all the way to Shod Road, it is best to look at this as a holistic approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| And I don't have a slide show or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| This is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Bob, where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| Yes, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| I guess that was a comment towards me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| So how much is it going to cost us, Mr. Smith, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| About the same as yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| It's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| It's an in-house study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| There'll be no fiscal note on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8137)|

| 2:15:51| So that's rock solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| All in favor of this motion, which is probably before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8158)|

| 2:16:05| Item number 45 is a resolution approving an appropriation in the amount of $200,000 from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| the general fund balance to the Knoxville Chamber in support of their new strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| vision, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Beeler, I believe I heard, and was there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Was that Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| We'll get the second on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| The chair recognizes Mr. Mike Odom from the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| You know, I'd like to give you an opportunity to kind of give us a brief update here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| So the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| I actually had to look at my business card before I walked up here to make sure of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| I have about 38 slides, if you guys don't mind me going through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| So we have been working for a number of months now on really evaluating where the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8218)|
| 2:17:05| needs to go and what role it plays within the community, what the stakeholders here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| want to see in our community going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| So in December, our board adopted a new strategic vision for the organization, and we will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8233)|
| 2:17:20| go about it publicly until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| We have been meeting with stakeholders in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| We'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| We have met with almost all of the County Commission here to go over that, and the feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| has been very insightful, very supportive of where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| I don't want to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| But we need help to get that started, and you all have been very supportive of us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| the past, and so we're here asking again to let us move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| We are starting our strategies, working on really focused on local businesses, helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| them grow, working on workforce development strategies and talent retention and attraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| strategies and access to capital strategies and all the things that we've been hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| I've been here about just over eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| In that time, I have met with about 250 stakeholders across the region, and they've told us we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8284)|
| 2:18:12| need you all to be more innovative, strategic, aggressive, and that's where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| So I really want to thank the Chairman and Mayor Jacobs for putting this item on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| It would mean a lot to us for the Commission to be able to do this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| What I might add is, while I brought it to us in conjunction with the Mayor, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| to invite all of my fellow Commissioners to come sign on as joint sponsors, if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| But moving on, we do have Commissioner Daley, then Carringer, then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| Mr. Odom or Mr. Caldwell, this was already in the budget, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8320)|
| 2:18:49| Actually, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| Previous years, the Commission has been very kind to fund our Innovation Valley Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8332)|
| 2:18:58| at $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| For this budget cycle, that was actually reduced to $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Well, that makes sense here because this is $200,000 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| I think I saw your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| Well, either way, it makes no difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| And here's my observation because I would like to see some better benchmarks and timeframes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| as we approve this amount of money, which is what I spoke to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Because the lack of diversity and resources allocated as we move to our benchmarks need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8371)|
| 2:19:37| to have a better system of checks and balances as we spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8382)|
| 2:19:43| And, Commissioner, one of the things that you and I spoke about actually with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| Commission was that we need to be more transparent in what we're doing and how we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| We need to be – we have to have better metrics, better accountability, and we have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| started to implement that, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| So I appreciate that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8399)|
| 2:20:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| Now, Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8401)|
| 2:20:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| And when we say you hit the ground running, you really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| You've only been here eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| And so I really want to applaud the leadership that you have gathered from your team and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8410)|
| 2:20:19| that you realize that we may need some changes, how important it is to Knox County because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8419)|
| 2:20:27| all of us sitting up here think it's the best place to live, work, and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| And by engaging and reaching out to everyone in the community, your small businesses, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8431)|
| 2:20:39| large businesses, the elected officials, and the people that are out there working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8439)|
| 2:20:46| and raising their kids that don't have as much time to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| So I'm looking forward to what the Chamber and being able to see some things that haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8450)|
| 2:20:57| worked and being willing to say, well, maybe we've not done that great to say we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8457)|
| 2:21:05| to change, and change is always hard, especially in our southern areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| So I really appreciate the work that you've been doing and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| I know it hasn't been easy, but the whole thing of making it more transparent and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| out there to welcome that your office is welcoming people really means a lot, and we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8480)|
| 2:21:27| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| That's very kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| It really has been a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| Our team has worked extremely hard to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8494)|
| 2:21:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| And I just also wanted to recognize Amy Nolan for sitting in the back there and hanging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| in there to the bitter end, and we appreciate her liaison between Commission and the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8500)|
| 2:21:46| Well, I appreciate saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8506)|
| 2:21:47| Actually, and we've talked about this to those who we've had a chance to meet with, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| created a new department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| So we've really reorganized the structure of our organization around this new strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| vision, and she is leading that work where previously she was a team of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8516)|
| 2:22:00| We're actually giving her, and this is part of where this funding will go to help build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| a team, to help create more programmatic offerings that we can really deliver meaningful, measurable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| So I appreciate you saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| This motion is probably for us, but before we vote on it, as I said earlier, would everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| on the Commission like to sign on as a co-sponsor of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8540)|

| 2:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8542)|

| 2:22:44| She doesn't need to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8564)|

| 2:22:47| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8567)|

| 2:22:56| Was that item 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| I say because there's going to be no recommendation if she just needed to give the 0-20-1-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8577)|

| 2:23:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8629)|

| 2:24:11| Item number 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| Item 48 needs to be sent forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8653)|

| 2:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| With the motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker, second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8673)|
| 2:24:40| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8681)|

| 2:24:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Item number 56 is a discussion item regarding the process of the Knox County having their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8684)|
| 2:25:00| own planning office slash board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| As I discussed in the forum, do we want to move that to next week or would you like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| handle that tonight, Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| Either way, I just think it's time that we have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| There's a caption bill that the state legislative delegation has in its caption bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8711)|
| 2:25:18| With how the growth policy plan went, I think it's time that Town of Fairgate voted it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8718)|
| 2:25:25| and wanted to influence, their request was to influence everything from Blount County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8725)|
| 2:25:32| to Anderson County line west of the Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| I think we just, to keep other governments from influencing our government and our planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| I think it's important that we probably look at either having our own board or having our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| own planning office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| I think that's something we should take into consideration because we're virtually being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| forced by an old statute that the law director and I think has expired based on the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8756)|
| 2:26:06| vote and not gathering together, but I think we're compressed and I think it's bad planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8766)|
| 2:26:14| to allow that to occur to Knox County for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| I think we need the development plan where we could have had some good cluster development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8778)|
| 2:26:26| Those are some great ideas and they come out of Gerald's office, but I think we need a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| board that has the county in mind and I think we should always think regionally, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8790)|
| 2:26:38| sometimes we've got to think for ourselves and we've got to plan for ourselves and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| think it's time that we look at doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8807)|

| 2:26:57| I appreciate the conversation that we're going to have around the potential for this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| I know the legislative body is keeping an eye on this caption bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| Is that a correct assessment, John, or as it moves through this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| That's what I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| But I represent a district mostly in the city and I think as we move through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8834)|
| 2:27:21| the voice of that is going to be really important not to be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8841)|
| 2:27:28| And I know the city's process can sometimes not take the county in conversation in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8848)|
| 2:27:41| of the county's language into their process and make decisions that impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| But I certainly do not want the information and the voice of the urban district to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8866)|
| 2:27:54| left out as we move through this process because it is going to be equally as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8874)|
| 2:28:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| I along with Commissioner Anders see that there's a time that we need to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8887)|
| 2:28:11| take control of our destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200218b?start=8891)|
