| 2:33:04| I think that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| We're not flush with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| We're building roads that we planned on in the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| So we've got to be a county that's either forward thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| or continue kicking the can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| And I think it's a wonderful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| But it's not something that we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| I mean, there's a road at Carnes Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| The road has been on the top ten list at Carnes Middle School for the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| I think we're in the top three or four now, maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| But it's a $7 million road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| I mean, it's just, we don't have the vision in our road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| to move forward with a robust build like this project suggests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9222)|
| 2:33:47| I think it's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9227)|
| 2:33:48| But it's just, you've got to make a decision if you're going to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| or keep kicking the can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| And that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| Again, Commissioner, I really appreciate you doing this and looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9241)|
| 2:34:09| I'm brought back to where we were a few minutes ago in our growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| And come Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Oh, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| And Hardin Valley, an area that we're putting a lot of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| and we're really banking on that community to grow our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| And I look out there, and they do have one of the largest parks in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| You can't get to it because of the roads, and there's nothing to do once you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| They don't have a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| So it seems that we're asking those people to do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| And I just kind of feel like if we're going to do a park or a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| that's the place we need to look at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| Well, look, I'll leave it in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| Ultimately, I think as a body, if we're going to go down that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| and have that discussion that every single time we spend a dollar in anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| we're going to say, is this the number one top priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| And we're never going to do anything except for the top priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| and then we're going to move to number two, and then we're going to move to number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| If we want to do that and focus on that in that order and chip away at it, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9305)|
| 2:35:09| Let's let that be the will of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| and I think we can do something across the county where we find critical risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| critical needs, and an opportunity to enhance life in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| So I think I've said my piece, and we've put that to bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9322)|
| 2:35:26| but I'll be happy to answer any other questions after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| I think you did an excellent job, but this goes to every member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9334)|
| 2:35:38| I think there are lots of priorities in individual districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| and I would love to see a priority list and a secondary list because as a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9342)|
| 2:35:47| we do not have a complete picture of where we need to be in five years or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9347)|
| 2:35:56| We have 11 people sitting around this in this forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9356)|
| 2:36:02| but we have individual needs in every district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| and I would really like to see a conversation that is sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| so that we can identify what those priorities are for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| We have no idea what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| You have one in your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| I have several in mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| but we do not even have a conversation to say what the vision for the county is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9381)|
| 2:36:27| based on the 11 people sitting around this tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| I'm not opposed to funding the design phase of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| That gives you something to go to Legacy Parks with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| or maybe something to go to TDOT with and work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| I'll just put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| Not the acquisition part, but just the design part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| Frankly, that was kind of what I was getting at when I asked the question earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| to see if it's possible to split those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| Okay, I think that concludes the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| That was Item 42, which we had put in front of Item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9424)|
| 2:37:09| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| The motion before us is to send the line items forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9446)|
| 2:37:27| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| Is there anyone here who would like to address County Commission on public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9451)|
| 2:37:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| We do have to set a date, I think, for a hearing, and then we'll do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| commissioners, please take a look at your calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| We'll have room for announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| Oh, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| Thank you for the reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker, going back to our finance meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9474)|
| 2:37:58| we'd be grateful if you'd share with this body the final part of that finance committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| around Tennessee revenues at the county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| Okay, right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| If you're good, I think we're good to have that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| If everyone would like to pull out the three pages that Drew put on your desks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9489)|
| 2:38:14| during the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| And while you're doing that, I have an additional page I just wanted to reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| that I found interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| This was just for the month of December for the Tennessee Department of Revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9503)|
| 2:38:30| and it was the sales and use tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| It's interesting, in FY 2017 and 2018, they were up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9514)|
| 2:38:41| now this is just for the month of December, $58 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| But this past December, which we think of for sales and use tax with all the holiday shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9526)|
| 2:38:52| and everything, that that would have actually increased even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| This year it actually decreased by $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| So in FY 17-18, the revenue for the month was up 8.75%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9540)|
| 2:39:08| but this past year it was only 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| So I'm wondering if now we're going to see a trend for the consumer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9552)|
| 2:39:20| slowing down their purchasing in the next six months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| So I thought that was kind of an interesting figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9564)|
| 2:39:27| Do you think any of that has contributed to Internet sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9567)|
| 2:39:31| Some, yes, and we'll get to that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| But the first page that you got, this is kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| This is just six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| It's from July 1st through December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| And if you look at the highlighted area, you can see that for FY 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9583)|
| 2:39:50| the state of Tennessee is doing pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| They collected $7 billion in total revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| And then also you can see that, follow that over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| that's almost a 4% increase over the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| And then the local government, which is all 95 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| you can see that that number is increased by 7.15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9609)|
| 2:40:15| So our colleagues around the state are doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| The second page, this is just kind of interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| because this is the 7% only tax that's collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| by the different counties in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| And the top five counties are highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| So you can see what kind of numbers some of our colleagues are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| And you'll see that Rutherford County is slowly moving up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| They're now the number five county, soon to be number four in population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9640)|
| 2:40:46| But one of the interesting figures at the bottom of the page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| of the right column, which is out-of-state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| or what could be classified as the Internet sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| of almost $850 million collected in the first six months of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9657)|
| 2:41:03| And, of course, if you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| five years, eight years ago, Tennessee didn't have this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| So this is terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| The interesting thing will be to follow how some of this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| on the next page will come down to actually the different entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9676)|
| 2:41:23| whether it's a town or a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| So this last page was actually just the 2.25% for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| what it was collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| But you can see that we've collected almost $100 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| just in the first six months of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| And, again, you can see the out-of-state of $141 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9699)|
| 2:41:47| just that's credited to the 2.25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| or if it's 2.75% for, say, Sevier County, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| But I just thought this is kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| You can see how some of our neighbors that don't have a dramatic population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9717)|
| 2:42:04| how they're surviving on not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| So we're thankful that, in a lot of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| people are coming to Knox County to do their purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9733)|
| 2:42:16| so some of the other counties are helping us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| I just think it's interesting that we're very fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| that Tennessee is doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| One quick bit of housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| I've got a note from Drusilla as a reminder that we need to set up a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| for a public hearing for the Zoning Ordinance No. 39,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| which we did the first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| And I'll ask the Law Department to verify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| but I guess we'll have the second reading at the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| And then can we set a date for that ordinance on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| probably to have the public hearing maybe in February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| We've got to go next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| Yeah, I'm talking about for the February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| Yeah, so work session on the 18th would be a good after the work session on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| Yeah, the second reading will be Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9784)|
| 2:43:05| And then we need to have a public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| The second reading will be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| It'll be the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| It'll be the first reading next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| That's right, yeah, because this is a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| So the second reading will be in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| So if it pleases this body, at next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| we will officially select the day for the public hearing, which will be in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9801)|
| 2:43:25| Which could be the Tuesday for the work session in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| So I'm just giving you a preview of something that we'll probably just add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| I'll add it to the agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| No one here for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Jesse Mayshark was here to talk to us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| I think you're the last survivor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| Any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| If you've got an announcement to make, go ahead and just turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| I just wanted to remind everybody that Doc Rock is this Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| and you can go to Metro Drug Coalition or to Knoxville Academy Medicine Alliance to get all the details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9838)|
| 2:44:08| Each band that plays is representing a non-profit dealing with health and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9848)|
| 2:44:17| So I just wanted to remind everybody of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| I was hoping Mr. Snowden was still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| I just wanted to mention that his team did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9865)|
| 2:44:28| Something happened up in the 6th Commission District today on Campbell Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9868)|
| 2:44:32| where a large tree fell and blocked part of Campbell Station Road and hit power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9872)|
| 2:44:37| And they responded quickly and got that situation so the traffic could continue towards Hardin Valley on Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9877)|
| 2:44:46| So I appreciate that quick action from Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| Seeing no other lights on for announcements, I'd like to have a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| A lot of moves, a lot of seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| This meeting is officially adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| All in favor of adjournment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9903)|

| 2:45:05| All opposed say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9905)|
| 2:45:06| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| We're dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9908)|
