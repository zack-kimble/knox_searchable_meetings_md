| 0:00:00| Rather than draw names, I'd like to do this in alphabetical order if that's all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=6)|
| 0:00:07| I'd like to ask all of the persons that are going to be speaking to us to give us three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=7)|
| 0:00:11| minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=11)|
| 0:00:12| We have your resumes and so we have the detailed information about you and what I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| do is to have you keep your remarks to about three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=16)|
| 0:00:19| Then if we have any questions, we'll be happy to do that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=19)|
| 0:00:25| The order we will go in, as I understand, is Dr. Leonard Brown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=25)|
| 0:00:28| He had said he would not be able to be here today, so I'm assuming that he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| We'll start out with Richard Evans, then we'll go to Levi Fry, then Ron Heese, Steve Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| George Hillegas, Jackson Wade Jenkins, George Montgomery, and then Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| That'll be the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| If you would help us by being ready to go, because I know it's the lunch hour and everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=44)|
| 0:00:48| is anxious to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| Let's start with Mr. Richard Evans, if you'll come to the podium please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| If you would give us, again, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| My name is Richard Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| I live at 4400 Wall Rock Lane, Knoxville, northwest part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| I'd like to thank the commission for allowing me this opportunity today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| You do have my resume in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| Most of my professional career has been in newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| I've worked around government and with government officials for close to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| I do have a degree in political science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| And I am the ultimate political outsider, because I am a complete unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| I've never held an elected office before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| But my view of this position is that it is a caretaker position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| The person who has this position will only serve for less than two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| And unless the legislature is called into session, there's really not going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| great deal for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| My political views, and again, unless the legislature is called into session, my political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| views really don't amount to a hill of beans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| But I have no connections to any party, any political group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| I am a conservative individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| I have a Christian biblical worldview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| Simply put, and Mayor Burchett mentioned this morning and has mentioned here again earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=137)|
| 0:02:26| I would not do anything that would embarrass this district or this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| And I do know the difference between right and wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| I do have a heart to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| And I think this is one way that we could provide the people with a true citizen legislator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| Again, unless we're called into session, there's not going to be a great deal for this person to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| to hold this job until the people elect the person they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| And I'd appreciate any consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Any questions, Commissioners, for Mr. Richard Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| I just have one, and I won't ask the question of each person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| But for all these people, have we confirmed that you actually live in the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Our next, Levi Fry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Mr. Fry here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Mr. Ron Heese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| My name is Ron Heese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I grew up in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| I've lived in Knoxville since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| As you'll notice on my resume, graduated undergrad from Maryville College with a degree in international business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| and got my master's MBA from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| I, too, see the position as a caretaker position, more as a volunteer position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| It's something that may not be called to do anything, but it's worth representing, worth stepping in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| I see this as a volunteer opportunity, just like any other charitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| or volunteer position I would have taken on my own accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Saw the opportunity and wanted to step into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Kind of had that desire to take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| My professional career, I've been employed since 2000 with Jeldwyn Doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| located in the Fort Slip River Park here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| Done that since 2001, since my undergraduate graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| And most recently, a year ago, I started a bookkeeping and tax practice here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| Got a small family, two small children, but like I said, I volunteer, help them with sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| and the things they're involved with, and thought I could step in and try to help with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| just for the short amount of time that it would do to be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Any questions for Mr. Heese?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Thank you, sir, for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Steve Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the commission, thank you for inviting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| Let me congratulate each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| I truly understand the commitment that you've made to run for this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| as we all stood out there in the hot heat and sweated this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| So congratulations, and I look forward to working with you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=310)|
| 0:05:19| I have spent the last 17 years as an employee of St. Mary's Health System, and I want to concentrate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| In the last 10 years of those 17 years, I was in government relations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| which required me to spend most of my time in Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| I've probably sat through more meetings than any other person than the legislators, the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| God forbid that something would happen, but if it does happen, I have the experience to go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| and fill in for Senator Burchett, who has done an outstanding job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| I do understand this is a caretaker position, and I appreciate that, but we always have to be prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=354)|
| 0:06:02| and I think I bring that experience to the table just in case we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| In addition to my work experience, I have served 12 years on the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| of which I was chairman or vice chairman eight of those 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| So I think I have some additional experience in the fact that I have worked with the local county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| and understand the educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| I would certainly appreciate your vote and support for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| and I thank you for allowing me to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| Questions for Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| And I do live in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Rick Hillegas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| I hope I pronounced that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Mr. Hillegas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Jackson Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| Before I make my statement, just let me say from earlier, the idea to take the meetings out into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| I think that's outstanding, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| My name is Jackson Wade Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I'm an attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| My main practice is veterans' law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| I assist veterans, so I have community service there in my background with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| And I also do some civil litigation, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| That pays the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| That allows me to do the veterans' practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| The gentlemen before me have all mentioned the word caretaker, and they're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| This is a caretaker position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| I've been down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| I've worked in a House office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| I've worked in a Senate office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| I will know right off the bat how to be that caretaker if someone is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| I don't foresee any special session call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| There hasn't been any whispers of anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| But what I see a need for possibly is constituent services, and that's what I did while I was down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| If someone had a problem, they called the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| I was the one who took care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| If there was 10 care issues, licensing issues, things like that, that's what you need your Senate for during the office session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| And I know how to do that, and I appreciate y'all if y'all would give me the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Questions for Mr. Jenkins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Thank you, sir, for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| George Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=488)|
| 0:08:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| It is a privilege to be here this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| It's, if I may, a special privilege to me because my father was on the predecessor county court to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=513)|
| 0:08:46| I'm correct in that remembrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| My experience in government began in Washington with Howard Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| I was his foreign policy advisor, became counsel to the majority leader when he became the majority leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| and was responsible for liaising between the Senate and the different agencies of the government that deal in national security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=550)|
| 0:09:20| and foreign policy and international affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| During that period, I learned, got interested in the Middle East, learned a good deal about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| traveled there, got to know the governments, and made it a special interest of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=570)|
| 0:09:41| and I think I've developed a pretty good expertise in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| I've learned a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| It remains a part of what I do in the Baker Donaldson Law Firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=587)|
| 0:09:55| More importantly, I learned you can't be around Howard Baker for ten years without learning the values of common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=595)|
| 0:10:05| of civility, of learning to assimilate different points of view and different perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=605)|
| 0:10:14| and respecting different points of view and different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| I can't claim to have mastered those values nearly to the extent that he has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=620)|
| 0:10:29| but I believe they made him the great leader that he was, is, and it's something I try to adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=629)|
| 0:10:45| It was those values that framed my approach to running an embassy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=645)|
| 0:10:54| and managing the relationship between the United States and the Sultanate of Oman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Oman is a friendly country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| They've got a fairly strong western orientation, but they have different interests, different priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| We didn't always agree, and we needed to work things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| The values that I learned from Senator Baker served me well in that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=674)|
| 0:11:24| When I returned to Knoxville, I had the opportunity to serve on the Board of Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=684)|
| 0:11:32| and I saw firsthand there the fact, the value of those, the benefit of those values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=692)|
| 0:11:43| in working out the balance between preservation and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| There are values that I would bring to this opportunity if I had the privilege to succeed Senator Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=712)|
| 0:12:07| and it would be a privilege, and I ask for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| And I'm a resident of Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Our final speaker is Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=742)|
| 0:12:33| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Chuck Williams, 922 Oglewood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| That is in District 7, County District 2, City District 6, School Board 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| I don't remember the number for assembly, but I know Billy Dunn is my assemblyman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| First off, I want to congratulate all you newly elected and reelected commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| I'm privileged to be here, and regardless of what happens now or in November, which I will win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| I will be working with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| I know this is a caretaker's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| I'm not trying to gain an edge over my two opponents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| I'm not really scared of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| One never shows up for debates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| The other one got so scared when I told him I was a kicker's buddy wore a mask in Neyland Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| so I'm not worried about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I'm more concerned about the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| I know the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| I know the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| And even though there's no emergency sessions planned or anything like this, people have called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| I have called some of you commissioners throughout the years, helping people with different problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| I still have people calling me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| I practically live in a penal farm helping people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| I ask JJ for an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| I've called various agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Right now I'm working on different things on different levels, state, school board, city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| that people come to me all across the district of all races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| So basically I'm more concerned about what the electorate need and not party politics or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=836)|
| 0:14:05| That's why I'm independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| This is nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| It's not going to swing nothing in nobody's favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| I'm just mainly worried about the people of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| And that's why I feel I'm the best candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| And out of all of us that have spoke, there's only two of us that thought enough of it to seek the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| Myself and Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| He was really the only one I was scared of if he won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| So basically I think I am the best person for this because I realize what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| I know the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| And all of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Even those that are newly elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| And being an incumbent, this commission or the previous commission has a history of placing those that were seeking office in the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=881)|
| 0:14:51| while they sought the office for the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| And being an incumbent, no disrespect to anybody, but being an incumbent didn't help people that lost their jobs yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| because they're no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| So I don't think it's an edge either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| I think it's what's best for the people and I think I'm the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Questions for Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| You're voting on September 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| I will be down the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| That's the day that the person that murdered my son starts trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| But it's a phone call away or you send somebody down there if I win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| But I'll be in court for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| That's all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100901statesenatedistrict7?start=938)|
