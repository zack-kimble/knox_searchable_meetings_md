| 2:20:41| Item 7-H-19-RZ is a request of Richard and Judy Harris for rezoning from PR Plan Residential to A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8441)|
| 2:20:49| located at 1227 Tipton Station Road, parcel ID 13703101 and 03102 in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8449)|
| 2:21:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8461)|

| 2:21:05| By a vote of 10-0 on the Consent Agenda, the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission recommended approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| of the zoning designation of agricultural for this 4.74-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8471)|
| 2:21:19| It's located within a South City Sector Plan designation of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| Also, the adjacent subdivision did not include this acreage in their density calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| So, the designation of this property as agricultural will not affect the compliance of that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| with its density requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8495)|

| 2:25:57| And once again, I want to emphasize, to restate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| and looking at the owner, sir, this is for three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8763)|

| 2:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| 7-N-19-RZ is a request of Wes Owen for rezoning from A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8776)|

| 2:26:22| Property is located at 3900 Fountain Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| Parcel ID 3815903 and 16002, which is part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| and it's in the 7th Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8796)|
| 2:26:37| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| The Planning Commission, by vote of 10-0 on the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| recommended that the County Commission approve the industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| for this 16.2-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| The industrial zoning is an extension of the existing surrounding zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| and complies with the North County Sector Plan land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| of light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| The area is also within the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8827)|
| 2:27:08| Wes Owen, 3908 Fountain Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Seeing none, the Chair will look to Commissioner Bessler for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8841)|
| 2:27:22| Wes, I want to ask you a question out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| What are you going to do with the old Stockyard Cafe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| I'm not sure at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| We're doing RV storage right now on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| I make a motion that we approve for staff recommendation to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| zoning from agricultural to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| And also, we just paved that road out through there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| It needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| The motion is by Commissioner Bessler with the second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8870)|
| 2:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8874)|
| 2:27:55| The motion is by Commissioner Bessler with the second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| So, is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8891)|
| 2:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| The next item is Ordinance O-19-8-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| This amending the Knox County Code Appendix A zoning, Article VI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| by adding a new Section 6.80 to create a plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8910)|
| 2:28:38| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8920)|
| 2:28:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8923)|
| 2:28:44| The Planning Commission recommended by a vote of 14-0 that the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8924)|
| 2:28:49| Commission approve the amendment to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| establishing a plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| An approval process is designed to encourage creativity in site design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| and flexibility in the approval of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| It would allow a project plan to be reviewed, approved, and implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| without a change in the zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| It does provide the Planning Commission with the ability to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8951)|
| 2:29:16| and the County Commission with the ability to authorize waivers to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| underlying dimensional and use standards of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| In order to do that, the Planning Commission would have to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| and the County Commission would have to agree that the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| provides certain exceptional aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| These could include, but are not unlimited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| that they enhance the overall merit of the plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| that promote the objectives of both Knox County and the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| enhance the quality of the design of the structures in the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| will not cause excessive adverse impact on neighboring properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| would further the goals of the adopted Knoxville-Knox County General Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| and would provide a public benefit to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8996)|
| 2:29:59| This process involves public review before the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| and the County Commission with a recommendation on the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| by the Planning Commission and approval of the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9008)|
| 2:30:11| by the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| It does provide an opportunity for a conceptual plan to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| That conceptual plan submittal and review is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| It's up to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| but the preliminary plan would be subject to review by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| and the County Commission at public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| which is advertised according to the Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| administrative rules and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| I also want to remind my fellow commissioners that this will be a roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| as it is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| But regarding discussion, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9048)|
| 2:30:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| Director Green, if you could walk us through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| Let's say I have 12 acres and I have a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| I come to you and where does it go from there and what's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| The first step, there's a mandatory meeting with staff to review in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| the proposed development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| So you would come in and it could be just a sketch on a piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| just your idea, and you present that concept to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| The staff would provide input as to, in their opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| and this is not mandatory, information that should be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| If a traffic impact analysis is required because the anticipated traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| would meet the threshold for requiring a traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| to ensure that infrastructure is available, that you provide proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| that infrastructure is available for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| Maybe question you on the details of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| and provide you with information on submittal dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| and when that project would be reviewed by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| From that point, you would have the option of presenting a conceptual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| which is a less detailed plan if you decide to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| It would be scheduled for review by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| The advertisement would be sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| There would be a notice in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| would be placed on the Planning Commission's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| notice on the website, postcards to surrounding property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| and a sign on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| The conceptual plan would be reviewed by the Planning Commission with no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| It would be basically an information gathering session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| where you as the applicant would provide information to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| The Planning Commission could provide information back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| or ask questions to gain more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9160)|
| 2:32:43| Following the conceptual plan, which again is optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| you would provide a preliminary plan that would be subject to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| by planning staff, engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| possibly utilities to ensure that utilities could be provided to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9173)|
| 2:32:59| The Planning Commission would review that at a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| which again would be advertised and noticed in accordance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| the Planning Commission's administrative procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| The Planning Commission would make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| That recommendation would be forwarded to the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| The County Commission would review the plan at a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9194)|
| 2:33:18| make a determination of approval, approval with conditions, or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9198)|
| 2:33:24| If the project is approved, you would then prepare a final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| that would incorporate recommendations from the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| submit that to staff for review and final approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| and then you could obtain your permits following the approval of that final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9214)|
| 2:33:45| Have you identified pieces of property this might apply to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| Any within the planned growth area of the county, so no particular properties, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9230)|
| 2:33:56| There was a person who wanted to do a tiny home development in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9236)|
| 2:34:04| and I can't remember the exact site, but that would be a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| that could come under this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| Okay, and when you say waivers, such as it takes, am I reading this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9250)|
| 2:34:17| it takes zoning out of the equation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| It takes zoning out of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9259)|
| 2:34:20| So you could have a piece of agricultural land that could be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| as a residential piece of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| Okay, and when you say a public meeting by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9266)|
| 2:34:29| is that like the zoning meeting, or do we have to have a special meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9269)|
| 2:34:33| It would be the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9275)|
| 2:34:39| All right, thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| Mr. Green, we had some really bad rains and things this past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| and this planned zoning, are you going to take into this kind of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| when you're doing these plan reviews where we have natural places where we have sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9293)|
| 2:35:00| that take care of the water and drain it off the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| We're having problems where a developer comes in and just flattens the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9303)|
| 2:35:08| and creates a hill on one side, we have a hill that slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| and we have runoff in our next neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| And I know that you said something about protecting the surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| and if it does have this topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| and they want to change the topography of that land that causes water problems on neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9322)|
| 2:35:29| is that going to be taken care of in these kinds of zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| because you said a more in-depth plan to protect the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| That's one of the items that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| In fact, one of the criteria of community benefits going on down the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| is preservation of existing environmental features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| including protection for steep slopes of 15% or more slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| So what we're trying to encourage is that creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| where natural features of the site are preserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| and we can increase density or work with the developer and his or her design team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9356)|
| 2:36:04| to put the density and the development on the more appropriate locations within the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9364)|
| 2:36:10| and transfer that density from the steeper slopes to those less severe slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| and less topographically and environmentally challenged portions of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| So you are going to be notating on the property or the plans that come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| areas that do have the sinkholes that take care of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9385)|
| 2:36:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| All right, thank you, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| Mr. Green, you have a process site map for zoning and user-owned review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9397)|
| 2:36:43| a document you've provided, I'm sure, all of us several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| that's going to show steps one through if this decision is made, go left, go right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| You know what I'm talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9412)|
| 2:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| Do you have such a similar document for this type of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| Not yet, but before the second reading, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| I think that would be incredibly helpful to determine the decision tree of what the process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| and why and what the appeal process may be or what the public process might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| and I think understanding that in a more simple visual way might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| We'll have that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9437)|
| 2:37:18| Do you have a real-world example of something that would fall under this type of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9438)|
| 2:37:24| You'd cite, you know, in Austin there was XYZ, this would be similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9444)|
| 2:37:30| And I'll state a couple in Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| Had this similar process years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| Biltmore Park, south of Asheville on the way to the airport, just past the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9458)|
| 2:37:45| is an example of a huge plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| There's a smaller one in west Asheville, State Street at Hudson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9469)|
| 2:37:54| which is where a courtyard cottage development, eight units on a bit over half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9474)|
| 2:38:01| And they were single-family homes that were developed on a half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| So those are a bit over half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| Those are two examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| Thinking of others, I had one on the tip of my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| There's actually one similar to this at Westland and I think Ebenezer that Oliver Smith did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9498)|
| 2:38:27| He did it in different parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| There's a church, a soccer field, some apartments, single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9509)|
| 2:38:36| And then there's a Y goes there, too, that he had to get each property individually zoned and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9516)|
| 2:38:43| So under this process, you could do it all with one plan approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9523)|
| 2:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| And then in the conceptual review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| help me understand the conceptual review process and why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| There's so many other things that are sort of mandatory, but that is optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| And I'm a little confused as to why that is an optional part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| There's been a lot of discussion about that and it's gone back and forth as to whether to make it mandatory or optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9546)|
| 2:39:12| We're trying, and one of the reasons to make it optional, an argument to keep it optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| is this is a new process and a bit uncertain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| and we don't want to put an applicant through too many steps to scare them away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| We'd like to see this used to address some of the issues that Commissioner Busler talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| the environment, preserving important environmental features to provide opportunity for a range of uses on the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9572)|
| 2:39:41| It's going to be, I think, somewhat challenging as it is adding another step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| As a mandatory conceptual plan review, we felt it may tip the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| so that it would be less attractive to applicants to use this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9590)|
| 2:39:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| I noticed the governmental affairs director for the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors is in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9599)|
| 2:40:05| I didn't know if she wanted to address us or provide a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9605)|
| 2:40:14| I'll always take an invitation to speak to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| Jennifer Roach, Knoxville Area Association of Realtors, 609 West Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| I know I spoke to most of you over the phone today, and I apologize for those I didn't get to about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9622)|
| 2:40:28| Sorry I've been gone for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| I'm going to blame that on recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| You know, when I talked about this with some of my governmental affairs committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9634)|
| 2:40:40| with some different realtors who specialize in different fields, residential and commercial and everything in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9640)|
| 2:40:47| we looked through this, and this is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| This is not a planned development zone like the city used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| This process is really a neat tool in the zoning toolbox that Knox County has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9653)|
| 2:40:58| So your zoning code is your opportunity code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| What can you put on the ground there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| And like Director Green said, really neat developments that you see in counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| and cities of similar geography, similar size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| Some really neat developments in Udawah, Tennessee that you'll see with some kind of smaller town centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| where it's sort of a master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| Different areas of town can have kind of town center areas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| So it's a wonderful opportunity for a lot of community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9686)|
| 2:41:31| and we sort of wish you could do this on almost every property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9691)|
| 2:41:34| You've got a lot of safeguards for green spaces, environmental use, efficient use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9694)|
| 2:41:42| You know, you're asking for what could we use this for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| Well, zoning follows innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| Zoning doesn't create innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9707)|
| 2:41:49| So I'm excited to see what may come out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9709)|
| 2:41:52| You know, there's a lot of safeguards about adverse impact to other neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| and things that are really important right now like housing affordability and senior housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9716)|
| 2:42:01| and the safeguard in there or the kind of definition of affordable housing is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9721)|
| 2:42:08| So we support this and look at it as a good tool moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| knowing that there will probably be, you know, some revisions to it as the process goes along and it gets refined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| And, you know, it's not a free-for-all for anybody, for the community to ask for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| for the developer to ask for everything, for the city to ask for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| But I think it's a tool that creates a lot of collaboration to find some innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| and forward-looking, efficient, and creative uses of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| So we fully support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9756)|
| 2:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| Director Green, I've got four questions, yes or no answers, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| This will probably have more upfront costs for developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| as they have to probably develop more engineering earlier in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9779)|
| 2:43:00| This will provide for a quicker process from start to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9780)|
| 2:43:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| It will provide for more flexibility and a broader range of land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| And there will be more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| I've got a question, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| I know some of the intent on this, we're often talking, I'm thinking about the PR zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| and so often if we want to protect a hillside, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| we often do during the use on review plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| encourage development in flatter areas on larger parcels to preserve the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| and get the density concentrated in areas to preserve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| which is something we've already been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| I guess what so that's part of the intent of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| But I guess what rang a bell for me was I do remember how hard we worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| to figure out a solution with that property that Oliver Smith had here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| I can't remember if it was last year or the year before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| and I do recall we had a lot of debate, we had a lot of folks from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9838)|
| 2:44:01| and I think we ended up at something that seemed to make everybody happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| once everything was said and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| So I guess back to Mr. Smith's question, I mean, you know, I've drilled on this twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| and, you know, I've read some of the comments on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| but it does appear once again that we are going to have more ways for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| to be fully communicated to so the residents can vote their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| and definitely be at the table on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| Is that kind of right too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| And we want that process to be a conversation as opposed to a debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9869)|
| 2:44:35| and too often now when we have developments come in, it's a debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| and we start a process where there's a conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| the entire community wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9885)|
| 2:44:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9887)|
| 2:44:48| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| We do need to get a motion on the floor, and then we would have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| So if there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9897)|

| 2:45:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9901)|
| 2:45:02| Madam Clerk, this does need to be a roll call vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| so if you could please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9904)|

| 2:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9939)|
| 2:45:40| That's the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| The call to vote, it's 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| And that concludes all business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9944)|
| 2:45:45| We need to set a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9946)|

| 2:45:52| We need to schedule a public hearing on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| That will need to take place next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| My suggestion is to do it maybe in conjunction with our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| So I would like to find out if this body would like to do the public hearing either before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190826?start=9955)|
