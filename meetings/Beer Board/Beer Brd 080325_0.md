| 0:10:01| Ms. Pelo, you could probably hit a horseshoe at the new Nama there if you're a really bad shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Yeah, that's good because I really am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=606)|

| 0:12:55| If he's your manager, you have to get that to Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| He said I was good to go, whatever that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| On your task requirement, is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| He's had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| He asked me who the manager of record was, and it's Robert Resmondo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| and he's had the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| He's taken his fingerprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| No, it's Peter Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Yeah, I've got two managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Peter Brown is the only one I have down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Peter has not taken task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Robert Resmondo, who is the manager of the location we're opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| he has had the task class, fingerprints, and background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| He is not a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| He is not listed as a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| So I need to change his list as a manager, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| We need an application form from him, from both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| Councilwoman Pivo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| You, when you're successful in getting this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| We open in about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Unfortunately, a couple of very important things are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=831)|
| 0:14:00| What am I missing besides that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Well, we have, your manager has not taken task certification class, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Yes, ma'am, he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| And also, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| He has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| The application that says who the manager is has not taken class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| When I put Peter Brown on that, it was like eight weeks ago perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Well, unfortunately, for your sake, it would have been wise to have updated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| and gotten it ready for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| That's why I talked to McNutt on Thursday, and he said I was good to go because of Robert Resmondo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| I can explain it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Sir, you don't have that manager listed with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| So I guess I wasn't good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| No, he does not count, and Mr. Brown has not been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| I haven't seen Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| He has to be fingerprinted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Is that not good to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| No, you're not good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| You make your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Well, I think you've got a paperwork snafu that's pretty serious that you've got to work out before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| I think even before we can buy our own policies, issue you a permit, you were hoping to open in three weeks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| We will be opening on April 21st as our opening day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| What's our, does somebody have a calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| When's our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| The 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| The 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I think about then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| I don't think we meet, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| We'll check on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| We meet again on April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Well, excuse me, of course we meet on the 7th or the 8th and then the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| So, unfortunately, the 21st would not be an opening date unless we can resolve these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| You can open and not serve beer until the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| Whatever you tell me I've got to do is I've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Well, actually, it would be the 23rd because we would be after the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| So, we'd be glad for you to come back on the 22nd of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| So, I just need to do the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Well, you need to get your manager's applications into Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Wanda, can you give me a place list wherever else I may need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| If you'll just come see Wanda or call the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Can I send Robert, because I live in Kingsport, it's a pretty good little drive for me to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Robert, can you come do that in April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I don't know Robert, but I suppose that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| He'll be the manager at the Peters Road site, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| If we get a motion to postpone this to the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| I move to postpone, oh, dear, this Mexican grill until April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Touche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Until April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| You got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I know you love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1024)|

| 0:17:43| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Just ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Blair Bryant is a manager for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| He apparently, according to our records, still owes some money in city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| That's not a factor in this, but if you could get after him to pay that, that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1081)|

| 0:18:53| No one's been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| We're still waiting on the approval from the Building Inspector and Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| but we have a measurement issue here that the Board may want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| The issue is the Tyson House, and the issue is whether or not that's a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1149)|
| 0:19:18| There is a facility that had a beer permit when the Tyson House was there, but it closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1158)|
| 0:19:28| and the succeeding business did not have a beer permit, so it is not a preexisting nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| When that previous business got the beer permit, the issue was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| and the council or the beer board at that time concluded that it was not a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| and issued the beer permit, but that is an issue for the beer board to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1187)|
| 0:19:56| Mr. Swanson, how exactly do we determine whether or not the Tyson House is a church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| I'm very familiar with their programming, and I would weigh in that they were a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| but I do not know what the legal definition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| We don't have a separate legal definition for church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| and since we do not have a separate legal definition for church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| you rely on the dictionary definition of church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| and frankly I didn't bring the dictionary with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Well, they do have a full-time priest who is chaplain assigned to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| and they serve Eucharist more than once a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| and conduct activities that I would certainly consider deeming of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1226)|
| 0:20:35| You have to decide, and I'm not going to tell you what the answer to the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| but I will certainly assume this is going to be postponed because they hadn't been in for processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| and if that assumption is correct, I'll be happy to bring a dictionary with me when I come next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| I can look it up if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| That would be fine, too, if you're going to consider it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| although there's really no reason to if you're going to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Yeah, it would just be a point of information tonight, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| I don't think it's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Would it be appropriate to request a letter from the Diocese of East Tennessee in terms of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| or not the bishop considers this a church in terms of the Episcopal Church's programming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| It's really your call as opposed to the bishop's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| It's not the bishop's call as to whether it is a church or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| but if you would find that helpful, then you certainly may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| But the bishop has been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Counselman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Well, I guess it sounds like you'd sort of like to know the answer to this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| about whether you're allowed to have a beer permit before you go through the expenses of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| I don't know, Mr. Swanson, if we're even allowed to decide this question without the question being on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1295)|
| 0:21:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Well, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| The applicant is sort of asking if Tyson House is a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| they don't need to proceed with an application and the hassle of getting to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| And my question to you is are we allowed to determine that question before there's a question on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Are we allowed to say, yes, we think Tyson House is a church, don't even bother applying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| or can we give them a definitive at this moment, you don't have an application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| It's up to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| And while courts don't give advisory opinions, if the beer board chooses to give an advisory opinion, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| It also could point out that should they elect to get a liquor permit, then that issue becomes moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| Oh, that's an interesting advisory opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Well, we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| I hadn't thought of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Counselman Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| So we are going to decide whether or not this is a church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| You may if you choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| I don't really recommend it, but you may if you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| You don't recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| No, I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Because it may become mooted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Counselman Harkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Well, let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| If it doesn't become mooted, one reason why it may not be considered a church is that they don't have membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1378)|
| 0:23:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| That's one way of looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Tyson House is more of an Episcopal outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| It's a ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| I'm just saying that's one way of looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| I have always considered it a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| It looks like a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| And there are services that are going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| but perhaps it's treated differently because there's no regular membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1408)|
| 0:23:37| Counselman Harkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| The definition is basically what you would think it would be, the dictionary definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| A building set apart or consecrated for public worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| Counselman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Mr. Swanson, maybe you can enlighten us with a little history here on why this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| why this is in place, why the law would include distances to church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| sort of the, you know, why would funeral homes, churches, why would they have to have a certain distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| And what I'm getting to is what kind of activities are we trying to avoid, goings-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| I mean, I think I understand that why you don't have certain licenses to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| or do certain things near churches and funeral homes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| But if you could just sort of, from your perspective, you know, what's the intent of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| I mean, if you don't have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Were you around when this was written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Because, I mean, I'm just looking for a little, you know, background into why it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| I mean, I think I know, but I wanted to hear from a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| I will concede that I am older than seems absolutely necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| but I was not around when that particular ordinance was drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| and so I'm not privy to what went on at the time that that was drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| And probably anything that I offered you in that respect would be speculation as to why it was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| and probably your speculation is just as good as mine with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| I was around, I think, as I recall, when they adopted the provision that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| if you get a liquor permit, the distance requirements do not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| And, frankly, the reason they did that was because the concept was if you can buy liquor and drink liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to prohibit beer, which is, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| tends to be less potent than the liquor anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| You're forcing people to drink liquor rather than beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| So that was the thought process behind that, even though there is a counterargument to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| I think counsel sort of got to where I'm going with it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| if you have a membership assembling and you have certain regularly scheduled activities with church people coming and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1550)|
| 0:26:00| you don't want sort of other activities conflicting with what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| trying to keep the environment clean and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| And I was just looking, you know, a little bit back into the intent and the origin of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I guess, Mr. Swanson, I want to kind of challenge you on your advice that we not give an advisory opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| It feels to me like we've got a person here who said, I'm confused about the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| and I want to ask the beer board what they think before I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| create work for myself and a hard discussion for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| I don't know if it, as a policy matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| I think it would actually be smart for us to give an opinion about whether this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| And I guess that's a question for other members of the beer board, but I think it would be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Mr. Becker, I would counter that for this businessman, and I would have to confer with Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| but if we would decide tonight that, in fact, the Tyson House is a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and then we're forced under that assumption to deny the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| then does that circumvent his ability to get a liquor permit and ultimately open his business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| I mean, is there a year waiting period with a denial or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Well, you can determine the issue of whether or not Tyson House is a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| without actually voting to either grant or deny the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| You can determine that issue and then postpone the matter if that's what you choose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| And, again, I'm not saying that you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| I'm just saying if it were up to me, I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Honestly, I don't think it would be fair to determine whether or not it is a church tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| I'd like to hear from someone from Tyson House because I would hate to go on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1660)|
| 0:27:49| the people here's knowledge tonight of the situation, us turn around and determine it's not a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| Someone from the Tyson House comes in at a later date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| and gives this litany of examples of why they're a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| and we kick ourselves because we didn't make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| Councilman Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I guess, I mean, I think you're right, Mr. Frost, on if we make that determination it's not a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| I almost feel like if we're going to say it's a church with the evidence we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| we're not going to change that opinion in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| I mean, I don't see more information convincing us it's not a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| And I think the fellow's got a legitimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| If we know Tyson House is a church, and I tend to agree with Ms. Roddy that it's a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| I don't know if I would, I think it's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| So maybe it's just if we're convinced it's a church, I think we ought to let him know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| But I don't feel strongly about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Well, I'm just looking, you know, at the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| It obviously says nearest church on here, and it's spelled out Tyson House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| And I'm wondering, you know, the person that filled this out, how did they determine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and where did they get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| That was from the zoning, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I'm just wondering, you know, if someone looked at records or asked someone from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| or did they go out and look around and ask or talk to people on the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| You know, I think I know why this is on here, but that has a lot to do with what we think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| You know, I just really think it's prudent for us to postpone this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1769)|
| 0:29:39| and give ourselves time to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| I think there are a number of reasons for not making any decision this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| And I think it's in the Board's best interest, the Beer Board's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| I think it will give this gentleman an opportunity to consider what's in his best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| And so I'm going to move that this be postponed until the April Beer Board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Well, I mean, we're not going to have, like, a bar or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| This is just a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I mean, we have, like, a cutoff limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| And I was just wanting to know exactly how it got passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I think it was DAX that had the beer permit before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| How was that passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| And we can't go any farther with the Tyson House being there the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| I mean, because we have a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| The main focus is a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| All we're trying to do is just also give that option is all we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| We do not have a bar in place at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Neither of you have been in for processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| so we're going to postpone to the next Beer Board meeting anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| And so, in the interim, we'll try to get a better determination of whether that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| But regardless of whether it's an issue, you need to take care of the processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| Both yourself and Mr. Loftus need to come in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| And this will be heard at the next regular Beer Board meeting in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| I just have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| So, at the next meeting, if you decide it is a church, is it going to be postponed again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| Should I go ahead and go towards getting a liquor license, or what should I go about doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=1880)|

| 0:35:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| Now it's time on our agenda for the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Sapphire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Aaron Thompson, 428 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| You're here because you've had several underage, two underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| And to present us with a plan of what you intend to do to prevent this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| We have put in about four different implementations to make sure it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| We have immediately after the last citation, we took immediate action punishing people that were involved in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2159)|
| 0:36:09| to set an example for the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Second thing we did was we contacted Top Shelf, which is a company that does ID recognition classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| and we had the whole entire staff come in and take a class to learn how to ID people, how to check fake IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| or how to catch fake IDs, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| And everybody had to take a comprehensive exam, and everybody passed, including management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| The third thing we did was add extra security personnel on the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| so now we have two instead of one to help check IDs as they're coming in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| And the fourth thing we did was we now have an ink stamping method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| Whenever people come in, they get carded and their hand gets stamped on top of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| So we put on several layers of security just to make sure that it didn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Yeah, let me just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| We get a little record here, just a line on each violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| You had one on 9-1-2007 and one on 3-23-2007, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| According to our record, the one on 9-1-2007 was carded at the door but not by the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| What happened on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| That's an instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| We have security personnel at the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| and that particular security person was not at the front door at his post trying to check the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| All the servers inside are supposed to check IDs also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| It's very critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| We tell everybody to card whenever they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Security guy didn't card, and neither did the – well, according to the – it was the bartender, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| According to the bartender, she said that she didn't card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| because she felt like the security personnel at the front door was supposed to card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| So that's why she didn't card, and that's immediately why we took the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| why I had everybody take the class right after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| just so that kind of situation didn't occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| That security person was, in fact, let go because that's the only job he has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| and he wasn't doing his job, and she was suspended on top of that as well in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| And then the other one – and you might be looking at them backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| The March one, and there's, I guess, that September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| That was – now, I'll tell you, on the very first citation we got, we had no security at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| So we didn't have anybody carding at that time except the servers and the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| So we added that extra layer of security, one security personnel at the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| In that instance, that particular gentleman didn't do his job, obviously, and that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| So on the first citation, we added one security person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| On the second citation, we added two security persons just to make sure that everybody's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| you know, you've got somebody to watch that person at all times on top of the staff inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| without carding anybody that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| So that – I hope that explains it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Councilman Helzquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| I think you've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I was just trying to make sure that all the measures that you had stated at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| you said, you know, we've done – you listed off a series of things that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| It sounds like most of those, if not all of those, have been done since the second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| They will – everything I mentioned in the beginning was done directly right after the second citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| After the first citation, we added the extra security person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| We started posting little notes above every terminal and put them in server's books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| please card, please card, please card, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| We have our managers go and just tell people before their shifts, please card, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| And, you know, we took the punishment of the staff seriously because it needed to set an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| and try to show people that we're serious about carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| And that was part of the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| So, yeah, everything was implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| The first four things were implemented directly after that last citation, which was Stephanie Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Well, the two citations are just under six months apart, if I'm reading correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| And this board, this billboard is at times with two citations that are that close together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| at times is centered on for suspension revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| It's a discretionary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| We don't always do that, but we sometimes do depending on the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| And, you know, it's sort of difficult to pigeonhole anything and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| you have to judge it on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| But we've also, I will tell you, and I'm sure you're somewhat aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| usually when it's gone to when we see three citations in any kind of reasonable proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| time-wise, we send it on for suspension revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| So consider that no matter what action we take tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| If we don't do that, then it's very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| We take it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| And, you know, the steps we put in place, we really feel nobody's going to be able to get in without being carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| There's just no way that it can happen, really, because we have two people always checking each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| So I'd be very, very surprised if it happened again anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2476)|
| 0:41:26| What was the punishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| The security personnel, his primary job and his only job is to card people, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| because we don't have fights at SAFIRE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| It's not that kind of establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| So he was let go immediately after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| He was told the reasons and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| And, I mean, it's the only thing he has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| So he didn't card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| So I had to let him go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Just that example to my other security guys that, hey, this job is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| You know, it just costs us a lot of money, gets us in other issues, obviously legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| And Stephanie Bell was suspended for two weeks after that was the bartender that also didn't card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| We would have fired her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| We felt he made the larger because that is his primary job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| And I know a lot of places, I don't know how it works at a lot of restaurants around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| or a lot of clubs around town that have security guys carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| You know, a lot of places you go in, only the security cards, and the inside they don't card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| And we try to make sure everybody cards at SAFIRE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| Councilman Romney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| I think one of the things that this board is trying to determine is did you take additional steps, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| after the first citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| And I understand you went from one security person to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Tell us more about how the two security guards work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Are they both at the front door and they check the ID twice or they're backing each other up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| or one's at the front door and one's at the back door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| What's their job assignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Yeah, I'd be happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| The primary way that it works is their eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| And they're always watching for people to try to slip in, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Because, you know, I don't know who's been to SAFIRE, but, you know, you walk in the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| We don't have, like, roped-off area or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| It's just, you know, you have the front patio and then people walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| You can't get in the back door because it's locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Oh, you can't go in the back door anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| It's locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| No, yeah, you may not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| But that second security guy from time to time will go to the back door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| and just keep an eye on it to make sure friends don't let people in, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Legally, we have to allow people to walk out of it, but they can't come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| It doesn't have a door on the outside, the back one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| specifically for the reason that people would try to sneak their underage friends in, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| And, you know, we want to make sure that that never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| You know, we added the extra inking, which is really, really critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| because all you've got to do is see somebody's hand in a specific SAFIRE we had made so nobody can copy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| And, you know, basically the security guys are just all about their eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| and, you know, being able to see if somebody sneaks in the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| the other security guy will see it and he can grab them and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| I need to see your ID and check them, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| We haven't had any issues come up, really, since we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| And then you also asked the servers to card, even if the person's hand is stamped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| the server is supposed to card in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Absolutely, and so are the bartenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| You know, it's the kind of thing where we, the managers that work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| and some of the bartenders are also managers, and we just have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| it's a constant reinforcement kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| And some of the people that work there are, how do you say it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| we just have to keep pushing everybody every day we're in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| And if someone walks up to the bar and orders more than one drink, do you sell it to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| We ask for multiple IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| You have to get multiple IDs for everybody that's over 21, I'm pretty sure, legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| So you can't just…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| So I can't walk up and buy two glasses of wine and take one and give it to my girlfriend who might be underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| No, of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| You'd have to get the second ID for that second person for you to be served two drinks at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| Drinks, two IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Exactly, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| I tend to, I mean, I think it's nice that Joe talked about what we might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| I think, one, sending you to a suspension revocation hearing doesn't necessarily mean you're permitted to suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| or to revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| And I just think if I see two non-carded coming in, I'm going to make a motion to send to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| and I'm going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| I think this is too serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| You've got two of them, and I think we need to talk more seriously about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| The motion did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Is there any other further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| Cool Beans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| I am Danny Dyer, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| I'm the lawyer for Mayrack CBLP, doing business as Cool Beans Restaurant and Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| We're here because you've had two underage sales to minors and to present us with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| of what you intend to do to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| We have submitted a revised plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| We had a plan in place before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| The changes we have made to the plan is that we have also added a person at the door to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| check IDs during those times, and it's important for the council to understand that the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| operates in two basic manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| During the day, and for a large part of the day, it's like any other restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Anyone can go in, and at that time, the server is directly responsible for checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| At a certain time at night, security personnel are posted at the door, and all IDs are checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| before anyone can enter the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| This violation occurred during one of those times, and if memory serves correct, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| on a football weekend, not that that's any excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| The ID was checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| It was the right year but the wrong month, and again, that's not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| It was purely negligence on the security personnel's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| That person was terminated immediately, which has always been our policy and practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| We have, again, to restate what I said earlier, we posted another person there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| We've also come up with, after this violation, a written document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| It's a full-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| It's several paragraphs, and essentially it recites that this person understands that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| A, it is illegal to serve to anyone that's under 21, that they commit that they will not do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| that they will comply with state and local law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| They understand that they can be fined or jailed, that our license can be jeopardized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| that they will be responsible for paying their own fines, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| and that they'll pay our expenses if they cause a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| We continually reinforce this to the staff, and unfortunately this occasion occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| and we hope to keep that to a minimum in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Yeah, let me start at the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Ours lists two violations, one, the football weekend one, and then one in March of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| Now, you said on the football weekend somebody looked at the ID, but they read it wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| which is not what our thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Ours says it was checked at the door, not by the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| So you're saying it was checked by somebody at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| At the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| It was checked at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| And they read it wrong, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| And then the one in March of 2006, ours says nobody checked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| I think that was at a time when the 9 o'clock we have a door guy come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| and he came in in the interim of the 9 o'clock shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| and so unfortunately slipped by before the door guys got there and at the shift change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| and the guys behind the bar that were serving assumed that the door guy had checked his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| So it was just kind of an in-between process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2962)|
| 0:49:32| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| If there's no other questions, I'll go ahead, same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| This IC information here that said we had two not checking, so I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| And, again, sending them to a suspension revocation hearing does not mean a suspension revocation will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| So I'm going to make a motion to send to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3002)|

| 0:50:08| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3010)|

| 0:50:14| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3014)|

| 0:50:16| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Any further, any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| You know, I want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I voted no on both of these suspension and revocation hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| That's not an indication that I'm not very concerned about this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| It just simply is, at this point in time, IC efforts have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3046)|
| 0:50:54| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| A third one is just, it's really deadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| I think somebody said that a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| So, you know, the ball is in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| And from here on, you will make it impossible for anyone to support you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| and to have confidence in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| So I think that's what this billboard is saying, not saying that no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| It is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| It's a big concern to all of us and a big responsibility for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| But I just want you to understand that this is an opportunity to really show us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| that you understand how serious the situation is then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| And this would go the same for the party earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| that we voted not to go to a revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| So thank you for letting me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Councilman Peel, I greatly appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| And we do take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I mean, it's not just a matter of maintaining our beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| I mean, obviously, as counsel to this establishment, there's very obvious liability reasons to prevent this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| And we feel like we're doing everything we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| There is a factor of human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| And I don't say that to excuse this in any respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| I mean, but, you know, you tell somebody to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| In this particular case, a 22-year-old door personnel, I mean, I don't know if you all have 22-year-olds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| but they don't always do what they're told to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| And this was a clear situation involving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| We understand it's our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| We take that obligation very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| If you have to hire older, more mature, more capable people, that is your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| Councilman Hultquist, actually, that is something we have done is simply done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| look for more mature people to put in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| Tremendous responsibility to put on a 22-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| I have two grandchildren that age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| I've already raised children that age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| It's a very difficult age to accept that kind of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| So finding a way to make that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| and not putting that on the shoulders of the young, who it's very difficult for them to make those judgments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| and decisions, probably a wise idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| Cargo Oil Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| Jim Peery, 3410 Tipton Station Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| You're here because you've had two underage sales to minors and to present us with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| It's what you do, intend to do, to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| We've installed at the location on Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| we've installed a 16-camera surveillance system to more closely monitor our own employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| We've asked that all employees, not just the manager, attend and be certified through the TAST program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| In this case, we've asked it to monitor our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| and tell them not to interfere with other employees during the sale of alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| unless there's a threat of violence or a need to interrupt for someone's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3226)|
| 0:53:58| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Mr. Peery, according to our records, the most recent citation was in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| and it indicates that the cadet was carded, but the age verification process was bypassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| Can you explain how your cashier was able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| The way I understood it, the officer approached one cashier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| and she put it into the computer correctly and did not sell alcohol to the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| I think she did it a second time, and the cash register will not accept incorrect birth dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| That's when the second cashier interjected herself and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| let me look at the ID and see if you've run that up correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| and stated he's the same age as my son, he's okay to buy beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| and it was the second cashier who actually sold the alcohol to the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| So there's a manual override where you can reenter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| She then went and reentered a new birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| She just put in another date, obviously, but she should not have interjected herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| And that allowed the transaction to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| And she's since been terminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| She was terminated that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| I'm going to move that this be sent to suspension revocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| simply because, as in the other cases that we've heard tonight, you had two, both within 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| And, again, this doesn't necessarily indicate that your permit will be suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| but the Spear Board does take these offenses very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| It's very dangerous for underage people to get a hold of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Mr. Mitchell, you might as well call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3343)|

| 0:55:48| Chairman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3348)|

| 0:56:00| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3362)|

| 0:56:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Maryland makes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Thanks for your time, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080325?start=3368)|
