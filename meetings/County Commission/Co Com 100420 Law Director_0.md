| 0:00:56| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| I'm here!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| My wife overlooks me a lot, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=65)|

| 0:01:12| Clerk, would you read number two, please, for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| A resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| appointing Chief Deputy Knox County Law Director Joseph G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| to the position of emergency interim successor to former Knox County law director, William S. Lockett, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=83)|
| 0:01:31| Resolution 10-4-101, special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| Make a motion to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| We have a motion and a second. Any questions? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| Opposed? The ayes have it. Congratulations, Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| With regards to the appointment process, would it be feasible for us to, at our meeting on the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| to go ahead and set a date for resumes to be accepted and perhaps a public hearing so that we can go ahead and formalize the process later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| Definitely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| You have 120 days from April 8th to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| I think the 26th would be the exact time, good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| Commissioner, I don't know if that's Ivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| I want to know, is Greg McKay still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| No, he went back to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Okay. I had a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| Any other? Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| There's a clause in there that says 45 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| And I think Mr. McKay was wanting to see if we could put in there 60 days because of the early ballots that they have to send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| That's on the new ordinance that they're talking about for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| He wanted to make sure we had that covered in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| You know that he's doing that because they are not able to get the ballots out and count military ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| This may be something we want to address at the same time and we might be able to address it slightly differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| These other offices are also, particularly the mayor's, is also 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| Do we want to change it in the charter for all those offices to change it to 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| And maybe in Section 8, which deals with the law director, just say he will be appointed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| per whatever part of the charter that becomes, just like all the other officers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| He's actually back in the room now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Let's change it to 60 days for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| I believe that's what he suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Greg, do you want to come down and say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| I can have that ready for Monday if the commission so desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| But I think the thing is we may want to do it for all the offices in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Yes, sir, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Likewise, I can get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| But we probably still have to follow whatever state law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| And it may be that we just change it to we follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| Greg, the question I had a while ago before you stepped out was about the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| You said 45 days, but you wanted 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Can you explain a little bit of what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| We mail the military overseas ballots 45 days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| We're required by law to send them by 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| So you'll be tying our hands if the deadline is 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| If you made it 60, we could work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| That would give us time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Because you've got to have a qualifying deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| If there's a vacancy, you have to have a qualifying deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| And the state law allows for a short and qualified deadline in a situation like this, which would be a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| And then three days to drop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| And then three or four days for us to get a ballot printed, approved, printed and delivered to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| So 60 days would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| So we will do that Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Can we do that Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Is that something the law director can answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Done, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| He must like this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I need a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| You can just stay down and sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| We'll come back in about ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100420lawdirector?start=304)|
