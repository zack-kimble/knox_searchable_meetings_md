| 0:09:27| The state rates them in critical, poor, fair, good, so all of ours are in fair good, so I think that speaks well to the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=567)|
| 0:09:37| We have almost 9,000 culverts, so we are implementing a maintenance program to try to address some of those larger ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| so that those critical waterways we're being proactive on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| Just a little bit about the highway department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| There's 88 people in that department that are out there every day mowing and ditching and patching roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=593)|
| 0:10:01| so that's the folks that are out there doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| Annual budget for that department is about $14.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| About half of that is asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| A little over close to $7 million of that is just putting paving on the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| The other half is broke down approximately in about a quarter of contracts like striping and guardrail safety improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=618)|
| 0:10:29| and then the other quarter is the salaries of those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| This gives us an idea of what our roads look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| It's not quite one-thirds, but it's fairly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| Essentially, 33% of our roads in Knox County are what you would consider collectors and arterials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| the major roads in our community that carry the people to and from where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| The other two-thirds of that are local streets, the streets that are the dead ends and the streets that get you to your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| The concern there, one of the concerns that we have, and we're going to talk about that later and try to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| is almost half of our streets are 26-foot-wide cul-de-sacs in subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| We can talk a little bit more about that, but those are really wide streets that cost a lot to maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| and to maintain the good roads we have, we've got some strategies that we're going to try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| to reduce those widths, shorten those, and just do some different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| That's a concern that we're trying to work on as we move forward with Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| This is something we talk about every month, acceptance of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| This is a per-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| You can see there's some years there that we didn't have many, especially that 21 was kind of a COVID year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| But you can see about nine miles a year is what we accept, and these are all 26-foot-wide subdivision streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=716)|
| 0:12:04| This particular month, I added them up, we're accepting 1.5 miles of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| Just to give you an idea, it's pretty consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Nine and ten miles a year of new roadway we're accepting per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| This talks about what it costs in today's dollars to repave that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| The note up there at the top is in today's dollars to mill and pave that 1.5 miles is $322,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| One thing I would like to note on this, you see the cost to repave one mile of subdivision is $215,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| That's almost double than what you see those others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| The difference is the milling that has to be done on those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| As you know, there's a curb on those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| To prevent water from intruding down people's driveways and creating problems, we have to mill it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| As you see, oftentimes on the interstate, there's a big machine that grinds up the pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| That correlates to about $50,000 a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| The paving of that is somewhere around $150,000, and the milling is about $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| Once again, it goes back to long-term costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| We need to be really cautious and strategic about how we accept and maintain these larger subdivision streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Here's the good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Our consultant that we had do our pavement management, they took a van with lasers and high digital imagery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=809)|
| 0:13:40| and they drove every road in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| There's something called overall condition index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| It's just like a grade score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| It's zero to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Obviously, 100 is brand-new, freshly paved road, and zero is gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| It's completely failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Our roads are average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| If you add up all the segments, we're 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| It's actually an ASTM standard, American Association of Testing Materials Lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=842)|
| 0:14:11| They rate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| The health of our system is good, so we want to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| This is just to give you a visual indication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| This is from the ASTM standard, where it kind of gives you a visual description of what those roads look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| It's pretty evident between excellent and failed, but the distinction between the good and the fairs and the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| this will kind of help you as you navigate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I guess that was where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| This is kind of where we've been and some of the challenges with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Currently, for the longest time, asphalt was very cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| We'll talk about that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| When it's cheap, you can pave your way out of that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| We did a worse first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| We started at the worst roads, and we paved them, and were able to keep them in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| But there's a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| The problem is the price of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| As you can see, when I started at the county, actually, it's not even on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| It's so far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| In 2001, asphalt was $24 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Today, it's $116 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| That's a 370% increase, so we've got to be very strategic about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| As you can see, it's a gradual increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| and don't really necessarily see it going down in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| This just represents the number of road miles paved per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| pretty much an inverse of the previous graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| As asphalt went up, the road miles have went down, which is problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| but there's some things that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| The next slide is kind of where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| what we'd like to do to combat these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| There are several things we're doing, pavement management being one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| more treatment options being one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Primarily, we were just paving streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Well, that's good, but with the limited resources we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| we need to be looking at different surface treatments to extend lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| so that we don't wait until it gets paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Then the proactive approach that we're talking about through advanced NOx,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| accepting roads that are more densely compact, as well as narrower streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| This is something I know some of you commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| I know Commissioner Daly's asked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| and we're trying to get this on a dashboard for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| This is the internal workings of our pavement management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| It's called Cartograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| We can go in and you can see every road in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| has a line segment associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| and this particular section of Greenwell rates an OCI 3971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| It gives us a lot of factors about what it would cost to repave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| and different things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| So it's a very handy tool that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| and we're going to make that available to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| so that you can see exactly what numerical score the roads in your districts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| and ultimately want to get that out to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| so that they can see that we're being good stewards of their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| This is really pavement management in the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| The next slide talks about the graph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| but really just about thinking differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| As roads oxidize, that asphalt oxidizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| It's really black when you first put it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| and over three or four years it starts to oxidize, to gray out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| We need to start putting sealcoats and cape seals on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| That's something that we can do that is a fraction of the cost of paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| that extends the life not as much as a new pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| but extends it seven or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| So the goal is to try to catch these roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| to where we can use less expensive treatments and extend the life cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| This shows you there's two curves here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| One is the break point between good and fair, and then fair to poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| What we've done in the past is we've been down there in that yellow-red area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| That's when the road needs to be repaved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| and we're repaving it at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| But what we want to do to be more proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| is to catch it up there in that green and yellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| and to put a different type of treatment option on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| whereas a mill and overlay is $15 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| A cape seal is like $2 to $3 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| So you can see a big difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| So that's some of the things that, through a pavement management perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| we can do to continue the good condition of our roadways with the budget we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| And this is really, I think, kind of probably the most important thing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| is what does our current budget look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Because this cartograph system we use, it can let us run scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| using different allocations of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| So right now our OCI is 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| I think we want to maintain that good condition of roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| So to do that and to use our current approach, pave worse first, it's $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| Well, I know I'm not going to get $13 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| so I need to think about a different way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| So one of the things that we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| is by using these other techniques that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| and being more strategic with our investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| we can maintain that 71 for about $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| And thankfully, we're very close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| And with the state aid funding that we're going to get, we will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| So we can maintain that 71 for the foreseeable future with that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Now, as asphalt increases, we'd have to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| But I guess the good thing is, is through pavement management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| we're able to maintain a good level of roadway condition with the budget we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| And we can run scenarios that show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| And obviously, like you said, you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| if we wanted to improve our network, we can, but that's going to cost X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| And if anybody has any questions about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| we can talk about those different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| So next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| And this is just one of those ways that we're trying to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| And a lot of you all have seen this slide through Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| If we can develop in a different fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| we're going to reduce our overall street surface by 25% over the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1275)|
| 0:21:23| In addition to that, one of the things we want to do is look at narrower streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| And if we go from just a 26 to a 20-foot wide street, that's another 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| So just be good, sound, fiscal, responsible agents of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| These are the things that we're trying to do to make sure that we're being wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| with our money of the taxpayer that trusts us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| And I think that may be the last slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| So hopefully that touched on most of the things that you all might have had issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| or questions with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| I'll be happy to entertain any questions or provide any additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Commissioner Frazier, it's all your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| I'll yield my time until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Good information, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Could you send this to us electronically first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Oh, you did already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| If you can't find it, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| But I'll send it to you in a PDF form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Okay, I'll double-check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| It may have just gotten filtered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Does the pavement management system take into consideration the traffic load?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| So, for instance, Cedar Bluff is going to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| 100 times more traffic than the next arterial over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| or does it just look at the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| I mean, do you factor that in to sort of go here's our –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| because I know you and I have looked at heat maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| and we've looked at traffic congestion maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| and we've seen sort of proactively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| whereas you may have a subdivision once every 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| you've got to pave that one every four or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| It does, and I didn't get into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Each pavement section has a deterioration curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and that deterioration curve on Cedar Bluff is much more drastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| than McCammon Road, the road I live on, because it don't have much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| So, yes, we do look at that based on a deterioration curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| because it ages quicker due to the traffic load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Jim, tell us a little bit more about the state aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| The state takes care of bridges over 20 hemi-feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Are they still doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| The state, every two years, inspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| The state considers any structure that, as you drive across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| at greater than 20 feet in length is a bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| anything less than that is a culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| And you're right, Commissioner Daley, they inspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| They just got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| They do it in even years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| They inspect all our bridges, every county, state bridge in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| and give us a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| They do give us some funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| but we have to share that funding with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| But, thankfully, we didn't have any in this year that were rated poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| So most of our stuff will be more routine maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| scouring, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| But we do have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| There are some state aid funds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| but we do have to share those with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| The state aid in paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| explain how that works and how much that the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| that we pay, really, in gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| We're paying for it, but we don't have to pay the full load up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| It's allocated based on population and road miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Obviously, we have 1,700 lane or centerline miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| That's a lot more than most of the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| So we get a good portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Our typical allocation on state aid is about $550,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| This upcoming year, with the governor's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| that allocation is going to be much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| It's going to be over probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| We still haven't got that exact number yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| but it's definitely going to be a big bonus for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| That money, we can use it for bridges, paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Paving is what we traditionally use it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| but there's a lot of latitude for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Even if we wanted to build a turn lane with it, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| And it's matched at 98.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| So essentially it's almost free money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Ms. Farrar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I hope I said that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| I'm just wondering how emergency vehicles would navigate narrower roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| since that's one of your plans, to improve the road maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| And it's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| I'm sure Mr. Bagwell is going to speak next up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| and me and him were talking about that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| We have a lot of roads that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| we like to see all our roads 17, 18 feet wide to allow for that 8-foot-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| you know, large fire truck to pass, but you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| We have a lot of roads that are 13, 14-foot-wide that serve as collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| So it's a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| and one of the things we're doing at Advanced Knox is looking at ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| to have a better, more strategic transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| and assign some minimum width characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| So the road I live on is 13-foot wide, so I know the feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Ms. Mews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| Could you talk a little bit more about where anyone could report potholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| or road damages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| We have an online system, C-Click Fix, that's on your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| You can download the app and take a picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| It geolocates your phone, and it automatically notifies us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| So that's for somebody that wants to use the newer technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| but if you just want to call 215-5800,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| there's somebody that answers that call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| We have people that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| if there's a hazardous location reported to us at 2 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| that person will go out and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| So 24-7 service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| I just wanted to thank Director Snowden for putting this together for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| and to thank you and your team for always looking for ways to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| and maintain our existing roadways because, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| with growth comes additional stress on our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| And we all know that it's very difficult to keep our revenues in pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| with growth and the needs that it places on us as officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| to provide those public services to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1684)|

| 0:28:32| If you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1712)|

| 0:28:45| I'd just like to read you Clause 2 of the original warranty deed for my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| This was written in 1927.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| That this set of premises shall not be sold to Negroes nor any of the colored races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| It shall not be occupied by Negroes nor any of the colored races other than servants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| of the owner for a period of nine, nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| So that that clause had not been for civil rights legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| would still be in effect today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Driving here to this commission meeting, I live in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| and I travel mainly, it's 3.5 miles, I travel mainly on Kingston bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| and I have to pass by Bleak House every time I come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| And Bleak House is better known as Confederate Memorial Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| And that is run by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Chapter 89,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| a tax-exempt organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| I used to be in the Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| My specialty was psychological operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| And I can tell you that the UDC is widely known as the world's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| the history's most effective propaganda operation ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| And just a passage from Karen Cox's Dixie Daughters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| pretty much the seminal history of the UDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Cornelia Branch Stone, who eventually became president general of the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| organization, prepared the UDC catechism for children in 1904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Leaders asked questions from Stone's catechism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| and children responded as they had been taught in their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| What causes led to the war between the states from 1861 to 1865,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| asked the daughter in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| The disregard on the part of the states of the north for the right of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| southern or slave-holding states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| The children were admonished to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| What were these rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| The right to regulate their own affairs and to hold slaves as property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| How were the slaves treated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| With great kindness and care in nearly all cases, a cruel master being rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| So I would like to thank you for supporting Commissioner Lundy's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| to honor Black History Month, especially considering the time we're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| our delegates in the state legislature are literally vilifying the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| that's in that resolution and passing bills to prevent medical schools from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| issuing licenses, if they do the things that you are supporting in that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| So thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| But I bring this information to you during Black History Month to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| you as the people that hold power in this county to look for opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| to help black people in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| It's not enough for us to simply look at the achievements of black Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| We have to look at the systems that are continuing to hold them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| This is not critical race theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I'm not trying to make anybody feel bad about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| But it's just a plain fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| The warranty deed on my house would still be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| We are giving tax exemptions on I would estimate the most valuable piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1911)|
| 0:31:59| property in Knox County is not paying taxes, and it's owned by a racist organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| So going forward, when you do see the opportunities to help people in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| County that are black, recognize those opportunities and take them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| and help them fight the systems that are holding them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| Thank you for your time, and Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=1945)|

| 0:33:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| I think this would be a good time to remind the body that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| approximately $215,000 of repaving that will be required of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| in 15 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And that's one reason that I do try to bring that to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| because the revenue to support the cost of repaving is post-factum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| meaning the infrastructure breaks down before we receive the revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| And so we are putting that burden on the future elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| and future leaders of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| So I just want us to be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| And, again, that's why I really appreciate Director Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2069)|

| 0:37:33| I just was wondering, just a brief explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| I certainly know and trust the board's decision on this, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| also looking at item number 16, which is asking us to authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| the Innovate Schools model grant for $23,500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2269)|
| 0:37:58| My first question is, does this $1,500,000 come out of the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| grant, or is that extra money, more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| That is not extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| The architecture fees, that is not extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| The totality of the construction itself is not extra money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| So it is part of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| And could you just briefly tell us what the Innovative School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| model grant is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2309)|

| 0:38:36| questions about construction or the RFQ process, I'll certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2316)|

| 0:38:51| little while, but they've been a competitive grant process in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| past as part of the Governor's initiative to really support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| greater post-secondary preparation, college and career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2338)|

| 0:39:02| This year, they actually launched a set of noncompetitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| grants that totaled an amount of $1 million per what we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| traditional high school, and then $500,000 per middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| What you're seeing before the board tonight is actually the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| initial application for those grant dollars, and looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| projects and things that are outlined in that grant are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| really kind of our first stab, if you will, at what we think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| money will be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| So we've had some consultation out with our schools that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| kind of some engaged now in our 865 academies and looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| that work, some that are planning future forward to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2375)|

| 0:40:06| For the middle schools primarily, again, focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| career preparation and awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| A lot of them are doing different kind of technology and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| career exposure labs, looking at different ways they can bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| in maybe virtual experiences and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| But the grant dollars are actually a four-year rollout of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| We're going to use some of those funds as well to extend some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| positions that we started under ESSER, the college and career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| readiness support positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| So we'll be able to extend those for another full year and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| another 75%, I think, can be done of those positions in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| additional fourth year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| We don't have, I wouldn't say any of those projects are 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| finalized yet, because we're at the application phase, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| had to put together a proposal, just big picture of what we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| The spirit of the grant really is about reimagining space and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| time of day and partnerships and how they impact the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Because we were already engaged in the career-themed academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| and the build-out of the 865 academies, the state allowed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| to apply for a waiver because there actually was a cap on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| much we could use towards construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| But because we were already engaged heavily in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| partnership building work and really reimagining the high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| school experience, they're allowing us to go above that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| threshold a bit for the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| So stop right there, because that was part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| So some of this is actually being used for capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Oh, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Wonderful, wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| And did I hear you say, is this amount coming every year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| No, that's the totality of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Oh, that's the totality over the four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Like I said, a million dollars per high school, 500,000 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2501)|

| 0:41:49| Is there any more discussion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2516)|

| 0:42:00| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2520)|

| 0:42:23| If I may, Madam Chair, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| Those two were actually combined together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| So motion to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2556)|

| 0:42:44| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| This is item number 18, resolution R-23-2-209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| It's a resolution approving a fund balance designation general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2575)|

| 0:43:08| Is there a motion for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Motion to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Who would want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| In our finance committee meeting, Ron McPherson mentioned that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| total expenditures for textbooks was a million, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| $11,700,000 with $4.2 million coming from your ESSRA funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2621)|
| 0:43:50| So my question is we've given every Knox County student a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| laptop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Why are we still buying textbooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Can we not buy the software that can be loaded onto those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| computers to be used instead of buying a physical book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| So the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| And actually we do a combination of that across different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| textbooks and things that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| There is still a cost associated with that through licensing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| intellectual property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| So the textbook companies don't necessarily give you a price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| break because it's a book versus an online resource material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| If anything, it makes those materials more flexible and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| updatable over time, I would say in that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| But it really doesn't change the need for updating textbooks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| instructional materials against the standards and the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| cycles put forth by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| So how many of this of the $11.7 million is in hard copy books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| I don't have that statistic, but I could get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| But again, I would say that if we went full electronic resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| there would still be considerable cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| When you look at adopting, the bulk of this budget is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| mathematics adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| That is up through the cycle with the state this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| So, again, whether we went in paper resources or electronic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| we would still have a substantial cost for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Commissioner Skidmaker, my junior commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Ms. L over here at Bearden High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| says she has zero hard copy books and it is all digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| I've kind of got an off-the-wall question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| This is more of a curiosity question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| As AI becomes more prevalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| do you guys have a strategy to change with the times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| As AI becomes more prevalent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| You would have me out in deep water trying to talk to you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| artificial intelligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| But I certainly, I mean, that's worth, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2766)|

| 0:46:15| Currently, what we fall under as far as how we adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| are against state set cycles for standards changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| and for textbook adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| And so we follow policy as set by them currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Mr. Shelton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| I just have a question as to where else this money could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| if it wasn't used for online or hardbook textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Well, again, that would be a better question probably for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| I mean, any number of things that you could decide to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| $7.5 million on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| We can make a long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| But at the end of the day, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| as you look at trying to provide a high-quality curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| across the grade bands in our mathematics classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| ensuring that there's a progression of student learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| across the standards so that students arrive at high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| in an Algebra I, Algebra Ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| and ready to access those higher-level maths, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| part-time, part-time, part-time, part-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| part-time, part-time, part-time, part-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| part-time, part-time, part-time, part-time, part-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| ready to access those higher-level maths, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| part of that is in how we approach our instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| ensuring teachers have the materials in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| the training in hand, and have the understanding of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| to make that a process that exists across the grade bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| So we certainly think it's important and certainly think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| those resources are well used in terms of adopting curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| and adopting instructional materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| But you could make a laundry list of how you could spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| $7.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| So in other words, if you do have a hard copy book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| that Knox County Schools purchases for the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| are they all sent out to all the different schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| so that your supply depot would have zero books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| in their inventory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I'm sure there is a certain amount of inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| that's kept for growth and for different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| Again, I could tell you what our pattern has been on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I would have to talk to a few folks that are in charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| of the actual purchasing of all those different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| departmental resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| I'm sure there's a small amount of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| But for the most part, yes, our resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| are located at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| The motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| with a second by Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2916)|

| 0:48:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=2921)|

| 0:50:13| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I had asked to have this pulled because I was just interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| in knowing where this really extra $100,000 was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| And I did get an email from the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| which I very much appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| that informed me that it's part of an annual overtime grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| for five officers to work drug-related cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| with the DEA and FBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Each officer can make up to $19,000 a year in overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| Then our Sheriff's Office pays them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| and they request reimbursement from the FBI DEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| So this is not an out-of-pocket expense for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3064)|

| 0:51:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| I had a couple of questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| It seems like I recall that there was a memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| of understanding at some point with a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| who developed several of the subdivisions in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| actually causing the need for this turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Dr. Snowden, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| What happened and why are we footing the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Sure, yeah, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| And you're correct, we did got into conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| with an MOU and unfortunately those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| kind of fell apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| But just to give you a real brief summary on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| there's two developments that are in Knox County West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| on Fritz and Hatmaker Roads that turn off of Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| And when they were approved, their traffic impact studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| identified the need for a left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| for Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| So the developments were over here and the main road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| that they had joined was over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| so it's kind of off-site improvements were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| So MPC assigned those conditions to two separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| pardon me, three separate developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| but two developers, one developer was common with the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| And after we approached them about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| the developers indicated to us that there was no authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| for us to enforce that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| because the off-site improvements were contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| within the town boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| and that Knoxville-Knox County Planning is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| obviously the town is not part of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| So Amy Brooks and I, we talked to I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| the former law director at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| and got his opinion as well as Steve Wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| the former director of, pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| the former attorney for the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| and they both concurred that that was factual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| that they felt like that opinion was correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| that we could not enforce that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| So we approached the developer with a partnership idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| that this would be something that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| would administer the project, coordinating the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| do the design work so that they were just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| essentially a financial partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| When we got to the point that we developed a cost estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| they decided that that was beyond the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| of what they wanted to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| And at that point, we now, because obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| we want to make sure that our partner at the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| is taken care of, that we don't create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| unsafe traffic conditions on any county road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| or town road in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| So this contract will allow us to design the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| and then we'll come back to this body for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| I think there's a couple of small right-of-way acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| and a construction funding that we have in a budget now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| that we designated some money a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| for realignment of Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| And with the advanced NOx process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| we kind of paused that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| So we won't be asking this body for any appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| but it is an unfortunate situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| that there was a flaw in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| and I'm working with Mr. Moyers there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| to bring to this board in March of next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| an ordinance, I think it's an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| that would codify this situation so that it doesn't happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| so that my department can enforce these conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| whether it's in town or on a state highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Unfortunate condition, but one that I think we've got a plan to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| and a plan to ensure it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| Thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| That was part two of my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| what are we doing to directify this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| and make sure that it doesn't happen in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| and you've already taken care of that, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| How much is this going to cost the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| because the two developers backed out of the agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| I would estimate it, I think this contract's 30-some thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| We'll have a small right-of-way acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| construction probably in the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| I would say it'll be less than $600,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| probably between $500,000 and $600,000 would be the total project cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Taxpayers shouldn't be paying $600,000, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| I didn't bring it because I didn't know it was going to be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| They were not supposed to start any lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| until this road improvement was fixed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| I didn't go down, are they building lots now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Based on the opinion from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| we don't feel as if we have the legal authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| To stop them from building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| I'm glad you're getting this straightened out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| because this is totally wrong, what's happened to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| It is wrong on all fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| I know your department does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| I even went down there and told you we've got two Fritz roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| and I went to the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| The interstate split them up, which we need to get that changed, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| The good thing is, this is a pretty short project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| so we can have this project completed by the end of the calendar year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| so that by the time these homes that we're talking about are being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| and occupied, we'll have the problem rectified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| as far as the turn lane construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3478)|

| 1:00:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Mr. Caldwell, do you want to just give us the quick synopsis of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| since we have some junior commissioners here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| and we don't normally every month do a tax increment financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3619)|
| 1:00:31| Really simply put, a few years ago when we were getting TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| and pilot requests through the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| whether it was for downtown redevelopment or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| we thought it was best to come up with a policy that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| that we would always get a third-party review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| in order to know whether a project was worth what they were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| You actually have one on your agenda tonight for a waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| And so this is the same thing, but normally these things would start in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3670)|
| 1:01:18| So this is going straight through IDB because it's in the county, it's not in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| and we have never really formalized anything like this through IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| And so what the chamber would like to do is get permission from county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| to get a third-party review of this project and then bring that recommendation back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3696)|
| 1:01:45| Okay, and then the applicant that wants the third-party review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| pays a fee to the IDB of about $10,000, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| They pay for the third-party review, which is approximately $10,000 to $12,000, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3717)|
| 1:02:07| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Seeing none, the motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| I see that some of the people that are heavily involved with this are in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| Would any of you like to speak to this, to this request or this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3744)|
| 1:02:33| Hello, Steve Maddox, 100 Dalton Place Way, Suite 105, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| And as the applicant for the request for the TIF, I'm good with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3760)|
| 1:02:49| If we're going to need to get the report, then I would ask that we proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Any questions for Mr. Maddox or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Mr. Maddox, would you just tell the body a little bit about your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| because it is something that's really exciting for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| It's something that I say is the best kind of revenue, which is visitor revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| And maybe just give them just a little brief overview of it, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Thank you for those kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| And this is a project that actually we've been working on for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| and there's so many moving parts to a project this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| The project in Knox County is about 190 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| and it involves a total redo of an interchange and the interstate and county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| And then we're putting in over a mile of roads that's going to be dedicated to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| as well as water lines, sewer lines, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| This was actually, the idea behind this is a sports park is going to be like the theme of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| And this was a study that was spearheaded by one of our earlier commissioners, Randy Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3844)|
| 1:04:13| who got this started and got the idea rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| And the study, if you're familiar with it, says that Knox County is definitely in need of this type of facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| along with everything that goes with it, and that then not only that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| but then this location is the number one location in Knox County for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| And we had a study done by the Younger Associates, a very distinguished group that studies this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| And just to give you some quick numbers, the economic impact of this development per year is $207 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3879)|
| 1:04:49| That's wages, $141 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| Local sales tax, $853,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| Hotel taxes, restaurant taxes, all those kinds of things, $1,969,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| Indirect property tax, $1,625,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| This property right now is bringing in $7,000 a year for real estate taxes, the property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3911)|
| 1:05:19| Property taxes are going to go up to over $200,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| Once the TIF is paid for out of that portion of the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| this thing is going to still contribute about $900,000 a year to the schools and the budget and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| So I'd be glad to answer any kind of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| but I think that it's just a development that's going to be great for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| It's going to be a much more attractive entrance into Knoxville from the west and the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| as well as it's going to bring in a lot of dollars from out of the area, tourist dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| and we're going to kind of head them off before they get to Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| And it's going to bring in a lot of money to Knox County and to Farragut and for the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| And I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| I just want to mention, too, some of you were commissioners when Mr. Maddox was actually thinking about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| three or four years ago and was requesting zoning, and I got so excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| I think I reached out to several of you and said, please listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| This is something that my community needs, all of Knox County needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| It would be a regional sports complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| It will bring in all of those athletic leagues that are leaving Knox County on the weekends for travel ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3990)|
| 1:06:38| And so this is a really exciting project, especially for our youth and our athletics programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| And so thank you for your vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| I was fortunate to sit in a meeting with Commissioner Smith back here and Commissioner Thomas, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| Those two guys had the forethought, and I think we met at Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| Those two guys had the forethought to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| That was, what, four years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| Six, almost five, six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| This study was in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| It takes time for these things to happen, young commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| You want things to happen tomorrow or next week, but this is one that was a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| a great vision by Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| And with Mr. Maddox's help, it's going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| It's going to be a park, and it's going to be money coming in, tax dollars and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| Randy, we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| I don't have any questions for Mr. Maddox, and I'm happy to follow Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| in District 3 to support this project wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| We talked about this actually last month, about how we need more tax dollars in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| and not things going into the city all the time, and we kind of lose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| So being able to have the hotel, motel tax, the restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| obviously I appreciate the new look going to be coming into that Mr. Maddox and I discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| But I think this is much needed for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| I appreciate you had your vision on this, and I know it's going to be a lot of work and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| but I think it's going to be something you're going to be really proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| and I think it's a great addition for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Mr. Maddox, I'm excited about this project, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| Could you explain to the Commission about the local use that you're going to provide for the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| The sports fields, we've got three or four different management companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| that will be handling the management of the sports fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| and the idea is that they are operated and provide sports fields available to the local people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4144)|
| 1:09:15| the students and local teams and local leagues Monday through Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| Then on Friday, Saturday, Sunday is when the regional tournaments would be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| which is where then the tax dollars come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4172)|
| 1:09:42| Ms. Benitez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| This is, like, the first time I've heard about this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| but could you please explain a couple of the uses for this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| Like, is it going to be just for one sport, or how many sports would it be able to assist with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| It's designed for multiple uses for different types of fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| The fields will be all turf, and so they're designed as rectangular fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| that could be used then for soccer, rugby, lacrosse, football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| They can be turned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| You can play them across for junior sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| There's a way to angle the fields for baseball and softball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| and it's professionally designed, by the way, by a company out of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| that's done several of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| and the bleachers are set up to where they can be moved around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| and the turf is one continuous sheet of turf so that the lines on the fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| can be changed according to the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| So multiple uses, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| So to use this land, would it have to be rented out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| or could anybody come onto the area to use it when they wish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| Well, there will be management companies like soccer management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| and lacrosse team management and different ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| so it will go through them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| and so I'm pretty sure they're going to want to rent them out or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| as the teams and all develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Is there any more discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4286)|
| 1:11:36| The TIF that we're requesting is, and we're waiting for the final numbers to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| but it's going to be around $14,700,000 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| That's according to the Younger study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| The actual infrastructure that's going to be put into this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| that's going to be all public, that's going to be dedicated to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| and to the utilities is around $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| And so all the roads, the utilities, the extensions up into Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| all those improvements are dedicated to the county and to the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| Thank you, Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| We're looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| The motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4345)|

| 1:13:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Is there anybody here from the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| could give us an overview of why they want to change the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| from 19 years of age to 18 years of age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4400)|
| 1:13:29| Please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| and your position with the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| My name is John Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| I live in Knox County in the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| and I'm a member of the merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| What we're looking at is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| I'm sure all of y'all are aware of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| that they're having with recruiting and these types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| and law enforcement because of the current climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| So we're asking the merit board...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Mr. Marshall, we kind of get the microphone closer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| The merit board voted to allow the age to go from 19 to 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| to help with the recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| so that the sheriff's office can go into the high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| just like our military folks do when they're recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| And we feel that this will help solve one of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| that they have in the corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| about being able to get folks bodies that they need to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| I'm sure y'all are aware of the issues with law enforcement right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| as far as trying to get folks to come to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| and this is just one of the tools that the sheriff's department needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| in order to fill the vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Commissioner Goodmaker, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| I'll yield to Commissioner Jay and I'll finish it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| Chief Purvis, could I call on you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| As head of corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| when this came up in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Well, let me let you introduce yourself with your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| and county residence for some position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| I'm Chief William Purvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| I'm the chief of corrections at the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Thank you for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| When this came up at the merit system board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| I thought you had a good explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| as to why you all were requesting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| and how it would both allow us as an agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| to hire people for other agencies did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| but also you had a fairly good explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| of sort of what positions they would be in and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| and what they wouldn't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| So could you give us an overview as the chief of corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| as it relates to where these new recruits would be placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| You're going to get right into the mic, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| It would allow us to bring individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| into the correctional field at the age of 18 rather than 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| Usually the biggest difference between an 18-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| and a 19-year-old is the 19-year-olds already have a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| but we take these individuals directly out of the high school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| and be able to train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| We have an extensive training process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| that includes a six-week academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| and then we go into an additional on-the-job training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| we refer to as a CTO program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| which has three different tiers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| one tier where an individual is taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| and basically shown how to do the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| coached through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| allowed to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| allowed to have things demonstrated to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| and then the second phase basically they're trying to do the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| and we have an individual that is by them coaching them again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| answering any questions that they may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| and then we have a third phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| where the supervisor evaluates that employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| to ensure that they're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| Again, we know that not every 18-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| is going to be able to work in that environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| but there are many individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| who will be able to do that job and do it successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| and we want to reach out to those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| With all of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| we assign them to assignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| that we feel like that they're going to be successful in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| We evaluate them throughout the training process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| to ensure that the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| are appropriately placed within the correctional division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| We have many different jobs that are in that division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| and so part of the trainer's responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| part of the supervisor's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| is making sure that we set these people up for success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| wherever that we assign them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| That answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| Yes, and I just wanted to thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| I think it's helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| when you had a robust discussion in the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| We've talked a lot about, on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| supporting our sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| and giving them every tool that we can in the toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| to build a robust workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| and I think one of the biggest challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| are getting officers to enter our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| and our academy and our training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| before somebody else gets them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| before another agency gets a hold of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| as a possible employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| and then getting them sort of on the track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| to a successful career with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| and not get poached right off the bat on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| And we need bodies, and we need people to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| and so I'm a big supporter of this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| to move the age requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| and if for no other reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| that if we can ask an 18-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| to put on the uniform of our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| and go serve our country in every capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| from the front lines to military police to intelligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| and support our country in uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| then we certainly can recruit them to put on the uniform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| and support our sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| I think we ought to recruit as many as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| to become the next great officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| and give the sheriff's office the tools necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| to build the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| Commissioner Oster, are you just going to go last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| because we have several lights on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Everything that Commissioner Jay says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I support it totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| And the thing about one of the main reasons I'll support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| is a young lady or a young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| that when they're going to go through school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| you'll ask them what they want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| And if one of them says, I want to be a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| when they get to high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| they're still wanting to be a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Why should we make them wait another year or two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| to have to sign up to be a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| when they know that that's what they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| They want to be a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Out of 100, can we get 10 or 20 of them that'll stay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| I hope the percentage is higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| But that'll be 10 or 20 that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| And that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| So I support this, like Commissioner Jay said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| and most of all, that my little nephew knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| that he was going to be a boomer on a KC-135| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| when he was four years old in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| He said, I'm going to be flying in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Guess what he's doing today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| He's a boomer in a KC-135.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| Same thing with the police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| So I support it wholly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| And thank you, Chief, for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Mr. Shelton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| So I have a few questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| So I imagine that a high school diploma will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| Just to be the devil's advocate, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| about all I'm good for, is so when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| it comes to the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| I believe in quality over quantity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| And I think that if a student or a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| knows that they want to be a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| I feel like making them wait only solidifies that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| so that, therefore, they will feel more of a sense of duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| to perform those actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| But if we recruit them like we do the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| the military, I feel a lot of people see as an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| And I don't want the police department or the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| office to seem like an out for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| that don't have anything else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| I know that's not what the military is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| But I know that's what a lot of people see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| And I don't want something that protects our inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| and protects our citizens to be seen in that sort of light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4934)|
| 1:22:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Ms. Farrar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| And thank you, Mr. Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Thank you, Chief, for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| I really have, I'm putting my HR hat on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Is there anyone here from the merit staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| or from the sheriff's office HR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| Is there anyone from the medical staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| that does the psyche vows present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| I'm also affiliated with the human resources portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| I could probably answer any question that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| So how many applicants have we had since changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| the age from 21 to 19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| We've had, I don't know the exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| but I would say somewhere in the area of about 20 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| that are over 19-year-olds that have went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| the screening process and been able to enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| into the hiring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| So out of the 20, you're saying that all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| have passed the background and the psyche vow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| No, not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| Do you know how many did not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| I would say that it's probably consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| with the demographic of other age groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| You know, I don't have an exact number for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| but there was nothing that raised up any type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| of alarm to a disparity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| I would kind of like to hear from the medical department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| who actually does the psyche vows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I mean, no disrespect, but I would like to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| a little bit from them as far as what they're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| How many of those that passed the psyche vow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Well, first, what is the cost for a psyche vow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| and the background check and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| that goes into that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Do we have a cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| The cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| The cost, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Oh, I'm not exactly sure what the cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| And then do you know how many are still employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| The 19-year-olds that we've hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I believe that most of them are still employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| I only know of one that went on to another career field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| but the ones that we have hired have been extremely successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| In talking with the training staff and supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| they've been very, very pleased with those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| In fact, they have rated them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| as some of our highest-performing correctional officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I know that there's a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| but after discussion I will be making a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| because I would like to actually hear from someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| with the merit staff and also possibly the physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| who's doing the psyche vows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| and then someone from HR if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Mr. Patel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| I would just like to reiterate what Mr. Shelton said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| about quality over quantity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| and I would like to point out the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| that when you're taking an 18-year-old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| you're plucking someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| that has pretty much been a teenager their whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| You're plugging them straight out of high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| whereas when you're waiting until 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| you're giving them at least a year of adulthood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| or a year of kind of a little bit more maturity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| even if it's not much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| and that I feel is very important in a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| like a corrections officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| because it entails lots of power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| lots of, yeah, lots of power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| lots of repercussions over what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Ms. Muse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| On the other hand of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| I think plucking them at 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| you could guide them into the right field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| Between that 18- and 19-year-old age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| if they're bouncing around jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| it could move them to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| that they shouldn't really be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| and cause bad decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| and then end up on the other side of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| instead of the good side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| Ms. Sanchez-Benitez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| I just kind of want to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| onto what Mr. Shelton and Mr. Patel said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| about the quality over quantity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| and also add that these are 18-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| who are wanting to go into an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| that they're working with felons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| I imagine there's going to be a lot of new images| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| that they're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| and build a bit of trauma onto these young minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| that still haven't completely formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| on what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| in the coming years of their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| So I want to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| if you do go down to 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| do you have any resources for these students to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| or children or adults, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| to have in case they do get traumatized in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5236)|
| 1:27:25| or to have in case they do want to go back to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| And if they do want to go back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| will you guys offer flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| for them to split their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| between do I want to stay at this place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| or do I want to continue school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| Many of our employees do seek education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| in their part or in the off-duty time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| We do try to adjust their schedules accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| so that they can attend those classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| I would like to say one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| to the comments that were being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| In the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Tennessee Corrections Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| which is a governing body of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| they allow for 18-year-olds to be hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| As Commissioner Jay was pointing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| other agencies are already hiring 18-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| with great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Knox County, we're not able to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| to those 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| So for an 18-year-old who does want to work in corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| wants to work in law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| they have to go to another agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| So we're prohibiting 18-year-olds in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| from being able to seek out corrections as a profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| In other communities, they can go there and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| We are TCI accredited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| ACA, the American Correctional Association accredited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| PREA accredited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| and all these governing bodies that inspect us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| they all allow 18-year-olds to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| So we're not doing something completely new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| Other agencies are already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| We're just, in Knox County, we're not allowing it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| Thank you. Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| I wholeheartedly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| I believe that if our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| I mean, they can go serve our country on the front line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| And I support this because we're going to lose some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| that if they don't get maybe in this career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| by the time they're 19, they're doing on another path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| I will say that I've been out to the detention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| in the last few days, which I'm out there quite frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| and I asked several supervisors randomly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| what they thought about the 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| All of them were in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| They are supervised, so they're not by their self,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| so they would have support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| but they're not like 18-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| in the middle of a bunch of felons by their self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| They are totally supervised, and I totally support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Ms. Schoonover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| I think I just wanted to circle back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| and kind of second what Commissioner Frazier was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| So we talked about the sort of CTO program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| they have to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| serve with their coached and supervised on-the-job time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| You talked about how some of those 18-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| and 19-year-olds are your most high-performing officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| or corrections officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| How do you assess that exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| Like, how are those on-the-job sort of training opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| assessed by your supervisors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| First, they begin their sheriff's officer career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| by going through a correctional academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| It's a six-week training academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| And during that time, they go through extensive training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| in all the areas that they're going to expect to be fluent in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| They're going to go through legal issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| interpersonal communications, crisis intervention training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| defensive tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| They'll go through learning how to manage, supervise inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| And they'll go through a lot of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| associated with the different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| that they're going to be challenged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| while working as a corrections officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| And after they complete that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| which has a series of tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| they have weekly exams as a part of that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| And then they have practical exams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| where it's going to be hands-on training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| They'll be going through scenarios, role-playing situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| And once they complete that six-week training process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| they're handed over to the CTO program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| where they're going to be trained by individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| who are specifically trained to train new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| And during that time, they're evaluating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| And the thing that's stressed throughout that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| is not only do we need to be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| with that individual's capability of doing the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| the individual that's going to be doing the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| they have to be comfortable also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| So at any point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| that individual who's in the CTO process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| if they feel like, hey, I need additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| in this particular area, they can address that with a CTO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| and they can extend that phase of the training out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| until that individual feels comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| with their ability to perform the job by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| During the first year of employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| each sheriff's office employee goes through a six-month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| a nine-month, and an annual evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| During that, the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| is the one that established our evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| It goes through, and it is graded numerically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| I have a score from one to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| Each supervisor has the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| of evaluating that employee set by the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| that the merit system set for grading those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| In the front of that form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| it also has a pass or fail portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| and they make that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| along with that numerical score that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| And is that criteria accessible to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| Yes, it's part of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| I think you can get that from their manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| I'm sure this is a function of my philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| of government and of many things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| but here's why I'm supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| I believe that this recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| has been made by the proper body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| This is the recommendation of both the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| as well as the merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| and while I know as a function of ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| it has to come to us because it involves rule change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| for a body that this body created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| I think that body was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| to make these types of rules and decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| And so we will do our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| to vote up or down this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| but I would urge my colleagues to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| as a recommendation from the proper body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| and not weigh in too heavily on the merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| no pun intended, of the rule change itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| Thank you. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Thank you. I see that we have our sheriff here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| and if you wouldn't mind, Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| this is your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| and you are the ones that will be indirectly supervising them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| I'd like to hear from you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| Obviously I think everything that's been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| as far as from the chief and from the merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| that's one of the things that we came to the merit council with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| was asking them for that assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| to allow us to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| We've heard from some of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| the same things that we've heard from some of you all here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| on county commission today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| and some of our, I'm not sure how to address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| I guess there are assistants here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| and you're all's assistants, and I'm glad that they're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| and seeing how things really operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| But as myself, and I think Commissioner Jay mentioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| I went into the military myself at the age of 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| I was handed a weapon during basic training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| but guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Somebody was there beside me to help me and train me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| and teach me everything that I needed to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| So when I came out of the military, I was 20 years of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| and as soon as I turned 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| I came to work here at the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| so for the next 30 years, that was my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| But I had somebody with me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| If we cannot get into our schools and be able to recruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| just like we recruit anywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| we want to be able to establish these young people to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| look, there is a place for you in the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| We're going to train you, we're going to teach you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| we're going to make sure that you're safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| and the thing about it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| here's something that hasn't been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| this is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| It's a safety issue not only for the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| within our corrections facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| it's a safety issue for those officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| within our corrections division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| because we are that short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| And it's my responsibility to make sure that we find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| every way that I can, and with the help of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| of this Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| help me make those decisions to get the right people in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| There's 25-year-olds who don't make the right decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| there's 30-year-olds who do not make the right decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| there's 18-year-olds who do not make the right decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| and that is up to us to be able to find those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| that are not able and capable to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| It's not for everyone, we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| If this job was easy, everybody would want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| at least not for the pay anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| But everybody wants to be a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| a lot of people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| But it's hard, and I tell the recruits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| that come through the law enforcement side of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| if this job was easy, everybody would want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| One percent of our population is in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| One percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| That tells you how tough this job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| So I went to our merit counsel and I asked them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| please, drop this, let us get in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| let us find other ways to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| If it doesn't work, put the blame on the Sheriff Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| But I have no reason to doubt that it will not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| To our junior commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| I'm just going to call on the two that have not had a chance to speak yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| and I'm also going to allow Commissioner Oster to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| So Mr. Coffey and then Ms. Farrar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| and then Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| I would just like to say I support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| but just out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| a typical 19-year-old is in college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| and a college class schedule is a lot more flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| than what it's like in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| So what would the typical training be for a high schooler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| working around the high school schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Because it would be a lot easier for a college student to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| than a high school student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| The 18-year-olds that would be going through our training process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| is a Monday through Friday training process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| and they actually would be there usually from 8 to 1630| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| is usually the training hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| So if they had classes in the evening, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| But that would be one of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| where we would have to have the individual from that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5963)|
| 1:39:32| Mr. Coffey, does that conclude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Ms. Farrar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| What is the average age of other cities and counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| around Tennessee for officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| The average age of officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Well, the average minimum requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| The average minimum requirement across the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| most of the other agencies do start hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| For the patrol division, they are able to hire at the age of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| We are not in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Right now we can only hire 19-year-olds and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| I liked what Commissioner Buehler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| I definitely agree with his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| Jay also made a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Let me just speak from a little bit of experience if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| When I was in Afghanistan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| I was a military intelligence guy that did counterintel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| One day I was doing counterintel on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| There was an Army unit that was coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| and we were going door-to-door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| against what we called hard Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| The corporal, who is the team leader in this case, is 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| and then the three guys with him are all 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| If anybody knows me, I'm big on freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| That's what American stands for, I think, in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| These 18-year-olds and these 19-year-olds are going door-to-door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| putting their life on the line for your freedom and my freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| so that we can make the choices that we think are best for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| Now, a lot of you also know I have a brand-new son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| Would I want my son necessarily to do this? Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| Would I want to do it? Probably not, but that's not for me to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| It's for that 18-year-old to decide or that 19-year-old to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| what's best for their life, what's best for their career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| If my son grew up his whole entire life being like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| I want to be a police officer, I want to be a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| and you wore it as his costume for every, you know, trick-or-treating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| and he did the programs in the high school in ROTC growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| and that's what he wanted to do, then I would support him in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| But that's his choice, not mine at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| even if I want it or don't want it for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| You know, this is not an easy decision necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| as like a parent looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| but for somebody that stands for freedom and freedom of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| and to be able to do what you want to do with your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| as long as you don't hurt anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| I think we should let the 18-year-olds decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| You know, in this country, that's when you're an adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| I think you should be an adult at 26, but that's just my personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| but that's when your brain stops forming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| But we look at them as adults, and as an adult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| you should be able to pick your career path and what you should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| If you want to go fight for your country and die for your country, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| If you want to be a police officer and serve your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| you should be allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| So just from personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| I've had to watch some of these young kids die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| which is a terrible thing, and I don't wish it upon anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| I don't want to see anybody go to war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| It's probably one of the worst things you can experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| but it was their choice to go and die for your freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| and put their lives out there for this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| so that they can make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| and so that other people can make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| on how they want to live their lives as Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| So I'll be supporting this for that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| I may be the commissioner on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| who has a little bit different take on the 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| I sat on the Merit Council when Chair Spangler came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| and asked us to, at that time, reduce it to age 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| I was not comfortable then at 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| and to be honest with you, I had some heartburn at 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| So what I've done for the last couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| is I've really delved in with a lot of homework, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| and wanted to be really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| up front of where my opinion is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| I get that 18-year-olds can go to the military, which I respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6252)|
| 1:44:19| My issue with an 18-year-old in the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| because that's where they're going to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| is a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| It's a concern to me because we're short-staffed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| It's a little bit different because I have family in military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| I understand the hierarchy, and I understand how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| And if we're sticking an 18-year-old in a pod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| with 30-, 40-, 50-year-old criminals who are pretty savvy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| I mean, are going to say things to these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| that they're going to believe, that's a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| Being short-staffed is a concern to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| and our correction officers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| Now they've got additional concern to their safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| along with the prisoners and now along with an 18-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| Maybe I'm doing too much research into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| but if I'm going to make a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| my constituents are going to know why I'm going this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| As of right now, Nashville, which is Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| Memphis, which is Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| and the city, which is Washington County, are all 21-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| The smaller counties that are 18-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| are Blount, Sevier, Loudon, Jefferson, and Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| So our larger counties, like Knox County, are all 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| I reached out to a psychologist to get his take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| His take was, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| September 2021 should be about standard for corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| That's his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| But to me, I felt like that was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Raising three sons, I can tell you, for personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| their frontal lobes do not develop before they're 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| 19- and 20-year-old applicants have applied since September 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6375)|
| 1:46:23| Seven have failed the psychological.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| So if you are doing psychological testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| which is a two-part test, it costs $265 to do the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| I know that's not a lot of money, but Commissioner Frazier asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| and I wanted to be able to give that to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| If you can't get a good portion of 19- and 20-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| to pass the psychological,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| I go back to my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| how's an 18-year-old going to pass the psychological?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| There's not a lot of difference in those ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| besides maybe the 19-year-old has been out in the workforce for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| maybe the 19-year-old's been in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| But maturity level is just, in my opinion, not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| For that, I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| I appreciate all my other commissioners and their opinions about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| and their thoughts about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| I would like to ask Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| if we do have an 18-year-old in the pod and we are short-staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6454)|
| 1:47:41| does that 18-year-old have that ability to have that support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| by a seasoned officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| But let me correct you on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| Shelby County's already dropped their age to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| I just talked to Sheriff Bonner from Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| Did they just do that this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| They've just done it recently, as he told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| so I just wanted to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Because as of Friday last week, they were still accepting only 21-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| So that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| Like I say, I may be the lone voice up here, and that's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| but I feel like it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| We talk about having quantity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| but there's a big difference between having 18-year-olds working at a Chick-fil-A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| and quantity as we are talking about quantity with prisoners who are dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| and we have got dangerous criminals in the pods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| So to me, the quality obviously is a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| Three years ago, I really wanted to push having our cadet program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| back in the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| We've got that in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| I think it is a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| It gives the kids the ability to be in there learning in a different capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| and kind of shows them how it works and if they want to continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6548)|
| 1:49:16| So I would love to see that program start up in the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| I also don't want anybody to think in the Sheriff's Office or Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| that I don't support the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| They're probably not anybody that's supporting that more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| but it is a concern to me, and as a commissioner in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| that's just a concern, and I'm just being honest about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| So that's where I'm at, and thank you for your time standing down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| and giving us your opinion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Again, I just go back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| I absolutely mean no disrespect for asking for the support of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| I just feel like, out of fairness, I would like to see someone from the merit staff here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| and possibly someone from the medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| To Commissioner Beeler's point, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| We do need to listen to the committees and boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| I just would have hoped that many of my answers or any of my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| could have been answered by those that are here representing the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| So in saying that, I would like to make a substitute motion to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| Substitute motion is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| Seeing none, all those in favor of the substitute motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| We're going to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| Commissioner Lundy is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6677)|

| 1:51:27| I'm going to pass right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| Commissioner Ward passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| Because this is a work session and the formal meeting is next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| I'm going to go ahead and vote aye to give my colleague some extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Commissioner Hill votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6708)|

| 1:56:10| Mr. Caldwell, you had provided us the executive summary from UNICAP on Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6970)|
| 1:56:20| How many total years, because this goes to 2037, but construction completes in 2025,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6980)|
| 1:56:30| so is this a 12-year, or is this a 14-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| So I think it's a 12-year pilot, and it says in there, I'm pulling it now, I think it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=6995)|
| 1:56:42| in there, it's got a, is it a two-year construction period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7002)|
| 1:56:48| So they have that construction period, and the pilot kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| Okay, but I couldn't really find where it said 12 years, so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| I think it's on the very last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Any other details you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7022)|

| 1:57:07| I would say this, this is, the Dominion Group's done work around here, and this is the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| time they've actually asked for any type of incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7036)|

| 1:57:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7040)|

| 1:57:27| so to activate that would be really good for our waterfront with a restaurant down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7047)|
| 1:57:34| there and shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7054)|

| 1:57:40| And the reason I moved it forward, no recommendation, is so Commissioner Lundy, who's also sponsoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| this, would have an opportunity to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| Director Caldwell, if you don't mind, could you give an incredibly brief explanation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| a pilot for our junior commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| So a pilot is a payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| It's basically a form of a tax abatement, and these are normally given if recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7085)|
| 1:58:13| for public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| And so in this case, the developer is putting in, as Commissioner Schoonmaker mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7095)|
| 1:58:22| a parking garage, so a parking garage is a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| And so that will be with the housing there, but could be used as well for the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| And there's also an extension of the riverfront greenway, and so that's a public benefit as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7112)|
| 1:58:41| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| So those things are what is normally included for TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7122)|

| 1:59:41| ran with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7181)|

| 2:13:16| some tweaks that are, it's a red line copy. What is the best way to present those to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=7996)|

| 2:13:31| to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8011)|

| 2:13:33| Could you provide me with that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| The date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| That he sent it. Was it Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| I don't have the date. I can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8021)|
| 2:13:52| So, Commissioners, we received an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8032)|
| 2:13:59| Oh, goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| Actually, Friday the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| And it is the red line copy, the suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| So, if you can pull that up or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8050)|
| 2:14:16| Drusilla, do you have the copy of the email, by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8056)|
| 2:14:25| That we could pull up. I know it's not incredibly easy to see, but worth trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8065)|
| 2:14:46| And the amendment is just to clarify the language for uses permitted by right and then those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8086)|
| 2:14:54| uses on review. And the suggested changes in the red line copy, just further clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| those. Really, it's more for protection of residential property owners adjacent to properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8102)|
| 2:15:11| who are considering a general business or business and manufacturing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8111)|
| 2:15:30| And this was really brought to the attention of Planning Commission and also the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| staff because the current zones allow for drive-thrus without any sort of design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8134)|
| 2:15:40| meaning you could have a drive-thru next to your property with no landscape, lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8140)|
| 2:15:48| or noise standards. And we didn't think that was very fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| Okay. Does everybody have it? Or have been able to see it? It was Friday. It was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8154)|
| 2:16:08| 10th, February 10th. Drusilla just sent it, re-sent it to us, just now. Do you think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| could pull it up on the... Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| And I appreciate everyone pulling it up and for your consideration on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8180)|
| 2:16:38| Commissioner Frazier, since this is a no recommendation and we will be discussing it again next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| this will allow us time to, a week to review and potentially ask questions of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| and so on and so forth. That would be great. I would appreciate it. Thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| Daly. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Snowden? I guess Amy's gone. Is Amy here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8218)|
| 2:17:09| Are you familiar with this ordinance? Why did it start? What is it all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| Yeah, it originated kind of in reference to the Alcoa Highway. We've got a lot of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8235)|
| 2:17:24| out there that are city and county and the standards were out of line for the similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8244)|
| 2:17:33| commercial zones, so we decided to move forward to try to make our commercial zones and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8253)|
| 2:17:39| city zones a little more streamlined. And to Commissioner Frazier's point, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8259)|
| 2:17:46| CA zone right now, used by rights of restaurant, and it doesn't specify whether or not it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8266)|
| 2:17:52| a drive-through. So, you know, there are probably some instances where, and I think this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| codifies those, where there is more protection for those. Whereas right now, you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| a use by right and there is no, maybe, additional level of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8282)|
| 2:18:09| Yeah, I just want to make sure that the Alcoa Highway stretch is not over-regulated because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| we can't get businesses there now, you know, because of the way the highways are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| I don't believe it would be. The way the ordinance is drafted, it talks about the standards as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| they relate to the classification of the roadway. So, if it's obviously an arterial roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| the standards are going to be less than a local street. And I don't know if I've seen the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| redline edits. Maybe Amy has, but I'd just like to get a copy of those if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8320)|
