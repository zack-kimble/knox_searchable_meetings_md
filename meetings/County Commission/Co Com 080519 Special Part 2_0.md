| 0:00:00| When you look at the money that excludes the schools and the detention center and the jails and so forth, there's $77,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| I mean, the schools have a retreat every year in Townsend, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7)|
| 0:00:13| And so under this interpretation, that would not be proper either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=13)|
| 0:00:17| I'm just saying that obviously the policy needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=17)|
| 0:00:21| It's just my thinking and my understanding when you have a food budget, as long as the people are doing it appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=21)|
| 0:00:26| That's the end of my questioning, but I know that some of the mayor's people and, Dwight Vandivate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=26)|
| 0:00:31| I know that you're chomping at the bit to get involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| So perhaps I've got some questions I'd like to ask him at the appropriate time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| Richard, this food budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| This food budget, the way I voted on it and my intention was these departments have a food budget for county functionings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=43)|
| 0:00:52| just like open senior centers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| Would that not be the way you interpret that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=55)|
| 0:00:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| That's the way I interpret it for parks and rec when they have ribbon cuttings and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| And even the citizens are invited to these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| Now, even these functions that we have here in county government in that small assembly room, the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=66)|
| 0:01:13| I see a lot of citizens come in there and eat too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| That's what this food budget is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| But here's what I'm interested in, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| Even if we throw the food budget out, you said there's been a lot of mischarges that were uncalled for that were not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| Yes, sir, improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| Improper, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| When the purchasing card program was initially established, travel, entertainment, lodging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| and meal purchases were not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Since that time, certain employees have been granted permission to use the purchasing card for these transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| Who were these people and what department were they in, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Okay, those are the 80 people we were talking about where the restrictions were lifted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| which would include the ones in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| What department were they in, more or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Whose umbrella were they in under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Under the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Under the mayor's office, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Now, do you know, Commissioner Hammond talked to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| do you know of any other department that used a P card to go out and pay for food at a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=128)|
| 0:02:17| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| You ran an audit here of 217, checked 217 transactions of every cardholder, not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=138)|
| 0:02:27| Seven hundred and ninety-some of them showed up in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| and 396 still have missing receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| But what we're trying, what I'm trying to find out, Richard, is who authorized this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| and give these people the authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| That would have to be determined by questioning people in the purchasing or finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=161)|
| 0:02:48| Hugh, who authorized these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Why don't you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Let me, I'm going to go ahead and let Hugh to answer that and then Commissioner Moore, I want you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=173)|
| 0:03:05| you can follow up with Hugh, always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| Do you swear or affirm that through your testimony here today you're going to tell the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| and nothing but the truth so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| John Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| John Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| In your opinion, you're the person, did John Warner have the authority to do that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| I was told he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Who told you that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| Mr. Warner himself, who I reported to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| And I believe he discussed it with Mr. Troyer, who was a comptroller at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| Mr. Troyer, in other words, said that he had, Mr. Troyer was a comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| He was in under John, wasn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| John and I both reported to Mr. Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| I can't believe that you and John either one had the authority or Warner either one had the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| Where does that come in under the authority of the finance director to lift these sanctions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| This is in effect to protect the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| I was told it was part of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Mr. Troyer may be able to speak to that in regard to the mayor being the chief fiscal officer for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| That wouldn't be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Would you like to answer that, Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| From what I understand, I think Mr. Wallace made a good point that this is just a method of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| And start right there, that this is just a method of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| And Mr. Warner did, the way I understand it, the way I understand it, that Mr. Warner opened it up for travel and for local meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=284)|
| 0:04:54| The first office that it was opened up for was the county commission at their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| They didn't want to have 19 different credit cards and they wanted to do those travel through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=298)|
| 0:05:07| And then Mr. Warner opened it up for others subsequent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| But we just have one P card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| That's where they get hotel reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Let me ask you one thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| On all of these P cards and everything, you say that the food, it was to buy food with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| What did we budget the mayor's department for food in 06-07?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=331)|
| 0:05:40| I don't have the budget in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| I'm sure it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I think it's part of our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| So I'm sure it's in Mr. Wall's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Mr. Walls, would you happen to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| No, sir, I don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| I was thinking I read somewhere it was just $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Does that sound correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| I believe they spent a lot more than what their budget was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| I would like to get those figures, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Mr. Troyer, I'd like to have those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| Would you get them for me if you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Yeah, I will certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| I've got in my mind that there's something wrong with the policy or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| but can you tell us exactly, like I know there's people in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| if someone makes a purchase on a P card, that it alerts somebody if it's an improper charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| Now, do you get a page or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| We have a permit notify function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| It's delivered through email notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| But as I explained to Mr. Walls in the past, it's really not an auditing tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| It will notify us in certain cases of unusual purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| Say, for example, the sheriff's department buys horse feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| Well, co-op is flagged as an unusual category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| And those, as I said earlier, those flags are based on what level a merchant is willing to report at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=432)|
| 0:07:23| And certain merchants will report at tier one, other merchants at tier three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| But from time to time, we do get those notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| Now, moving forward in July, we're going to have a new, we've got an RFP out on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| and we'll be making an award to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| And I stopped you right there because moving forward, that's a difference in what we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=461)|
| 0:07:50| Now, this is what was told to me at some point in time by I don't know who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| But when they first got the P cards, the mayor and him were in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| and he tried to pay at some restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| The card would not go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| So as soon as they got back here, someone told somebody to unlock that card where they can buy food or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=485)|
| 0:08:13| Now, is that an accurate statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| I can't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| I recollect the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| But I do know that restrictions were lifted from the majority of the cards that were held in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=503)|
| 0:08:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Does someone in, say, engineering that drives a dump truck, operates a backhoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| or whatever they do over there, build roads, they can walk into Harvey's or Hardy's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| and if they take this P card, they can buy food with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| No, they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| So is there a difference between, are there two standards in Knox County, one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| Certain cards are restricted at certain levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| It depends on the department head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| So there's only a few cards that are lifted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Probably seven or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| Right now, Matt Moonfield, how many do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Seven or eight right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| But in the past, Richard said there were some 80 that had that restriction lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| And most of those were a matter of efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| As with the county commission, you had 19 people booking hotels, airlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| and it would be hard to manage 19 different people, especially when you've got a staff of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=567)|
| 0:09:38| Is it appropriate to make a motion at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| I would like to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| because I know that we can have a discussion about what's proper and what's improper as far as charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| But certainly, I think there's one thing we can all agree on is at least, by golly, bring back a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| I mean, I don't know anybody else in county government, an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| who would have got reimbursed if they just come back and said, oh, here's a $200 charge on my credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| I don't have no documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| So if we leave all the other stuff out and we can take care of it during budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| but for at least the people who had these credit cards using taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| surely they could at least brought a receipt back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I mean, if we're buying you a $200 meal, surely you could bring a piece of paper back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| So I'm going to make a motion that anything that does not have a receipt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| that they reimburse Knox County by Friday or direct the law director to file suit to collect these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=641)|
| 0:10:50| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| I would just like to ask Commissioner Moore if he would accept a friendly amendment that not only missing receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| but also personal items and alcohol purchases, that there should also be reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Commissioner Moore, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Are there any other questions for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Yes, I have some more questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| What I'm talking about for his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| I've got a question, Mr. Chairman, about the motion at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=684)|
| 0:11:32| Mr. Law Director, is Friday, this Friday, giving them the time to accomplish that, these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=692)|
| 0:11:45| or should we give them an extra, I'm thinking along the lines of ten days to two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=705)|
| 0:11:55| instead of just four, since they can't go to the bank today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=715)|
| 0:12:06| But, you know, maybe next Friday, if you'd give them until whatever next Friday is, if you think that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=726)|
| 0:12:17| I'd be willing to amend my thing to give them to Friday week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Who's seconded that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Will you accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Can I add a friendly amendment to this, too, also, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Will you accept that second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| I'll accept that second, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| But I'm concerned about these Club LaConte memberships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| They should be put in there like the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Mr. Pinkston, and I have concerns about that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| but I think that's just the first motion that may be made because I've got another motion I'm going to make here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=767)|
| 0:12:56| when we deal with this one, and it has to deal with the bogus 12 receipts that were turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| I have something to say on that, too, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Are there any questions pertaining to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Are we talking about on page 16 these receipts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| All we're dealing with right now is Commissioner Moore's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Do you have any questions on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| What exactly, Commissioner Moore, are you describing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Is it the missing receipts documentation, insufficient documentation, slash purpose on page 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=816)|
| 0:13:46| And the reason I ask that is that, obviously, Ms. Boone, that has already been taken care of, supposedly, according to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=826)|
| 0:13:56| Ms. Finch is being dealt with in the courts already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| John Warner has decided that he won't show up under any circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| I mean, which of these are we actually going to deal with in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Both E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| And, you know, if Mr. Warner doesn't repay, he can be sued and chance record along with anybody else that refuses to pay back the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=856)|
| 0:14:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Oh, your light's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| I'd like to call on the mayor and perhaps Mr. Vandivate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| This motion affects you directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I'd like to hear any response that you might have, Mr. Chairman, if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| I'll need to be sworn, Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| Do you swear through your testimony here today, swear or affirm through your testimony here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| that you'll tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Hammond, if I could speak to the motion only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| I think that's appropriate, the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| And call to your attention page two of the final report of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=906)|
| 0:15:20| And if you will note, there are three bullets at the top under the section labeled background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Bullet number two says the audit or the review examined a sample of transactions from all purchasing card holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| I forget the number, 217, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Then bullet number three says all mayor's office purchasing card transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| and expense reimbursements for the period of October 2002 through May 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| It is not clear to me upon what basis the maker of the motion draws a distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| between the mayor's office and all card holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| We don't have any particular problem being held to a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| But if there is going to be a standard, that standard needs to be a single standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| consistently applied to all employees of Knox County who have a P-card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| who had a P-card and used it during the period of October 2002 through May 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| I do not know upon which basis, upon what basis you would set a different standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| and ask one particular small group of employees to adhere to that standard when the vast majority are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| So I'd ask you to consider that as a fundamental issue of fairness and even due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| Mr. Van de Veen, and I agree with you, you don't need to be held to a higher standard than any other employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| And I heard Commissioner Moore say all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| And I would assume that the maker of the motion meant all employees that have not turned in receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| Commissioner Moore, would that not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| We don't want to hold the mayor's accountable more than any other employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| But certainly we want to hold you to the same standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And I think any other employee, when I spent 14 years in the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| and went across the country picking up prisoners, when I came back, if our stuff wasn't right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Kathy Hamilton sent it back downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| If we didn't have a receipt with a zero balance, it didn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| And, Dwight, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| So at least when the taxpayers are paying for something, at least you could bring back the receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| I don't think that's holding you to any standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| But I think all Knox County employees who have a purchase card that have not turned receipts in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| I'm sure that all of them, if they hadn't, never got reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| But if they haven't, then they need to be held accountable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| So all people who have a purchasing card that have failed to turn in a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:58| Richard, do you know of any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| I believe there's two listed in your thing of the whole audit of the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| There was only two that didn't have receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| When we paid seven of the 217 items selected, we only had two instances of missing receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| Well, I think then whoever that is should be held accountable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| But that's not the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| That's just of the random sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Is that right, Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| That's not all the receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| But we would have to have a full-blown audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| And we can only ask to collect those that we know of and to continue to search for any other missing receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:44| And as we find them, we need to collect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Are we actively trying to seek out all receipts of all purchase cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| Is there a charge given to Mr. Wallace or someone else to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| Well, we can direct him if we so wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| But all we can do at this point is to do what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| I mean, try to collect for what we know and then proceed from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| I'll be happy to, Mr. Chairman, if the mayor is in front of us and it's proper to allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| We'll gladly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| We'll go back and look at every purchase for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Now, remember this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| This is five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| So if we can't find a receipt for some reason, whether it's someone who has lost it or has never given in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| there's some documentation, they'll be required to repay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Now, also remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| We live in an era where we book things online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| A great example is the National Association of Counties meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| So if there's not the original receipt in the commission file for that, even though it was documented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| it's got to be the National Association of Counties, will commissioners be going back to pay that receipt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| You need to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| So while what you're saying sounds really good, and we will certainly adhere to it, on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| I think there's some things you may want to consider as you go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| A lot of things you register online, you do not get the original receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| So that runs a risk as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| But we will do whatever you suggest in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Some of our employees are going to be coming to see you because they may have had a receipt five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| It might have got turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| We can't come up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| We've gone back and looked for five years for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| So I would hope you would consider some documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Obviously, if you're registering for a Tennessee County Services and National Association of Counties meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| it's pretty clear on the purchasing card what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| And you do make some good points, Mayor and Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| If the examples that the mayor brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| would there be other documentation that someone could show if, after this amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| they can't come up with your receipt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Because presumably they would have had to have turned that receipt in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| And normally on online registrations, that sort of thing, when I've done it in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| you're able to print out a receipt at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| Actually, most of them email you a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| So it's possible that they did get a receipt, would have been turned in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| even going back to the old procedures, would they be able to, would they have turned that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| and then now it's in the hands of, I guess, our finance department somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| Now, each department up until November retained their own receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:48| And in our review of all cardholders, we did not find a problem with missing receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| only the two of the 217 items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Well, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| We do need to go back and be thorough to make sure there are not any other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| that have abused the P cards and to collect that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1329)|
| 0:22:18| These employees here, Dwight and the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| need to be held to the same standard as every other employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| And if they've misused it, then they should pay it back just like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| And I think that's the intent of Commissioner Moore's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| at least that's the way I take it, and I think we should proceed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Commissioner Moore, you're talking about going back to 202?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I'm talking about going back to what we know of in this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| This administration, these individuals have had 11 months to come up with receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| If they were somewhere at NACO, surely you could have called NACO and got a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:12| So, I mean, Jolie, we get receipts, I guess, do we not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| if we register online for a NACO conference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Or do we bring back a receipt or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Just speaking of the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| We normally register by hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| I fax in with our credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| So I would have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| And most of the time then we'll get an e-mail confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| And, plus, when we go and we get our hotel room, we bring back receipts to get reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| We get the folio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| And then we get per diem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| We don't get what we go out there and actually charge to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| If we charge a $200 meal, we only get the $50 whatever a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| You can go and eat a $300 meal, but you're getting $54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| But, you know, and I'm not, you know, I guess we can, like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| we can take care of a lot of this stuff in the upcoming budget that maybe we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| In my mind, I never approved, but I guess it got in there somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| So I think the feeling of this commission is they weren't going to do nothing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| But, I mean, I think the receipts is something that, you know, all employees have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| And I hope this commission will stand up for the rest of the employees in Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| 1,300 that don't get to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| So how far are you wanting to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Whatever this audit says they owe in missing receipts and what is the missing receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| and the undocumented receipts and the alcoholic purchases and any personal purchases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:59| Richard, and that's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| I believe the start point was 2002 is the answer to his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| We're getting another administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Oh, I'm sorry, Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| So I want to make sure I understand you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| So we're going to go back and look at the 60,000 transactions back in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| And regardless of the situation, if there's not a quote receipt, not a confirmation, but a receipt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| we're going to ask those employees to reimburse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| Mr. Mayor, I think I'm saying that some type of receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Have you not turned in any receipts in 11 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| I've turned in a lot of receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Well, the ones that they're saying you're missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Have you turned in any documentation to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Yes, I've turned in lots of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Mr. Wallace, can you come back to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Have they turned in receipts for your missing receipts and undocumented receipts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:54| So missing receipts is they've turned in nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Now, they may have explained it, but there's still no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| They may have written it down on a piece of paper and said this is our explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| but not a receipt or not something from the vendor, whoever you charged it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| Let me just give you one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| National Association of Counties, where you register online, that is we don't have a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| It's pretty well documented what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| So we'll go back to people who have registered for conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| and if they don't have the original receipts, then I'm assuming you want me to go back and get the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| which I'm glad to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| I'm not saying original receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| I'm saying some kind of receipt, either an e-mail or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| saying that they've confirmed that they've got your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| I think the word is looking for confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| We can go back and get that if that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| It's not 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| I think we're just having a word problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| I think the words are no documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Well, we have plenty of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| But not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| The motion was made with receipts, and that's what I want to make clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| But it can't just be on a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| No, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| It's got to be something legit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| And why haven't you turned that over to Richard Wallace already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| We feel like we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Richard, come back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Let me finish answering my question, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| For example, when you turn in a purchasing card receipt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| and it says registration, National Association of Counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I don't know how far off that can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Well, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| We're viewing that as our receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| When we get it, it says registration, National Association of Counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| or registration, Tennessee County Services Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| What you're telling me, if employees don't have the actual receipt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| but they've got documentation, want me to go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Now, I'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| But remember, I'm going to be coming back after some of you as well in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Mr. Mayor, you know, we've played this game every time we've had a conversation about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| that you come back after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| But right now we're talking about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| That's what my mom and dad used to tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I said, Mom, everybody feels that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Let's just focus on you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| So what you're saying is you want me to do this for my employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| but you don't want me to do it for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| I think the wording, what he said, he wants confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| But I want to make sure it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Receipt or confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Or confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Receipt or confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| We're more than willing to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Well, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Is that the motion, though, that you made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| No, but hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| I've got to see if I want to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I've got to see if I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Mr. Walsh, come back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| What are you comfortable and what have they turned over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I mean, we've been on this audit for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| And you've given plenty of opportunities to turn over and explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| and everything about these undocumented charges or no receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| or alcoholic purchases or personal purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Are you comfortable with the audit that says that these total amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| and what is that total amount right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| The table on page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1734)|
| 0:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| The total missing receipts or documentation, the total is $29,544.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Do you feel comfortable saying that they've had plenty of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| to show you confirmation or some kind of documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| besides something written on a piece of paper saying this is what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| to hold this number at $29,544?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| That's the number I want to work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Mr. Walsh, may I ask a question, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Mr. Walsh, what about this $9,571 that's insufficient documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Those represent items that we would have had a receipt for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| but we did not feel like the business purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| or explanation were proper Knox County expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| I want to ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Did you audit every cardholder in Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| like you did the cardholders in the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| We held 217 transactions out of about 26,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| and only had two missing receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| and we did not feel like that was a problem with the other departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| and, therefore, we did not go any deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| But what I'm saying is you did not treat the mayor's office any different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| than you did any other cardholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Who said chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| You're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Would it be appropriate, we're asking people to pay back money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| that some of them believe they have turned in a slip that came off the computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| or whatever that Richard Mayer may not consider legitimate documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| Would it make sense to allow two commissioners to take a look at the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| that Richard is considering insufficient or lack of proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| and let someone look at that from the commission and verify that, yes, we agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| or, no, we think that this classifies as enough documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| Because what I don't want to do, if the county's owed money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| then I want it to be repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| But I don't want people repaying things that they believe they've turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| the proper amount of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Well, this was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| I think it was, see if I can get it right again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| that they are to repay for E&F any alcoholic purchases and any personal purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:54| And we've given them until Friday week to reimburse Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| or the law director to file suit to collect those monies for the taxpayers of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| Now, I guess, Mr. Law Director, with them between now and Friday week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| if they were to come to you and say, here's a receipt, I guess you could minus it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| I guess, if it's a legitimate charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| But not to go on for months and months again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| We've got to bring this thing to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| We've got a budget to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| I think you just changed the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| What I understood from your motion, it was that insufficient documentation or purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| that's item E, and missing receipts, documentation, that's item F, are to be collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:41| They're to be collected from the individuals in this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| And failure of those persons to come forward with the monies in those columns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| it would be $4,832 for Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| It would be $4,642 for Lloyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| $941 for Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| $777 for Vandivate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| $3,292 for Werner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| $13,088 for Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Requeta Bone, she's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Her issues have been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| That was a negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| That was a negotiated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| We gained information from Requeta Bone and we resolved the matters with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| So with respect to those one, two, three, four, five, six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| we already have an action pending regarding Ms. Finch and some of her monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:52| and we have five others, which I'll talk with Mr. Walls about this to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2032)|
| 0:34:02| In addition to that, if there were alcohol purchases or other personal purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| we would collect those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| But I don't know if there are others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Do you, Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| They would be contained within items E and F, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Now, some of the alcohol may be under the hospitality account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| and some of it may actually be over in the undocumented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| or insufficient documentation purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| So that would still be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Right, that's E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| So you're looking over at D for the $1,040 on Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| and the $44 on Werner for reimbursement by hospitality account, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| We'll have to talk further about that reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| We can actually detail those items for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| But this motion involves what I just discussed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Mr. Warren, I'd call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| You can't just blurt it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| I'd have to recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I still have the floor, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| No, I didn't give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| Mr. Law Director, who will be the one that will make sure there's money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| I mean, the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Your motion did state that the documentation had to be in by Monday week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| or the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| No, that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| But I guess if they've got something that they can show the law director to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| keep him from filing suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| But that's something if they want to fight you in Chantry Court to come after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| and say we have receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| But I think my motion just needs to stay as simple as it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| And they've had 10 or 11 months to produce these, and they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| If there's other documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| it may be something that it could be worked out through a lawsuit perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| What I have, and what you have in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| is an audit that's prepared by Mr. Walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| and with the assistance of the state comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And what they have done over a period of eight months is scour these books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:16| And the administration has had eight months to provide receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| They've got thousands of dollars of missing receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| thousands of dollars of insufficient documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| It's absolutely appalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| They failed to follow policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| It's absolutely appalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| You're well within your right to seek reimbursement of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:48| You want to hear from Mr. Van de Veet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Are you talking to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| I don't need to hear from anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| You can call for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| He didn't have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Oh, I'll recognize Dwight if no one else will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| I'm going to recognize him because I want to hear what he had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| And I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| I know we've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| But if I could again just to clarify the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| and this speaks to the issue that Commissioner Pinkston raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| this audit is an audit of all mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| all mayor's office purchasing card transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| and expense reimbursements for the period October 2002 through May 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll go to page 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| and look at the section labeled All Purchasing Cardholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| it says Transactions Examined, All Cardholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| A sample of 217 items was selected from P-card activity incurred from June 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| through August 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Ladies and gentlemen, that's a sample of 217 items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| over a period of slightly more than one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| versus every single transaction out of the mayor's office for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Now, that being said, we are very comfortable with any motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| that deals with the repayment of any personal purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| because I think for those of us who are still employed with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| that really has no implication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Alcohol purchases, as we've alluded to in the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| are not a problem for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| But the representation that a random sample of 217 transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| equates to a full-blown audit, a forensic audit of five years in duration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| is simply, I think, an unfair characterization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| So again, once you set the standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| we would simply ask that that standard be equally applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| to all employees across the board for the same period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| We have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Is that correct, Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| On the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| On the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Mr. Chairman, may I speak against the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Well, then I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| You know, it takes a two-third vote if you're not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| I just have one point of clarification, and I'll be out of your way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| but that's okay if I'm out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2376)|

| 0:40:36| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2436)|

| 0:40:40| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Dwight, you brought up a good point, and I want to try to follow this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| When was the first call for an audit begun, Richard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:57| Dwight, you can stand there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| When was this first brought up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| Auditing of the mayor's transactions back to 2002 was first requested in May of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:12| The call to audit all purchasing cardholders was made sometime later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| and the reason we did the sample of 217 items out of about 26,000 to 28,000 transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:30| that was the only computerized list of transactions that was available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:39| The prior vendor, First Tennessee, was not able to supply those to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| What would you characterize the percentage of missing receipts, inadequate documentation prior to June 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:55| going backwards to 2002?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| What percentage of the transactions that you found to be lacking documentation, receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| whatever, was before the June 2006 audit time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:14| I don't recall that right offhand, but there would be some, but not a large percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| And that focused on all cardholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Okay, but I guess what I'm asking was the majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| would you characterize the majority of the missing receipts being from June 2006 forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:37| or the majority of 2006 backwards in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| No, it would be spread across the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Thanks, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Richard, on these receipts, if I went to NACO, I'm trying to see what you would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| if I went to NACO and did not have the receipt, could somebody not call NACO and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| I went such and such a date, and we're being audited down here, I need confirmation that I was there, I checked in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| can you put something on your letterhead, send back, and that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Would that satisfy you as an auditor if that came?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| We had a lot of duplicate receipts supplied to us, and that was acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| It seems like we got a little out of order here with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Richard Walls was allowed to present his case, and then we started making motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| And it seems to me that it was unfair to the mayor's side that they were never able to really rebut those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| They've rebutted specific instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| But what I would like to hear is the explanation for the accounting practices that we saw where, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| at least on the surface, it appears to be completely unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| I think those of us that have worked for the government or worked for even a small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| or a larger corporation is that the accounting that we saw here is appalling and atrocious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| And I would just like to hear some explanation on what their response is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| I mean, we've heard your side of it, and I don't think it's fair for us to pass judgment just on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| I would, you know, I'd like to hear what their side is just to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| And how do you explain some of the practices that we saw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Commissioner Briggs, if you give me just a minute, because what I'd like to do is refer you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| the appropriate section of the audit because there is responsive language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| It will be in the back section of the audit in the portion under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2693)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| Just bear with me if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:43| I think probably, Commissioner Briggs, the thing that's most responsive might be on page 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| And as is the case with the vast majority of accounting-related audit findings in this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| you will see that management concurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| What book are you in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| I'm in, Commissioner Moore, I'm in the full audit response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Your big book, you can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| You can find it in it as well on page 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| It's the same book, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Page 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| And you'll see that management has identified a number of deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| in the filing system used for PCAR transactions prior to the adoption of the new policy on November 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| This was a lack of continuity in records management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| This was largely due, frankly, to frequent staff changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| I've been with the mayor's office only four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| and in that time we have had no less than five separate custodians of these records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Each one has handled them differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| And we have suffered greatly as a consequence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| We do have somebody in place now, which I think helps going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| particularly given that we don't have any PCARs, that does a much better job of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| But during the period of time in question for the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| we had a number of custodians, five in my tenure with the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| and every time those records changed hands, there were inconsistencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| there was a lack of standardization in how they were handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| and frankly your characterization is not particularly unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| Those were not records that were maintained the way that government records need to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| And again, as you'll note throughout that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| I think off the cuff there are some 22 findings in the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| and I believe you'll see we concurred with around 18 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| There were only three or four substantive areas of disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| Just a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| I know there was a large turnover in personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| but the procedures were there as, you know, what needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| And, I mean, quite frankly, I find it unacceptable that the procedures weren't followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| I think if this would have occurred and Commissioner McKenzie could speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| I think if you saw something like this happening out at Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| somebody would lose their job over it and people wouldn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| I mean, it really, I mean, I'll be quite frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| I think it's completely unacceptable and inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| I wish I had a better response for you, Commissioner, and I don't, as we've alluded to in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| It's simply a matter of a records management system that wasn't working and wasn't properly supervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| We have had four members of our staff, including everyone from a clerical level to senior management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| depart as a consequence of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| But that doesn't change the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| The record is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| They were not maintained the way that they should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| And had they been, we probably would not be having this discussion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| I just wanted to address this question to John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and it deals with Section 303 of the charter and it's the mayor's duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| And under Section F, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| the mayor shall maintain such systems in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| applicable to government entities keeping accounting records for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| and exercising financial and budgetary control over such department, office, or agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:19| Would you say that these were generally accepted accounting principles that were being applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| Obviously not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I think you'll note that in Mr. Wall's report that management concurred, as Mr. Vannevate said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| with 18 of the 22, and we've made a number of improvements since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| And, no, at the time that was not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| I'm just going to make one final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| And it's really on the behalf of a lot of the citizens is that I know we're saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| and some of the other commissioners have said that we need to hold you to the same standard that we hold other employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| On the surface, it appears that other employees of the county are probably doing a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| And I know we could do a complete forensic audit on them and find mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| But I think we also should hold the chief executive and his staff of the county to a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| I don't think it should be the same standard that we even hold the other county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| who seem to be coming to work every day and trying to do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| And I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Mayor, if Mr. Moore's resolution passes, are you willing to pay back the questionable monies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:41| It depends on if it's applied across the board, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| I don't think I can discriminate against one group of my employees compared to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| So what we will need to do, and we will begin to do this very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| is go look back at every purchase over the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| And if it is an issue of the original receipt versus documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| and the only original receipt will do, no, I will not accept that for me or my employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| because I think you have some good people who couldn't meet up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| If documentation and it was without question could be provided, certainly I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| As it relates to the purchase of alcohol and personal expenses, we think we've already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| If we haven't, no doubt about it, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| I have a question with regard to the purchase of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| And I'm not quite sure who can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| But in this report it says, under the travel policy handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| that charges for alcoholic beverages will not be allowed in any circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| Obviously, that was violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| And I guess my question is, why were those purchases made to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| knowing that it's a clear violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Commissioner Davis, if I could refer you to page 27 of the full audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:14| And if you'll see, the second bullet on the page reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| improve control procedures to monitor the use of purchasing cards to purchase alcoholic beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| to ensure purchasing card and reimbursement policies are being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| This is an issue that we've had some fairly extensive discussions with Mr. Walls regarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| And as you'll see, management concurs in part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| There is no question that the travel policy does prohibit the purchase of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| The PCARD policy in place at this time and throughout the duration of the audit period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| is absolutely silent on the purchase of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| But if you'll see in our response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| you'll note that management notes that in previous instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| where reimbursements have been made for the purchase of alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| this was done in deference to public sentiment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| and not as a result of any prevailing policy or guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| We think that commission sentiment and public sentiment on the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| has been made relatively clear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Not everybody agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| But, again, as the audit reflects, in deference to that sentiment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| those alcohol purchases have been reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| But they are not prohibited by the PCARD guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| PCARD guidelines are silent on the purchase of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| But on some of the forms that you signed, they were blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Those charges were blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| So who lifted those charges to allow alcoholic beverages to be purchased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| I believe, actually, if you look at that form, it may say liquor stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| It does not make any reference to alcohol in a business or entertainment setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| But those restrictions would normally be waived by the chief financial officer at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| not Mr. Troyer, but his predecessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:58| So, in your opinion, you feel that liquor by the drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| and purchasing liquor in restaurants and at meals was acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| and allowable under the PCARD purchasing policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| just not under the travel allowance policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| I think it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| I mean, the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Well, let me deal with the question at two separate levels, Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| If you're asking me from a procedural standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| does a procurement card policy prohibit the purchase of alcohol in a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| or entertainment setting, the answer is very clearly no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| But as I understand it, the PCARD is just a method of payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and that's what you've admitted to before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| You said it's not a policy, it's just a method of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| So you have to defer to what Knox County policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| And is Knox County policy is that is purchasing alcohol allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| The policy is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| It doesn't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| And, again, what the point I was going to make is that at some level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| or at some point when the cards are assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| particularly they're assigned to senior management who might be in a circumstance like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| you are going to have to rely on the judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| and the experience of that particular supervisor to make a determination at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| whether or not it's an appropriate purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Let me ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| When alcohol was purchased, more than likely I'm assuming at meals, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| were county employees driving county vehicles when they were purchasing alcohol and drinking alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| Certainly not any time I've been present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| and that would be explicitly prohibited by the vehicle policy of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So at no time that when these PCARDs were used to purchase alcohol, anyone was driving a county vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| And certainly speaking for myself personally, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| I'm keenly aware of the fact that the vehicle policy of Knox County explicitly prohibits that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| That may be one of the few cases in all of Knox County's policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| where something is abundantly clear and there's no ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Well, I would just like to just one more follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| I'm sorely disappointed that you would think that you can purchase alcohol with county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| I would hope that since Knox County is a dry county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| you would know the sentiment of Knox County employees and respect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| irregardless of whether the policy was loud and clear or whether it was silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| I would hope that in a, you know, Bible belt, that we wouldn't be buying alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| That's why I insisted that it be paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Is it going to be paid back in full, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Because, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure that I understand what we're asking with regards to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| because as I understand the motion, this is not only going to affect the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| this is going to affect every employee of Knox County who has made a P-card purchase since 2002, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| I want to use some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| Registration for the annual NACO legislative conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| According to the sheet here, it doesn't say that there is any documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Obviously, it's easy to figure out if someone went to a conference or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| So if they can, what kind of documentation are we looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I mean, I've heard receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I've heard documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| I just want to try to clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| So I guess Mr. Walls or Mr. Vandivate, either one of you, both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| I think we would have to come to some sort of agreement as to what would constitute documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| But if I could speak to the NACO example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| one of the things that might prove useful is if you have a P-card transaction that says NACO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| and if you look at the calendar of that employee and it says they are at NACO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| and if you look at the NACO website and it says the 2006 NACO convention is taking place during that date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| or during those dates, from our standpoint, we would think that was sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| I don't know if Mr. Walls would feel that way or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| but that's just sort of an example that we would place on the table for everyone's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| Mr. Walls, is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| Based on the policy, there's supposed to be a receipt for anything over $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| And that's what we operated under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| You know, either there was a receipt or there was no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| And that's what's in column F if there's no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| I understand that it may say NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| It may say pilot or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| But without a receipt, you know, there's really no proof of what the transaction was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| So from the county commission standpoint, if we have faxed a sheet up to NACO to say we're going to register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| would that be counted as a receipt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Yes, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| With regards to gasoline purchases that's been made on the PCARD for county vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3534)|
| 0:59:03| so in other words, you're looking for a receipt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Plane ticket to NACO conference in Milwaukee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| There should be a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| And if they can get receipts for these, that would not be counted as far as the reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Am I hearing that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| As of now, they have not furnished receipts for the items in column F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Okay, but if they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| And I'm not asking this only on their behalf, but all these other employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| because we're going to be going back to 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Everybody who's done a purchase is going to be subject to the same standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| That's why I'm trying to define the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| In our view, there's either a receipt or there is no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| I mean, there's nothing in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Okay, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| I mean, that's how the policy reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| So, you know, if we're going to do it that way, we need to change the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| Because I've just heard discussion here about documentation versus receipt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| that's why I'm trying to get to the bottom of exactly what is going to be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| with regards to the reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| Okay, I'm not making that decision as far as what's going to be reimbursed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| What I'm telling you, the facts, as they're laid out, column F, there was no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| Mr. Hammond, I can clarify my, I'll tell you what my motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| The motion isn't for all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| If there's something that the mayor can bring up and send it to Richard Wiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| and they are in audit and we have some findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| but right now we're dealing with this audit with this money on E&F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| and alcoholic purchases and personal purchases, friendly amendment of Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| And they've had plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| This thing is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| This audit is final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| So you're not talking about all county employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Well, if they find something, yeah, if they can find something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| then they need to turn it over to Richard Wiles and let an audit happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| and bring us findings back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| We just can't have them run around and say, well, Mike Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| here's a receipt he missed in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| without someone checking it out and trying to give you the time to try to find it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| or get it if there's something missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| So if, indeed, there are missing receipts or missing things found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| the procedure would be to take them to Richard Wiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Richard would look at it and say, yes, this is something that needs to be reimbursed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| So we're going to give him the power to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Well, I think he ought to look into it and have an audit just like we've done on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Mr. Law Director, does that sound the way it should work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| I mean, what you have before you is an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| and you've got five, six, seven persons here who obviously have violated county policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| They obviously have insufficient receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| And so are we not going to go forward with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| We should go forward with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Should other county employees be looked into, bring us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| It will be up to this commission to give Mr. Wiles the direction to conduct a further audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| If you want to audit 60,000 transactions per year, have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| But what we have before us is a well-documented audit that the comptroller assisted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:22| regarding these persons and their purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| Mr. Wiles is following the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| So they've either complied with it or they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| They substantially haven't complied with the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| It's up to this body whether you wish to seek reimbursement or whether you wish to forgive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| You may want to go through it item by item and forgive some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Well, when you're talking about something that should be easy like NACO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| and a plane ticket to NACO, but who's to say that anybody ever went to NACO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| I mean, it's easy to say you're going and to buy a ticket, but were you really on the airplane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| and did you really check in at NACO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| That's what the receipt's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| You don't know if they went if they have a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| I mean, I can buy a ticket to Washington, D.C., and I can book going to NACO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| but if I didn't get on the airplane and go, I could still have a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| We'd also like to hear from Mike Arms, if we could, because he hasn't had a chance to share in the love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:31| Commission, before we swear him in, if I could just, I have not had a chance to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| and I want you to understand the scope of what it is that is under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| This is the April P-card statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| It's 58 front and back pages with $690,000 in Knox County transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| That is the month of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| The month of March had $655,000 in transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| So I do want you to understand the scope of what it is we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| But, again, I would reiterate our thought that a single standard has to be consistently applied to all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:15| for the same period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| I'm not going to sneak by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Do you swear or affirm through your testimony here today that you will tell the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Mike Arms, suite 615 in this building, Chief of Staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| I just wanted to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| I don't want anyone to think we took this audit nonchalantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| When I looked at my receipts, for example, there's two from the Sheraton Hotel in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| I personally called them and asked for copies of those receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| Both of those days were when we had Tennessee County Services Legislative Day on the Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| I mean, I can document by the calendar what I was down there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| Two Sheraton receipts and Commissioner Briggs and Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| I worked 15 years at TVA and 10 years for a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| I did a lot of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| I know that you've got to have a motel receipt to get your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| And I've never not turned in a motel receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| But we have a different level of sophistication in Knox County than you would DOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| There's more money at TVA and DOE to do tracking and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| So we send our receipts to a, I think they're kept for a couple of years in a file drawer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| Then they're put in these huge boxes and sent somewhere in the Sears building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| So, and I'll use those two Sheraton examples for 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| Sometime over the period of the last year, 24 different hands have gone through those boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| just boxes looking for receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| And I'm using that example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| I have no problem with writing that $941 check today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| I will write it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| But I just want to point out the fact that, you know, receipts in boxes are, it's not like DOE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| and TVA put receipts on optical disks and microfilm and keep them for seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| or whatever like a corporation would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| And it's not that we don't want to be that sophisticated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| It just costs money to be that sophisticated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| I guess one other point is, you know, one of my other receipts was like a parking ticket at the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| And, you know, you can look, there's documentation there where I had a plane ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| documentation where I was out of town, documentation where I was at NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| You know, that receipt is about that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| If you've ever parked at the airport, it's about that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| So that receipt is handled by several people and goes in a box and goes over to Sears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| In other words, the point I'm making is I'm prepared to write that check today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| I'd love to write it and forget about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| But when you start looking at receipts of other people, four or five years, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| they're four or five years old, and like, again, I did call the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| and they only keep receipts for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| So I tried to find every receipt of mine that was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| And a couple of those receipts were at a hotel where I checked the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| And you go in and check the Internet and you give them a card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| It was non-receipted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| I mean, I never had a chance to get a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Of course, once you don't get the receipt, you think, man, I wish I had a way to get that receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| So the point I'm trying to make is don't think that because we haven't turned in receipts, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| when this has been going on for six or seven or eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| don't think we haven't tried to look or haven't tried to find them because we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| So I'm giving that as examples of I know that if I call the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| and ask for those receipts from 2004, they're not going to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| But I'm still prepared to write that check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| just like I'm prepared to write the check when I went to a training for CTAS and I registered online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| I'm not trying to get out and write checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| I'm just telling you what you might be looking at if you start looking at all these employees going back five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:16| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Richard, when you did the samples of the P cards and other offices, was it 219?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:30| I believe it was 217.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| 217.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I know that when I took statistics at UT, they really hammered on random sample sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:44| And in your opinion, in statistical analysis, is that an acceptable random sample size to get a feel for what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4124)|
| 1:09:01| maybe actual occurrence you would find if you were to go through and audit every transaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:10| This was not a statistical sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| It was a judgmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| But to answer your question, it was a sufficient sample size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| The state comptroller's office is the one that actually took this and selected the sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| Once you get beyond 200, 300 items, your reliability does not increase that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| I can tell you're shaking your head, so you've probably had a statistics class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| And what we found out of those 217 items of all cardholders, you know, we found two missing receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:47| And we did not feel, you know, justified in expending more time and money in digging deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| And we felt like that all cardholders had actually done a pretty good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| And when we asked for these items, they handed them to us almost instantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| There was no problem finding any of these receipts that we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Yeah, you're correct from what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| I think by the time you get to about 200, 250, your statistical analysis should be pretty close to what the actual is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:30| as far as standard deviations of what you should find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| And you're not going to find a big difference as you grow the sample size larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| But I do think that the mayor has a point that if we come across other transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:51| and we see that there is something afoot, something that's not appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4251)|
| 1:11:01| then you should alert us and go in and do a more thorough audit and see what kind of results we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:13| And if we have the same situation there, then they should be held to the same standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| And I do think that if we have some type of documentation, some confirmation from, say, NACO or from Sheraton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:29| or somewhere on their letterhead that says, here is the cost and it's not necessarily a receipt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:39| but it's a documentation that, you know, we should use that as long as it was a legitimate county business expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:51| And, you know, I guess as far as the motion is concerned, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| I mean, is it part of your motion that if something is provided between now and Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:05| that either Richard or maybe the law director say, yes, I can deduct that off of this total on page 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:16| Friday of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| It's on page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| They have Friday of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| I think that's May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| That if they were to provide some type of documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| who would decide that that should be deducted off of that figure that was on page 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| Mr. Lutho, I'm trying to be as fair as I can on a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| but I think we've had eight months of this audit and we've got to deal with what's in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| If we say give the law director or Richard Wiles the authority to say we're going to accept a receipt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| or something later on, we're going to be dealing with this for another six or seven, eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| Well, I think we have a deadline and I think we're going to stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| But what I'm saying is that if they do produce some type of documentation that's acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| because if we say the law director, the law director is the one that's going to have to go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| and represent us in court to get this money if they say, hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| And he's got this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| And he's got this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| But they produce a piece of paper, some type of documentation that says this is illegitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| and he feels that's legitimate, he's going to have a hard time going into court and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| Your Honor, they still owe us this money because they were late in providing that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| Would that be a true statement, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| Partially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| You know, don't leave it up to your lawyer to sort out what is approvable and what isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:54| I mean, what you have from the audit is Mr. Wiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| and the comptroller saying missing receipts, no documentation or insufficient documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| They've already declared that you have insufficient documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| If other receipts or other documentation are provided between now and a week from Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:20| Mr. Wiles should first look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| The comptroller should look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| And they can tell me if they have taken items off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| I mean, if you think that that would be more acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| then maybe it should be turned in over to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| That's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Who should be the deciding factor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| If Richard receives something, then some type of documentation, whatever it takes to satisfy our auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:53| I think that we should accept that and deduct that off the amount because if they have done legitimate business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| for this county, then they shouldn't have to pay for it out of their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| As long as they can provide the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| And I think that's all we've ever asked for from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Well, when I look at it, I see that the administration has had eight months to provide receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| They should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| But I'm just, you know, if for some reason they can get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| and we're not giving them much time, I think they should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| But I do think that they need to write the checks no later than, I think, Friday of the week is May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| So, Richard, do you see a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| No, that would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Could I just make a comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| We've got quite a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Well, I just don't know if that's part of the original motion that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| It's not part of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| But, I mean, what happens if they, on May 30th, they take a box full of papers down there and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| here you go, we're cleared, or they take this chart that they showed us a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| a big chart that they put up that they cleared everybody, and say, we're clearing ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| Where does that leave Richard Walz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| I guess Richard can say that he doesn't accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| Let Mr. Walz chime in on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| No, I'll be happy to do whatever, you know, you guys want us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| And you probably do need to set a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| How about we set the deadline that documentations must be turned in by this Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| and the checks must be turned in by next Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Are you making a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| If you would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| I will accept it to have everything in by this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| If not, we expect the checks to be written by May 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| or the law director will file suit to collect these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| That sounds good with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| We have a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| Does the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| Well, he's gone to the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| In the meantime, Mr. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| You'll be at the bottom all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Quick question for the, and I don't think it's for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| because I think he's actually spoke on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| and I think we need to be crystal clear going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| and that's as we talk about receipts, as we talk about columns E and F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| Ms. Bone is not part of that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| So when we throw dollar amounts out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| we're always throwing the $8,000 amount out and the $29,000 amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| That's not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Is that right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| That is minus what Ms. Bone has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| And minus Cynthia Finch because she's in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| Ms. Bone is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Cynthia Finch still is up for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| She is in litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| but we're looking at these hard numbers in columns E and F for collection from Ms. Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4673)|
| 1:18:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| But as far as Ms. Bone, her bill is through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| So, Commissioner Moore, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| That was easy, see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| It wasn't an hour ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Commissioner Pinks is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Richard Wallace, real quick, we asked that the state comptroller be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Okay, we requested that they be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| They declined because they did not want to set a precedent of appearing for legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| They have never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I was unaware of that when we started this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| and they did not want this to be the first of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| And they feel the report speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Okay, I just have a question just because I was not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| I was appointed February 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Bone, who is responsible in column E and column F, accounts for about, well, 11,000-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:14| But let's say it's 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| But if you take the grand total of everybody from Ragsdale, Lloyd, Arms, Vanderbate, Warner, Finch, Bone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| you combine E and F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| you're looking at a total of $40,000 of insufficient or missing funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| Now, Bone's total was 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| That represents one-fourth of the money that we're wondering about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| My question is for our law director, just because I'm not aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| what kind was the information that you gathered from her valuable enough to release her responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4790)|
| 1:19:58| of one-fourth of the total that we're after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Yes, and we also met with members of my department, met with Hugh Holt over a period of many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:15| We also met with Ms. Bone and her attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| We went over receipt after receipt, charge after charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| A number of her charges were made at the direction of Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:37| It was, therefore, determined that Ms. Bone should not be held responsible for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| That's what I did not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| I've got a question sort of about procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| What we're accepting is documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| Would a visa statement from a certain motel saying a cardholder was at that location for a couple of nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:15| as in the case of Mr. Arms, is that documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| I'm just trying to clear that up in my own mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Mr. Wallace, for your purposes, would that be sufficient documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| No, the only sufficient documentation for a lodging stay would be a receipt from the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| The fact that it just says, you know, Hilton, Sheraton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| whatever on your statement would not be sufficient documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| You would actually need the receipt from the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:59| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| I'll tell you what, it's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| We've been here over 10 hours, going on 11 hours now with just an hour break for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| And this is getting awfully confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| The bottom line is, is Knox County procurement code specifically says you can't charge food at local restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:28| It says you can't charge alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| I think we're getting way, way off talking about there are some missing receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| But, I mean, threatening to go and do an audit of the entire county for missing receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| when there are only a few cards, and I'm not going to pick on the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| It's not so much the individuals that were the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| It was the open-ended P cards that allowed people to make inappropriate charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| It wasn't the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| If I had had one of those cards, I might have accidentally used it by mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| The cards that were open-ended allowed folks to charge liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| They allowed folks to charge more for food than they should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| They allowed folks to use them at restaurants, you know, that they should not have used them at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| I don't want to put any blame on anyone here, but I'm voting for this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| I think these folks need to pay this money back, and so I plan to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| And, like I said, let's try to get out of here sometime in the next little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| I've got a question for Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Dwight, if I understood what you said, you said the policy in Knox County is you don't buy alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| but the purchasing card is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| The travel policy explicitly prohibits the purchase of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| The P card policy is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| What is, hypothetically, the P card policy on strip joints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:10| If you want to go to an adult entertainment business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| Is it silent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| I don't want to get into hypothetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Well, I mean, is it silent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| I mean, to tell you all, if you go to a strip club, you'll pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| Well, and that's the thing, but it's silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| The P card program doesn't clearly say that you can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| So if your argument is that you don't buy alcohol because the P card program doesn't say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| do we need to put everything in there for you guys to know exactly what you're not supposed to do, or can you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| I'll be glad to answer that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Look at your own situation when you charged meals on Knox County P cards through us and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| I think that makes it pretty clear for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Mr. Mayor, I'll make it perfectly clear to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| When we're out somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| I don't know if we're getting into personal, but keep it strictly on what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| You know, when we're out somewhere, and if we went to O. Abbott's Grill in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| and you jump up and say, I'm going to pick up the tab, I didn't look at your credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| I didn't know what a P card was until all this really started happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| I didn't think people could put meals on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Let's take it a little bit a step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| You knew it because I announced I'm putting on a P card and said, don't claim per diem because I'm paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| The second thing is, too, Commissioner, we've had people call my staff members and tell them to come across town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| and then hand them the tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Knox County commissioners do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| I've not done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| But you've been at the meeting when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| And what we've tried to do is to do the very best we can with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| I think Mr. Briggs is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| We've made lots of mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| I've acknowledged them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| And I don't have a problem with your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| but I do think it goes a little bit too far in some cases when you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| I was at NACO with you and it was charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| I don't know the exact dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| I was sitting with you at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| So if you want to do that, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| That doesn't trouble us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| But the fact of the matter is, let's at least be reasonable about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| We've tried to acknowledge where the errors were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| I've never stood up here and said, gee, we've never made a single mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| I've said we've made lots of mistakes and we've tried to acknowledge them and tried to fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| On the other hand, I thought Commissioner Wright's point was just completely right on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| There are instances when you know it was legitimate Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| We can't go back and get a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| You know we can't go back because typically audits don't go back five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| and people don't keep receipts that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| But we'll do the very best we can to work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| and we'll provide the very best documentation that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| And when there are errors, I'm like Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| I'll be glad to write a check if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| It doesn't bother me in the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| On the other hand, I do think it's a bad situation if someone just happens to lose a receipt from years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| that you ask them to pay it back when you may have even been there with them attending the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Well, Mr. Mayor, you shouldn't have went this long before it was caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| You shouldn't have been reimbursed, period, for not turning in a receipt at a motel or a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| You shouldn't have been reimbursed four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| So now you're getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| It's catching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| We'll look at yours and we'll see what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| I'm sure you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| You probably already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| But if I've done something wrong, then I'll pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| I won't be down here for eight months trying to fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| If they say I've done something improper, we'll write a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| I'm not trying to fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| You don't hear me fighting your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| But, you know, I think any other employee in Knox County would be treated just the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| They wouldn't have already had their money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| I just want to make a quick point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| I don't know if this is considered to be reasonable or unreasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| but I think if the mayor or these other people on the staff were in the process of doing government business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:33| and you can look at where they paid to go to a conference, you have the airline ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| you have two or three nights hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| that I think a reasonable person would say that that person was probably on government business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| Yes, they didn't follow the policy by not having the receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| Perhaps the receipt got lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| But I think it was a little bit so many hours ago that Commissioner Daniels had suggested that two people look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| And, I mean, if it's a pilot gas card and it's for $30, it was probably for gas and not alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| I mean, you know, I think we need to look at this, what a reasonable person would say if it's justified or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| Is that in the form of a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| I think I would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| And it's really, I mean, I don't know who will make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| I thought what Commissioner Daniels said was pretty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| We had two commissioners and the auditor look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| And if they think that's what a reasonable person would do, I think we should accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| Because people should not have to pay when they were on government business just because five years later there's a receipt missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| that in this case may or may not be their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| So really what you're doing is, excuse me for interrupting, Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| is asking the auditor when presented with newly found receipts or previously found receipts to apply a reasonable man standard of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5319)|
| 1:28:49| If it appears that a reasonable person would say this is government business, I don't think they should have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| I'd like to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Is that a substitute or is that in addition to the existing motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| It's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| I think it's a substitute motion, but really it's more of an amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| Well, you can make it as an amendment to the motion and we could vote on that as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| Well, okay, that's what I would like to do because I agree with what Commissioner Morris has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| I won't accept that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| I mean, guys, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| We've had eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| People want something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| You're trying to derail it again, put obstacles in front of everything again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| to continue this on until this administration is out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| I agree with what you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| I would like to make a substitute motion that is exactly what Commissioner Morris said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| with the provision that if we look at this and a reasonable person would say this is a government expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| they shouldn't have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| But I think the deadline should stay where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Friday week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| Are you incorporating that the documents must be in by this Friday and payment by next Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| I think we need to expedite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| I agree completely with Commissioner Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I don't want this thing dragging on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| I think it's been going on long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| And that's why I was asking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| we need to put a time limit as to when those documents need to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| And I was just saying this Friday as a, you know, as something to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:23| If you want to make it tomorrow or Wednesday, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| I was just trying to say Friday is one deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| And for documents to be in so that Richard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| and whoever else is going to examine them has ample time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| I think they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| I think that it would be reasonable for them to go through their statements if they don't have receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| and put notations on those for Richard to look at and make a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| I think Richard needs a deadline when he would have to have those in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| I think that's exactly what Commissioner Morris said, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| And then if those are rejected, we're a reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| I think they need to pay the next by week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| Give Richard a week to look those over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| And then by next Friday they come up with a final number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| I will be in support of Commissioner Briggs' motion because I think it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| I don't have a problem with the motion, with the timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| I don't have a problem with them paying back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| I worked for my company for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| There have been times when I've had to pay back some things because of insufficient documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| But I do believe that, for example, on the NACO conferences, we keep going back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| It's pretty obvious, I think, that that's a legitimate business expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| So any of these legitimate expenses that a reasonable person would adhere to, I'm going to support that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| But I do have a question of Hugh, Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| In reviewing this, we talk about email alerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| I know that if something comes in and it's not really – explain to me how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| Is that a daily thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| Is it a weekly thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| It's called the permit and notify function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| It's just a flag that tells us that certain activity has taken place on a particular card based on the cardholder profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:23| For example, travel and entertainment, unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Just as I said earlier, horse feed at the co-op.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| Photography, development, supplies, like at Walgreens, that comes up unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| And, again, it all goes back to what level the merchant is willing to report at and their levels of reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:50| And, for example, if your card was blocked for alcohol purchases, say, for example, and it wasn't blocked for food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:59| if you went to a restaurant that didn't break it down that way from a bar tab to a restaurant tab, then it's not going to catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5579)|
| 1:33:08| So, again, as I told Mr. Walls in the past, that it's not an auditing tool at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:16| It's actually an imperfect auditing tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| It only flags us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| It's sort of a big brother type mechanism where I can pick up the phone and call and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| I've got a charge here at the Mellow Mushroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| And we just want to make sure no one has stolen the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| Have you had any, you say, unusual purchases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| Has there been anything outside the mayor's office that you've been flagged for that you have gotten some kind of alerts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| For example, the Mellow Mushroom or Walgreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| What was the Mellow Mushroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| It was pizza for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| They had to work after hours, and they were feeding their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:10| And, like I said, the other one is Walgreens, the co-op.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| There are several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| The PCART administrator is the one who is responsible for that, and that's Mr. Munafoe, who is sitting right behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:27| He hasn't been sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Why would the Mellow Mushroom thing be flagged if it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| It falls into the category of T&E, which would be a restaurant charge, travel and entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:45| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| I'll make it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| I think it's appalling that we're continuing to let people stand in the way of two professional auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| the state comptroller and the Knox County auditor, to continue to delay and delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| And I hope the citizens of Knox County are home watching the people who tried to delay this once again for this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Do you agree to the price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| We're talking about this NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| I've never been on one, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| But you went to one in Nashville here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| Are you entitled to take your spouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| I hear it says one spouse, early bird, $110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| That was a NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| That's what it said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| It says NACO County member, early bird, U-440, and then spouse, $110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| But what I'm really concerned about, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| Let me explain that spouse registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| NACO, and I think other people have taken their wives to NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| I think some of you other county commissioners have taken them to NACO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| When I registered, I paid that $110 at the exact time of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| So, in effect, I gave Knox County my money 30 days before the event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| So what happened, we registered for the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| My wife was going to attend the NACO conference in Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| I wrote the check before the conference happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| I wrote the check before the conference ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| And you can go back and look at the date of the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| So, in other words, NACO has spousal registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| And so she was going on that trip, and I wrote the check at the time we registered for the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| According to this, it's in Nashville at the Renaissance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| Now, the NACO conference, the only time she's ever gone with me was the conference in Richmond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| and that's where I wrote the $110 check for a conference in Richmond, Virginia, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| What I'm really concerned about, sir, too, it says here on this Nashville deal, you still work for SAIC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5815)|
| 1:37:05| My employment at SAIC was disclosed when I came to work here two hours a week, average, two hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| Never in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| Well, Rewind, you paid for this with the SAIC credit card, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| What was the SAIC credit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| Well, right here it says William M. Arms, SAIC, Fox Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| When we were at reimbursement, Knox County did, $800.26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| What was that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| Renaissance Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| April the third of, I mean, April the 12th, 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:47| I don't recall that, but the SAIC credit card is just like a credit card from O&L Credit Union or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:56| SAIC never pays their credit card bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| The employee pays them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Well, you used it to, why did you not pay that with your P-card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| What year was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| 2007, April the 12th, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| Oh, we didn't have a P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| I haven't had a P-card in over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Well, why did you not get per diem on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| You paid over the rate too, sir, on the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| I believe August the mayor came up here and said everybody wouldn't be in per diem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| Well, I'll go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| I think we did file per diem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| I mean, ever since we gave up P-cards, we always filed per diem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| We never get paid more than per diem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Well, you paid more for the hotel rate down there than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| Let me interject that the travel policy does allow when there is a conference hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| you are allowed to go over the standard rate if the conference is at that hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| so there could be a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| Is that where the conference was held at, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| The Renaissance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Now, that was at NACO, because NACO has never been at the National Renaissance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| It may be Tennessee County Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| I'd like to go ahead and look at the date, but the NACO conference was, I know NACO has never been in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| Tennessee County Services may have been in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| I think it was Tennessee County Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| You say you never had a P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| When did we turn our P-cards in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| It wasn't until after June of 2007, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| When did we turn P-cards in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| It was not until after June of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| You were not exposed until June of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| That's nine months ago, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| You know, there's a lot of times I've never used my P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| I mean, if you look at my P-card account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:12| Mike, that April 7th was Tennessee County Services because I was chairman of the nominating committee that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| You worked for the county mayor in 2003, is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| Correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| And I worked for the county commissioner at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| And I resigned as county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| In what year, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| Shortly after coming on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| In 2003, you went to Washington, D.C., NACO conference as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:47| I may have gone as a county commissioner, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| So if I were registered as a county commissioner, I did it through JOLI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| Most county commissioners that I know of, I'm going to ask you this, Mr. Lupo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| when you come down here to these meetings, do you clock out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| I certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Actually, today I just never clocked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| You know that you were paid to the mayor's office for 40 hours while you were up there on county commission business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| In NACO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Well, I'm going to turn the time sheet in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| Well, I'm paid the same every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| I'm paid the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| If you look at all my time sheets, I know you look at every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| Sometimes it shows 47 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Sometimes it shows 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| I'm paid the same amount whether I work 40 hours or 52 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| You're paid the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Mr. Payson, we need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| You're not working like Mr. Lupo over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| He has to clock out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| He does not get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Is that not correct, Mr. Lupo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| Well, I end up using either comp time or vacation time for when I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6110)|
| 1:42:01| Which is my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Mr. Harms did not use any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| I would like to go back to what Mark Harmon said about the definition of sufficient documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| I think using this terminology of what a reasonable person would consider appropriate for documentation is rather ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:24| We're talking about three of the people here, Ragsdale, Arms, Vandivate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| If you would add up what they owe, I mean total what we're looking, because now we don't count Ms. Bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| So now we're going after $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| Now, this body did not want to do anything with the auto and travel allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| and we had the internal auditors say that Ragsdale, Arms, and Vandivate were actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6166)|
| 1:42:54| they collectively received $32,000 of an arbitrary salary increase, which, of course, we disputed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6174)|
| 1:43:03| And there was nothing done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| So I just really question how many reasonable people we have around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| and I think that that is just an ambiguous terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| and I don't think that, I really think that we don't need to be putting our internal auditor in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:18| I was mentioned individually, so let me just take a point of privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| And also to mention that the reasonable man standard is not something that I invented today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| It's something that courts have used and that others have used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| And it was just a way of getting us out of this dilemma that has now us going many, many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| It was not an intent to invent a standard or to create an unreasonable one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| And I didn't mean to be accusatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| I'm just questioning how many reasonable people we have in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| Oh, it depends on who you ask and what time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| How many hours I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| We have something else, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| Are we going to discuss anything else about these P cards after this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| I intend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| I just want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| This vote is not going to call an adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Could you repeat it, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| It's that the money in question or the records in question will be looked at to see if there's documentation by this Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:30| on those that do not have receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| Then we can use a standard of what a reasonable person would say that this was county businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| the evidence there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| That all needs to be accomplished by this Friday to get the information together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| And then by a week from Friday, after Mr. Walls reviews that, the sums that cannot be accounted for have to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| You were going to have two people, two commissioners take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| I have a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| Who seconded the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| Since we are using the reasonable man standard and that has been used in courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| I propose that we let our law director determine, apply that standard to these charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| I would note that, point of order, Mr. Chairman, I would note that Mr. Briggs' item came up as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:29| So this would be an amendment on top of an amendment, which I believe is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| It's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| I thought it was called a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| No, his was a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| Mine is a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Not necessarily the law director, but someone from our legal department to apply that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| The Chair has answered you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| Do you have a problem in assessing these insufficient documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6354)|
| 1:46:03| and missing receipt issues using the reasonable man standard or reasonable person standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| Do you have a problem doing that yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| I think possibly, you know, we can compile the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| but maybe to look at it with other people might be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:25| whether it be you or one commissioner or two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Well, if we have two commissioners, we're going to have a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| But I think, you know, so that there won't be any question on, you know, what my decision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| I think it would be helpful to possibly have, you know, a third party, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| whether it be somebody from your department and a commissioner or two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| But I believe that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| If we're going to have the documentation in by this Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| why can't it just be presented to the full commission on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| and we'll just hopefully very quickly review it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| I would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| Could we have a citizen be the commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:13| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| How about Louis Cosby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| Who I was going to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| Would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| I wouldn't go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| He's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| He's out of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| He's out of town this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| What about next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| They're not going to get the information until Friday anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| How about Larry Van Gilder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| No, we don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| No, you don't want the president for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| But, Mr. Cosby, I think we'll be out of town this week and next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:48| I'd say if you all want to do this, let's just clear them and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| Because I guarantee you, at the end of the day, it will be down to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| It won't even be worth them going through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| Because I guarantee you it will be enough reasonable doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| and they can show you a napkin where I came back from the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| So, you know, if we ain't going to take it seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I'd say let's just close up our book and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| If I could make a motion, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Because if that's what this commission wants to do, I'm tired of sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| We've got an audit and we just seem to want to keep closing the book on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| after we've paid all this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| So, I mean, I think we've wasted more money than we're going to collect now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| We have substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| Do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| I was wondering if what we suggested initially was if we had Commissioner Daniel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| and then maybe have one other person look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| You suggested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| I did, but because of the fact that I've done audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| I would prefer there be somebody who hasn't, that's just a reasonable person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| that hasn't done that type of thing, that can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| If I look at it, I'm going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| Commissioner Daniel doesn't believe he's a reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| Victoria said I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| If members of this commission apply that standard, then no matter how it's applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| the perception is going to be if they let them get by with some stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| oh, that was the mayor's friends on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Or if they're extremely tough, the perception is going to be, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| that's those commissioners that are mad at the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| That's why I think we need a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| What about would Judge Creekmore be okay with you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| He's with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| What about Judge Rawson, city judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| We said someone from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| What about the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| I think we need to just go back to our auditor to make that determination whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| or not the documentation meets the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| That's our professional, and that's who we ought to stick with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| I'll concede.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| You're not going to put that in your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| That's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| We'll just use it to the auditor's judgment if a reasonable person would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| I'll take that because I think we've discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| It was in the original motion anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| You never had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Chairman Strickland, I'd like a minute to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| Who is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| I live at 3037 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| I think there's a large group of people that have not been represented here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| and that's the Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| And with the exception of Elaine Davis, Scott Moore, Victoria DeFreeze, and Paul Pingston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| I am embarrassed to say that I live in Knox County and that I am a Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:51| I think the fact that Knox County got in the New York Times, that this whole thing is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6651)|
| 1:51:00| it sort of speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| And with all the cameras here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| I hope and pray that somebody got some good shots of the snake pit over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| all the whispering and winking and giggling and sly grins and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| And I guarantee you the taxpayers are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| This is our money you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| And I guarantee you there are a lot of them out there that are really, really upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| And I just think it's important that somebody say publicly, taxpayers, whoever you are, you know, call your commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:36| We need to band together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| We need to meet in the hall on the sixth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| Something has got to be done because you guys are just not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| I'll give you my name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| It's Patty Walker, 3037 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| You have something, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| I just got a text from Brian Hornbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| He's willing to be, to apply the reasonable man standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| I think we need to just leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Well, the motion is not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| So we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| I'd like to have it by roll call, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| If I'm confused, surely there's somebody else here that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| What is the motion and what has been pulled off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| Put it on the table to add two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| So we're not adding commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| We've got Mr. Walls, who's going to receive documentation by this Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| and who's going to review that over the next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| and make a determination as to what is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| By the following Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| I thought he was not in agreement with, he was not feeling comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| He agreed to it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| See?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| There are no reasonable people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| He works for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| He works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| We tell him to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| He's to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| So by next Friday, a week from this Friday, Mr. Walls is going to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| And if he sees, for instance, a conference that Mayor Ragsdale went and attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:20| and he gives Mayor Ragsdale credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| He's going to deduct that from the overall item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| And by a week from Friday, Mr. Walls is going to come to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| as well as to the mayor and the other persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| and he's going to say, this is what you owe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| and how long are they going to get to repay that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| Friday, May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| The following Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| The documentations must be turned in by this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| He's going to make his determination by this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| Documentation must be turned in by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| And you're going to have to give him some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| And he'll have time to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| And then by the following Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| when is he going to notify the mayor and Dwight Vander Veidt and others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| How about him notifying the mayor by May 30th and then payment due by June, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:12| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| We need to know, and Mr. Walls and I need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| and we need direction from this body on what you're asking him to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| and when the final deadline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| And so the mayor then has an expectation of when that deadline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| And the mayor, if there are monies left remaining that are owed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| the mayor can pay the money or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| And if he doesn't pay the money, I need to know by what date you wish for me to file suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| Commissioner Briggs, can you restate your motion with those recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| May I ask Richard something just a moment, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Richard, if they have those receipts to you, say, by 12 o'clock this coming Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| how long would it take you to find out, check them out, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| We should be able to compile that fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| You should probably know then by maybe Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| You could know by Wednesday, then we could set the date to pay if they owe anything Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| Friday, May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| And they should have it in the amendment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| I think we can stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| 12 o'clock Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| My motion, Richard Walls, is to notify the mayor and whoever else that may owe money by Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:28| By the close of business Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| By the close of business Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| And do by the close of business Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| Any receipts after 12 o'clock Friday, this coming Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| We're not accepting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| We're not accepting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| Is that acceptable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I would also like to receive a copy of what is turned in to Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| I mean, I think commission should look at that documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| Now, what you're assuming is there's going to be something else turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| You're not just accepting an explanation right now that's already within the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:04| Mr. Walls is going to physically receive something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| Or has already received something else that he has denied because it's not a receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| Is everybody clear on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| I'd like to speak against the motion, and I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| We're going to end up with the mayor and his staff saying they've turned stuff in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| Mr. Walls may agree or disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| But if he disagrees, then they're going to disagree with Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| And he works for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| And we've turned stuff over, and we shouldn't have to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| It's going to be an ongoing saga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| He can disagree with the audit now and decide to fight this in court if he decides to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:49| We're not going to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Well, how much is the audit cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| I think we've given a deadline, and I think we need to stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| And we need to trust our professional here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| Well, he's already gave us this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| And we evidently don't trust him very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| And I'm appalled at this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| And I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| And hopefully we get back on the motion, the first motion, not substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:18| I think that's what the citizens of this county want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| And we need to quit playing games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| I guarantee you, Commissioner Moore, I ain't playing games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| Well, we're doing something because we're not taking the money that we've paid for this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| We're going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| Roll call, stone and a knife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7062)|

| 1:58:40| Thirteen yes, four no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| Mr. Chairman, I'd make a motion we just go home and forget the rest of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| His light wasn't on and he wasn't recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| I want to make a motion because I agree with what our citizens said about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| that this is a very serious breach of the public trust and confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| There's been appalling accounting practices that have taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7142)|
| 1:59:09| and we do hold the mayor and the mayor's office to a higher standard than we do the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:15| I don't think that just paying back what they owe gets them completely off the hook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| and I would like to make a motion that this commission censure the mayor for insufficient accountings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7160)|
| 1:59:27| and failing his duties as mayor on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| If we would have had proper accounting, none of this would have ever occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| I will freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| I was going to add another motion I was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| I'll make it after we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| We have a motion on the floor to censure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| And what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| That's going to be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| It's the commission's intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| It's your expression of intent that the mayor has not complied with policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7205)|
| 2:00:12| What's it worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| The paper it's written on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| But, you know, it's your official action that you certainly disagree with the way that the mayor has conducted himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:25| with relation to this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| It's your official word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| What's it worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| I know we can, but how could anybody that just voted yes vote to censure him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:41| I plan on voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| Would you like an answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| Well, we have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Can I comment to that since it was my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| What it is, is that all we said on the last one is he pays back what he owes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| He's not going to have to pay back money that he doesn't owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| And we're voting on this saying that the accounting practices that led to this entire audit were not satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| They were not tolerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| So this isn't like a congressional censure where I think on the federal level they can't officially address the assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7276)|
| 2:01:25| He can still talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| It's just a symbol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| Well, I just wanted to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| My whole thing is if a person is on county business, doing work for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| and he or she, for whatever reason, made mistakes, then that person still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:49| it doesn't diminish the fact that county business was conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| And, again, if they can say I was in the city at the same time, several people may have went with me at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7314)|
| 2:02:02| I can produce a significant amount, a reasonable amount of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| then I don't think that person should have to pay for that out of their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| It has nothing to do with the practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| I'm in total agreement that this process was more than flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| This was appalling is the best word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| But it doesn't say that these people need to come out of their own pocket because they were on county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| So that's my whole reason for voting for that particular member and for my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:39| And I will vote to censure the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| If I were voting, I'm not so sure I wouldn't vote the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| From the very beginning, I've made official apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| I've said and acknowledged the things I've done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| I understand your anger, and I'm respectful of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| On the other hand, you all have done some things that have angered me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| So that feeling sort of cuts both ways, to be truthful with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| Every time I bring that up, you say, well, don't bring up us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| But, you know, I wasn't the one that, well, I'm not even going to go there to be truthful with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| But you all have had some instances of your own that I would hope you consider looking at them as you go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| But the fact of the matter is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| We've made no secret that we've made mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| There are too many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| And I think Mr. McKenzie's point was perhaps one of the better ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| and that is look at the legitimacy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| Legitimacy is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| The receipt keeping was poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| We did a poor job of keeping receipts, a very poor job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| So if this makes you feel better, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| And I'll be the first to acknowledge that we did a very poor job of keeping receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| However, I do think the majority of this business was very appropriate county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| and you don't have to look far to see the results of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| Commissioner Moore, can you recognize Commissioner Daniels first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| Thank you, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| You know, in all of this, Victoria made a very good point about, you know, how reasonable are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| But I guess the reasonableness that I want to see is that some of the people that don't have receipts wasn't the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:13| keeping the receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| You know, in any business concern, you turn those receipts over to a receipt keeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| They've admitted that there was four or five people handling those receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| You know, a lot of us have worked for companies, and, you know, companies don't keep receipts that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| And, you know, they'll put them in boxes, and they are hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| But I think the main thing is, you know, I want the county to get paid back the money that we're owed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7476)|
| 2:04:44| But I want to be fair to everyone and not just be a case of if someone lost your receipt, I don't think it's right for you to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7484)|
| 2:04:53| If there's a paper trail that shows you were there, you know, that's reasonableness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| You know, if there's an airline ticket, if there's a parking ticket, if there's, I know on one, there was a charge for gasoline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| obviously a rental car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| So somebody obviously went to that place and was there for there to be a charge for gasoline and a rental car at that city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:16| I just don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| I mean, I wouldn't want somebody doing me that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| And, you know, I respect the lady that spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| You know, I'm disgusted with a lot of the stuff that's gone on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| That's the reason I'm on commission is trying to help fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| But I don't think fixing it is going and just making people pay for stuff because it's an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7528)|
| 2:05:36| The tough thing to do is to ask Richard to apply reasonableness to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| And I think he'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| I think Richard's proven his thoroughness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| And I have no doubt that when Richard looks at this, applying a little different standard to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| that whatever Richard says, I think we can all live with because I think he is a fair man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Yes, I just wanted to say that I'm going to vote for censure as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| And it's not because I'm disappointed in the programs that you have started, Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| I'm disappointed in judgment calls that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| And I think that one of your primary responsibilities is the chief financial officer for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:18| And that reflects back on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| And that flows down from you and your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| And I would like to know that you have made changes in policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| You have made corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| But I hope that we are making better judgments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| Commissioner, we're back to Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7598)|
| 2:06:46| I don't even remember what I want to say now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| But you're talking about if this is just a piece of paper, I mean, let's save somebody the time of writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| and save the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| I don't know how you vote to censure somebody when you've just said any receipt will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7616)|
| 2:07:05| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| We had 12 bogus receipts turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7641)|
| 2:07:29| And I think this body should have that information forwarded to the district attorney's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7649)|
| 2:07:36| for them to examine it and to see if there is further action that they should proceed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7656)|
| 2:07:44| And I'd like to make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| I'd like to have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Commissioner Paxton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| Yes, I'd like to call Richard up to the stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7673)|
| 2:08:00| Richard, is there any possibility that there could be more bogus receipts in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| Those are the only ones we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Mr. Harms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Mr. Harms, it's my understanding that you and John Troyer terminated Cynthia Finch over these receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| That's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Did she quit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| She resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| She says she didn't, but did that lead to the resignation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| Those receipts were the crust of the resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| And, actually, I've got the date notation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| I think it was on February the 12th when we were notified of some receipts that just were not, just didn't look legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:57| And we met, actually went down and discussed these receipts with Mr. Walsh on that day, looked at the receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7737)|
| 2:09:05| We could tell that the receipts were not legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| The next day we arranged for a meeting, and Mr. Troyer was in the meeting with me for the duration of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| We discussed these with Ms. Finch for about 90 minutes and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| And I documented with a client attorney privilege memo to the law office the fact that she had resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7762)|
| 2:09:31| And Mr. Troyer, I think, documented the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| It was basically based on these 12 receipts we asked her the background and couldn't get a reasonable answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:43| and suggested to her what would be a good course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| And she said, I think I should resign, and I accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| Then the rest of the story is, I think, later on that night she changed her mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| but we didn't change our mind on accepting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| Do you think there are any more bogus receipts in these P cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:05| I don't know of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| Those 12, as Mr. Walsh said, stood out as pretty flagrant examples of receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7806)|
| 2:10:17| Who turned in this bogus receipt on Jay's Mega Mart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| I don't know if there's a bogus receipt on Jay's Mega Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| If it was a receipt for gas and they don't sell gas, who turned that receipt in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| I would consider that bogus if it, you know, if you turn a receipt in saying you bought gas somewhere and don't sell gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| Would that not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| I think that would be bogus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| He got you back with a T-shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| Wouldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| I think that was a legitimate receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| I think there was a legitimate P card charge on that that later on when you're trying to document what the perk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:53| I think that was part of the documentation where people were trying to say what was that P card charge for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:59| But that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| And they said it was for gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| I assume it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| I mean, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| I mean, they said gas, didn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| I assume they said gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| But that was the best document, the best guess on what a P card charge was for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| than actually generating 12 receipts that someone produced 12 receipts that basically said, here are the items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:29| here's what they're for, and the receipts were generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| The receipts were produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| The false sheets were produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| And a statement was signed to the auditor saying these 12 receipts matched the P card charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:46| So those receipts were actually purely fabricated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| That's the only document you can see, just like this piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| Well, in other words, we've got no control whatsoever on P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| If I went down here at Regas, me and my wife, in Ede, and I come back and just turned it in and said I was down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:07| on county business or something, then that would be a legitimate receipt in what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| When you can just go down there, you're saying you can just go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| and come up with a reason what you thought this was used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| Well, you said somebody that you all come up with the idea that it was for gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| That was the most logical thing you could think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7945)|
| 2:12:33| Mr. Walsh, would you come to the stand, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:41| Did you receive a receipt from Jay's Megamart for gas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| There was no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| There was no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| There was no receipt turned in for Jay's Megamart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| Now, that was included in an explanation in the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| What did it say in the explanation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| Gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7982)|
| 2:13:09| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| I believe it's Exhibit 3-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=7992)|
| 2:13:22| Boy, you've got a good memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:33| I believe it's Exhibit 3-1, 5 of 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| And I might add that that was paid back on last week sometime after we issued the final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8017)|
| 2:13:49| So that's charge number 59-930-05, Jay's Megamart 1965, gas only purchase for Knox County vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8029)|
| 2:14:00| How could somebody possibly come up as they bought gas at a place like that that doesn't even sell gas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:07| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| Well, what I'm saying is there could be more of these that are just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| It just so happens these people don't sell gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| That's why we caught this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:28| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| I'm going to speak against sending something to Attorney General Randy Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| I mean, Randy is a capable attorney general who I'm sure has read the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| He is aware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| We can't make a decision on commission how to handle things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| and then we pass a censor and then we're going to tell Randy Nichols to look into it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| so we can walk out of here and say we were tough today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| So I'm voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| I know Randy Nichols already looked into it if he's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| I don't think we need to waste some more paper and people's time to send Randy Nichols a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8102)|
| 2:15:11| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| Would you define the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| It's to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| It's to ask the law director to send the audit over to the district attorney about the 12 bogus receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8119)|
| 2:15:30| and to have him investigate it and deal with it however he feels proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8130)|
| 2:15:36| I have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| Do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| Yes, I want to ask Richard some more things here in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| Is this on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Mr. Chairman, could I ask the law director just to weigh in on what Mr. Nichols might or might not do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| He will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| He may take it to the grand jury to see if there's probable cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| That a crime has been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| There's a reasonable doubt standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| But I'll be glad to send it to him for your wishes and he can make that judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:10| That's his determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Will you report back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Oh, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| Sixteen yes, one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| Richard, I'd like to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| We're still talking about P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| These club membership fees, is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:46| We felt that was improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| Is this listed in this money that they're going to pay back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| It's listed in that insufficient documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| I believe that's in the that falls in the category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| There was a receipt, but we did not feel there was a sufficient business purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| Mr. Troyer, on these charges, aren't your supervisors supposed to sign off on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| Who signed off on these club memberships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| I don't have the documentation in front of me, and maybe Mr. Wallis has that documentation in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:31| I do know that Mr. Owings has this under litigation and is currently in Chancery Court seeking payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8251)|
| 2:17:39| and he's already taken action to retrieve this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| I'm not talking about the payment or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| Who signed off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| Who was the supervisor that signed off on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| I don't have the documentation in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| Maybe Mr. Wallis does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| Who was her supervisor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| Mr. Arms was her supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| Mr. Arms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| Did you sign off on this documentation, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| I can go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| I know P cards are at department levels, and every department level was responsible for P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:20| But I can go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| You don't recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| I mean, we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| Who would it have had to be in the supervisory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| If you're her supervisor, who would be the next up from you that she would have had to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| Well, the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| In other words, it either had to be you or the mayor won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| It could have been, but what I'm saying is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| Well, isn't a supervisor supposed to sign off, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| At department levels, department managers rectify their own P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| And I'm not saying I didn't sign off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| I'll go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| If you weren't there to sign off on it, would it have had to have been the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| What I'm saying is that P cards are designated to department levels, and each department level was responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:12| for their own P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| So, in effect, senior managers looked at their own P card charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| Maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| Which we reconciled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| I mean, that was one of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| When we said mistakes were made, that's one of the things we're looking at now on how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8364)|
| 2:19:30| Maybe I misunderstood Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| I thought he said that a supervisor was supposed to sign off on his P card charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:44| I'm not denying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| I'm going to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| Is Mr. Troyer right in saying a supervisor is supposed to sign off on P card charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| At departmental levels, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| At departmental levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| And we've got acknowledgment from the mayor himself to say the procedures weren't followed 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| We already acknowledged that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| Mr. Arms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| There were a lot of things that went on over at Club LeConte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| I've seen where you went over there several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| Did you go on this membership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| I have a private membership and I pay the dues out of my own check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| And I've got a list of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Any other Knox County employee up there use this membership in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| The Ms. Finches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| It could have been a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Like if she had meetings for senior summits or senior programs or, you know, I know when they plan some of the senior summits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:45| They had breakfast meetings up there at Club LeConte that she may have set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| I can't speak for or against her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| I don't want to point a finger at anyone else using her card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| My card was a personal account and I paid the membership dues out of my own pocket every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8456)|
| 2:21:06| But if there was a specific item that was a Knox County function, that's what I got reimbursement for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| And since that point in time, even though we've had events up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| realizing the perception of Club LeConte, even though it's very accessible if you're downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:28| everything we've used up there since then I've just personally paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| So we're out of the Club LeConte business as far as the taxpayer is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| Cynthia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| Cynthia there was receiving travel reimbursement from her sorority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| while charging her sorority expenses to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| Did you or the mayor sign off on this, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| I specifically asked Ms. Finch if she ever what's called double-dipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| I said at any point in time did you use your and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| I've asked her that more than once and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| Troyer was in the room when I asked her that question point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| And her and I want to try to paraphrase this, but I want to try to give you her perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:24| that the two years that she was the president of that sorority, she received a stipend for certain events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8544)|
| 2:22:32| She received a stipend for the presidency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| And she used that stipend to do travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| And I asked her did you ever receive stipend money and Bill Knox County at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| She said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| But then she said after my two years as presidency, I was no longer receiving that stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| But I asked that question point blank and she said she never, I guess the term is double-dipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:58| And I did ask her that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| Of course, I had no, we had no knowledge of what the stipend she received, how she was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8580)|
| 2:23:07| how she was receiving expenses from her sorority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| But we did ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| On Exhibit 14.4 of 9, Miss Finch reported information regarding the forged receipts to John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:23| Why was this important information not forwarded to the auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| Let me answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| I'd like to address that one because that was incorrectly noted in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| The meeting that I had with the state auditors, the state auditors met with Mr. Walls and Miss Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| And I remember that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| I volunteered to sit with Miss Finch for that audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| And the state auditors brought that information to us instead of the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| So the state auditors were sharing this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| We have this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| We'd like Miss Finch to answer some questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| And so there was nothing to share with the state auditors because they already had that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| So, anyway, that's just my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| I think Mr. Walls can document that, that the state auditors showed us those, asked us about those receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:12| And as soon as we saw them, which was what, Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| maybe just a couple of days before we took action when we met with the state auditors on those receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| And I think we're getting off the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| I think we have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| I'm afraid you're running the meeting, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| Let me ask you one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Commissioner, look, I got Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| I just have something to mention after this motion, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| Do you have something, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| What motion do we have on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| I didn't know, but I-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| I don't think we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| We don't have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| Then I have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| Let me ask one more question and I'll be off it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| I thought he'd go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| No, we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| These P-card agreements were signed by all cardholders, including the mayor, Margie Lloyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8696)|
| 2:25:04| William Arms, Dwight Van DeBake, John Warner, Cynthia Finch, and Requetta Bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8704)|
| 2:25:13| And on these agreements, they said that any improper use can be considered misappropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8713)|
| 2:25:20| with disciplinary action up to termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| I just want you commissioners to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| After this whole deal today, I just think if anybody's at home watching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| I'm sure that citizens, this is only confirmed, that they have a loss of confidence and trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8736)|
| 2:25:43| that procedures and policies have not been followed, and that our charter has been-it's not been followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8743)|
| 2:25:52| And so I would like to present a motion on the floor that we-that county commission request the resignation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| of the Knox County mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| Well, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8766)|
| 2:26:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| I'll second it to have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| I'll second it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| You want the lights on, it means discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| Do you have a commissioner more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| No, I've got something else, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| Well, cut your light off until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| Just for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| Mr. Chairman, you know, I think that I don't know how many times that we've heard the mayor say he was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8797)|
| 2:26:44| he was sorry, we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| You know, and I understand what she's trying to say and the confidence level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| I think that from here on out that we're moving forward, things are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:59| I don't know how many more times today that we need to hear from the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| and or his staff that things were done wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| and Richard Wallace has got some of that on track, you know, if it continues happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| But I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| Well, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| Commissioner Hammond, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| I must admit that Commissioner DeFries has caught me a bit off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| And so I do want to say that if we're looking for people to resign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:36| and we're asking people to resign, then perhaps you should ask those of us who are on commission to also resign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:44| because we have been found guilty of violating the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| And I don't feel like that I need to step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| I don't feel like that I need to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| I feel like that during that time that we made some mistakes, we acknowledge those mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8874)|
| 2:28:02| Many of us have apologized to the community for those mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| And so the mayor has also apologized for his mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| And we have more audits to go and there are more things coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| I understand your frustration because the majority of commission did not vote with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| You felt like we should have voted another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| And I sense the frustration from you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| And I've been on the other side of votes that have not gone my way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| But to come in and now put together a motion requesting that the mayor resign, number one, I find that way out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8906)|
| 2:28:36| Secondly, we'll be voting enthusiastically against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| because if the mayor chooses to run, that's his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| And I don't think that that's something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| But if we're going to start throwing stones, let's also throw some stones back here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| I mean, we've not done everything correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| And we've made mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| And so I don't feel that any of us should step down and resign as a result of the Sunshine suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| Nor do I feel that the mayor should step down because of some of these improper receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8942)|
| 2:29:09| So I will be voting against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| And I understand your frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| I understand your disappointment in us because we didn't vote your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| But, again, we just have differences in points of view on how things should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| My name is Lela Montgomery, 911 Crown Ridge Lane, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8964)|
| 2:29:32| I keep hearing every now and then people keep talking about the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| And something beautiful happened in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| The people were notified about what happened with the Sunshine Law, and they spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| They had an opportunity to express themselves in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| The people of Knox County have spoken regarding the Sunshine Law in the most American way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:57| In my view, the Sunshine Law is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| The people have decided about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| This issue here is still up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| I just want to have an opportunity to give you the impact statement from a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9007)|
| 2:30:16| This inquisition about what's been going on with the P.T. card is less about the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9016)|
| 2:30:26| and it's more about the people of Knox County as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9026)|
| 2:30:32| This money was not taken from those that we may perceive to have a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9032)|
| 2:30:38| It was taken from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| It was taken from my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| That's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| That's a very big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| We, the citizens of Knox County, are constantly being squeezed by double-digit impacts on our utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9050)|
| 2:30:58| Our taxes continue to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| And now at a time that we find that our taxes have been being increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:12| while there's been such a discrepancy on how our money was being spent, this might not be a big deal to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9072)|
| 2:31:20| but it is to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| It is to people who have to struggle to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9082)|
| 2:31:30| Now, don't be mistaken by the empty seats here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| We're paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| A lot of the time, in me especially, because I didn't want to get involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| I didn't want to get involved in politics because it's ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9102)|
| 2:31:46| That's why a lot of people don't go to their precinct meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| That's why they don't want to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| We are paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| And February was a beautiful example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| You know, I appreciate what Mr. Briggs said and what Victoria has said and what Mr. Daniels has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9120)|
| 2:32:09| It is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| And to take it lightly and to keep bringing up the past of something that the people have already addressed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| so incredibly insensitive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| This pointing back and forth, when we're talking about this issue, this pointing back and forth, well, you did it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9140)|
| 2:32:28| Well, you did it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| It's so incredibly insensitive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| It's insensitive to the people who are paying you to make decisions, altruistic decisions on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9153)|
| 2:32:40| When you make your decisions on what to do, I would ask each and every one of you to not make the decisions based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9160)|
| 2:32:47| on whether or not you're friends with the mayor or you have very negative feelings towards the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9167)|
| 2:32:54| I want you to think about me, think about your neighbors, think about the people who entrusted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| This is not a little deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| It is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart2?start=9182)|
