| 0:00:07| I'd like to call the workshop tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=7)|

| 0:00:32| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=32)|
| 0:00:33| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=33)|
| 0:00:40| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| We have the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| Councilman Bailey, Vice Mayor Becker, Councilman Brown, Councilman Della Vopi, here, Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| Grieve, here, Councilman Palmer, here, Councilman Pavlis, Councilman Roddy, here, Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=60)|

| 0:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Once again, and I think, Marilyn, I think I'm correct when we say that if anyone objects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| we will have public forum at the end, if that's in agreement with all the council present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| With that, I'd like to introduce Bud Gilbert, who will make the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| Bud, thank you, and we'd like to welcome you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| Thank you, Chairman Grieve and members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| My name is Bud Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| I'm General Counsel to the City of Knoxville Pension Board, and my business address is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| 550 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| We're delighted to be before City Council tonight, and let me just start by saying we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| appreciate the leadership that City Council gives the Pension Board as we administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| the City of Knoxville's Employee Pension System for you and the members of that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| I'm delighted to introduce the folks that are here to present for you tonight, and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| of the members of the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| To my immediate left, and your right, is, of course, Michael Cherry, who is the Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| Director of the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| To his left is Jim York, who is one of our seven members on the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| Jim sits by virtue of his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| He is the Director of Finance for the City of Knoxville, and under Charter Section 1324,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| the Director of Finance and the Mayor of the City of Knoxville sit by virtue of their office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| or as we commonly call, ex officio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| To his left is Robin Shelton, who is one of our four elected board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| She is elected as a General Government Employee Representative, I think it's seat B, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| have two General Government Employee Reps that are elected from the ranks, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| we also have two uniform-bodied members that are elected from those ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| That leaves the seventh person, who I have not mentioned, which is a person appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=176)|
| 0:03:04| by City Council for a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| The Charter in 1324 says it can be anyone, as long as they are a resident of the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| of Knoxville, and the City Council, in its infinite wisdom, has appointed Barbara Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| who is finishing, I think, a remainder of about two years on her term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Barbara wanted to be here tonight, but as some of you know, in your past service with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| her, she takes a little bit of vacation occasionally and is restricted on when she can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| and this week, we wish we could be with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| She is in Florida somewhere at their condominium and enjoying a much-needed vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| She sends her regards to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| With that, I'll sit down and let the Chairman take control of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| Thank you, sir, and ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=235)|
| 0:04:14| Mike Cherry, Executive Director of the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Offices are located at 917B East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| I plan to just make a very general overview of the Pension System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| Obviously, I understand three of you here tonight and five are new members to the Pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| I guess I should say four brand-new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Mr. Pavlis, of course, had been on the Pension Board previously and I know he's familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| with the Pension System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| I've handed each a little packet here, which I'll just make reference to from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| It's just information that you can look at at your leisure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| The top item on there, first item in that packet, is just a chart of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| Pension System, the provisions of which are contained in Article 13 of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| At the top of that chart, you'll see, I guess, the original Pension System at the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Knoxville was for the police and fire uniformed bodies, as we refer to them, in what we now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| call the old Police and Fire Pension System, known as Plan F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| This for years was actually administered and run through the Treasurer's Office up until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=333)|
| 0:05:41| 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Then on January 1 of 2001, that responsibility for Plan F was moved over to the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=343)|
| 0:05:56| Plan B, which came into existence in 1932, excuse me, in 1935, again, for general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=356)|
| 0:06:09| employees, referred to as Plan B. So those were the two pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Interestingly, at that time, the participants in those retirement plans were not covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| by Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| In 1962, there were revisions to the Charter, which established what we referred to as Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=385)|
| 0:06:36| A, and this was for, at that time, all employees of the City of Knoxville, both the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| and fire and the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| I think one of the, I can't say that I know all the impetus for that, but certainly one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| of the main reasons, I believe, for starting Plan A at that time was to cover all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=409)|
| 0:07:00| by Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| At 62, it actually came into effect in January of 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| At that time, with the new Plan A, as members came into that plan, they not only were participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| in the City of Knoxville Pension System Plan A, but also covered by Social Security at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| At that time, as you'll notice on there, those members of Plan F and Plan B, the old plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| were given the opportunity, if they so chose, to elect into Plan A and also to be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| by Social Security at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| I understand some folks did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| I think predominantly most folks did not do that, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| They remained in those old plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| Those plans, of course, are now closed when Plan A came in, so that in those two plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| the only members are retired members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| I guess, again, I should rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| There's actually one employee left in Plan B who actually works over at the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| and he worked here for so long that that was even before the library, which was, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| sure, the city library system, kind of got moved out a bit and operated as it does today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=485)|
| 0:08:14| That was in 1962, and then in 1997, actually, well, I should stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=494)|
| 0:08:23| In 1971, all employees were in Plan A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| In 1971, a new plan or a new benefit scheme was established, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| for the police and firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| We refer to that as Plan C, and again, when that was established in 1971, all new policemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=514)|
| 0:08:42| and firemen went into the plan, and again, there was an opportunity for the current policemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| and firemen who were in Plan A to transfer to Plan C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| And virtually everyone did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| The next important date, I guess, in the history here of the pension system was just in 1997| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| when the charter was amended to add a new plan for the general government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| referred to as Plan G, and at that time, again, all of the general government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| who were in Plan A had the opportunity to transfer into Plan G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| All employees who have been hired since January 1 of 97,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| the general government, do participate in Plan G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| So currently, those two plans, that is Plan G and Plan C, are the two open plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| where new employees participate, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| If they remained in the old plan, and as a matter of fact, there are, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| 12 active employees still in Plan A, and there are, in Plan C, in that transfer now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=589)|
| 0:09:59| there really aren't any active employees, excuse me, in the old, for those who stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| in Plan A, policemen and firemen, they have all now retired, so there's no active employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| in the uniform bodies in Plan A. So that quickly is just kind of a history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| of the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| So you just have, then, Plan A, C, and G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| Yes. Plan A has 12 active members, and again, it's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| Plan G and Plan C are the two plans where new employees are coming into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| And as I mentioned, Plan B does have this one active employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| Mr. Cherry, if you wouldn't mind, we've got about 1,600 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| How many are in Plan C and how many in Plan G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| There's about 800 firemen and police, I think, in round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| Yes. Actually, in your packet, in there, we do have a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| It should be probably, if it's, I think they're all in the same order, the very last page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| on the bottom should kind of address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| And I'll just run through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| I mentioned Plan A has 12, Plan B one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| In Plan G, and I won't go a lot into this, there are actually two different benefit schemes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| within Plan G, and you can see there that there are 494 employees currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| in that Option 1 and 276 in Option 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| So in the general government, a total of 783 active employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| And then specifically to your question, in the uniformed bodies, Plan C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| we have 277 active firefighters and 388 active police officers for a total of 665.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=695)|
| 0:11:43| Those are the individuals that are actually participating and contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| to the pension system as of today, as of the last payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| And any remaining police and fire are under those older plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| either retired or the 12 that are still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Yes, retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| There are really no active police and fire in either the old, really old Plan F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| and then the preceding Plan A that transferred into C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| And while we have this sheet, we also have listed there just the number of retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| as well too that we're paying in each one of those sections, retired general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=737)|
| 0:12:25| I will mention, I didn't have it in the remarks here, but I do want to mention too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| particularly for the new, there used to be an education section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| within the retirement system, I shouldn't say used to be, it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| However, that is a closed section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| You know, the old city of Knoxville schools, which were consolidated back in 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| And in that, so there are a number, as a matter of fact, most of our retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| that are being paid in terms of numbers are actually in the education section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| Again, it has been closed for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Actually, all those folks have basically retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| There are still approximately 30 some employees at now the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| that remained in Plan A. I guess that's important I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| When that consolidation occurred, all of the certified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| the teachers remained in the city's Plan A. And there's roughly 30 or so of those teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| that are still actively teaching and are active members of Plan A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Otherwise, they are all retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| I don't want to get into all that, but the benefits they receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| the city is responsible for the benefit that was accrued at the time of the consolidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| And then all of the benefits that accrued after that while they were county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| that's the responsibility of the county to pay those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Different governmental bodies put money into the pot based on their tenure in those plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Yes, yes, that would be correct, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Council Member Della Volpe, there are some, in terms, I think the numbers are slightly off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=844)|
| 0:14:13| There are some, probably more Plan C employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| What you have is you have some new, at least one new firefighter class that I know is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| that will be, hit the pension system in about five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| There is a six-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| They haven't quite vested or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| There is a six-month period, once you, enrollment period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| and you do not belong to the pension, enter the pension system until you've been here six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| So that piece is at least understated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| There's a new, well, police class, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| They're probably close to that six-month time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| They may be in or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| The other thing that's probably not reflected in those numbers are drop participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| We have some people that are currently on drop that probably will show as retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| even though they're currently on the city payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| So, and I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Drop out of the pension system, but still employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Well, again, the drop, drop plan, and I'm not the best one to explain this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| but you may retire once you reach the minimum retirement requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=919)|
| 0:15:29| and stay employed for a period of two years after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Your pension payments are put in an escrow at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| and once you leave the city payroll, then you will receive that, those pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| It stands for delayed retirement option plan or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| I may be slightly off on that acronym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| But, you know, again, we have close to 1,500 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| and I'd say, again, a little over 1,500 active ones right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| About half of those will be police and fire, and about half will be general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| So, again, that's kind of a good rough number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| I think he only had about 1,300, so I'm sure that there's some variations there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and I think it's in the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| As a dumb question, actuarially, are we young or old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| I mean, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Are we age 40 average, or are we like 59 and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| ready to jump into the system and get paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Well, I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I can tell you that currently, we have a fairly elderly population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=991)|
| 0:16:44| I guess you could speak, particularly in general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| It's a little bit younger in police, and fire is probably somewhere in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| The average general government employee is probably somewhere in the mid to upper 40s, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| Closer to the retirement than to the start point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Police, again, because we've had fairly decent retirements and so forth in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| and we've been putting on a new class every year, so it's pretty spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| There are a lot of fairly young police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| and then there's not very many in the middle, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| And then you have some older police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| It's not quite as much, I know when I started it, we referred to it as kind of a barbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| You didn't have anybody in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Now it's less of a barbell, but it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| And again, I would say that average fire is probably somewhere in the mid 30s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| maybe upper 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| We do have some figures in our actuarial report where in the fire, the average age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| now this was as of July 1st of last year, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| The firefighter, the average age was 40, and the average police officer's age was 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| General government, again, we have the two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| In option one, the average age was 44 for general government employee, and 52 in option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| And then there's a few folks, and there's only 12, but the average age for those is 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1099)|
| 0:18:38| Any other questions right at the moment on the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| OK, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| And again, as you're doing, please do ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| If I have comments, I want you to think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| This is certainly your session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| The pension board itself, and Bud has talked about that, was originally created in 1935,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| which is when, again, the general government plan B program was initially established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1142)|
| 0:19:10| That's when it was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| It's in charter section 1324.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| The current board and its composition, there were some revisions in July 1 of 99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| The Knoxville Utilities Board used to be an employer within this retirement system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| and they had asked for and were permitted to withdraw from the retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| They have their own retirement scheme now at the Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| That was effective on July 1, 1999, so the current board and the composition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| which Bud had covered in terms of who was on the board and how they came to be on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| Again, in your packet, we do just have a listing of who those current board members are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| and when their terms expire, again, just for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| When KUB left, did they take their chunk of the money and put it in their own system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| so that we don't have continuing obligations to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| When KUB left in the 90s, 99, did they take a chunk of money from the system and put it in theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| so we don't have to keep funding that pot like we do for teacher pots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Yes, that's exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| The fund was split up, and that money and all of those liabilities went to the Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| Went away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| We have no obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| The pension system no longer has any obligation for those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| And also, I mean, all the people that were retired and we were paying benefits to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| they were also, I mean, everyone was transferred to the Utilities Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| and they're responsible for paying those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1247)|
| 0:20:58| In the Pension Act in 62, this is when Plan A came into existence, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| there were certainly some powers and authority and the items in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| when the Pension Board was originally created in 35, that are listed in the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| but really in 62, in Section 1350.2, it talks about the administration of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| and the Pension Board was given the full authority to administer the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| And I've highlighted here just kind of the main items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| Once they have authority, certainly one would say, maybe with respect to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| of the system, but certainly the investment of the assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| of the pension system are probably the most important aspect of the Board's responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| The Charter requires them to develop an investment policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| and it's important to note that the Board does that, brings that to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| It's one of the items where we would be potentially in front of the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| If they want to make change to that, that those changes must be accepted and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| by the City Council in order for that policy to be altered in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| Mr. Chair, if you guys make a mistake in your investment policy, or the market doesn't cooperate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| and you end up more like California, who fills the pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| The City General Fund, or what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| The City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| The City, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Yes. Ultimately, the City is the sponsoring agency of the pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| and is certainly responsible for covering all of its liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| The Board is also empowered with making sure that the pension system is audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| which we do annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| They have the responsibility to, of course, keep all of the records, and to do reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| Actually, some of the reporting comes to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| We always have to put on file with the Recorder's Office our annual financial report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| and our annual actuarial evaluation is the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| I'll get to it in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| We also have been sending, hopefully you've all been receiving it each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| I just prepare a little summary of the activity for that month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| and in cumulative, the activity in the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| I'm just going to briefly talk about that in just a minute here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| as to the, you know, just kind of the finance of the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| during that particular fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I mentioned about the actuarial report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Certainly, the Board has the responsibility of, again, having an actuarial evaluation done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| looking at their liabilities, looking at the assets, the investment returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| and doing all of that fancy math an actuary does, and coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| Ultimately, the process there is to come back with the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| We'll send over to the city the required employer contributions that are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| in an upcoming budget year in order to fund the liabilities, and to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| as the value of these assets vary, that certainly has a direct effect on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| that request, the establishment of that employer contribution rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Section F, in that particular report, just simply provides protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| to the pension board members, clearly in the sense that they, having been empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| to contract with these advisors, and to seek their advice, assuming as they are in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| relying on that advice from those counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| They have legal protections in the decisions they make while on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| And also, I had mentioned this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| I mentioned about the social security coverage for members of the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| That was also in 62, that section there, that when plan A came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| that the pension board was responsible for making sure that all of the members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| they interfaced with the social security administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| and doing all of the modifications necessary, that all of those folks were, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| all of the employees were, in fact, covered by social security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| I want to jump down, you know, just very quickly, and I mean very quickly here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| about the benefit provisions on, I'm going to say the open plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Remember, that's plan C for the uniformed bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| and then plan G for the general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| And this is kind of the end result of, is all I'm going to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| In plan G for general government employees, what we refer to as normal retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| that is a full, unreduced benefit, there are one of two conditions that need to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| Either the individual is age 62, and then they can retire with a full, unreduced benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1563)|
| 0:26:11| or if the employee, at the time that they leave employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| meets what we refer to as the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| In other words, their age, and their years, and their service in the pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| when you add those two together, if they equal 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| then they also can retire with a full, unreduced benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| An employee who is age 55, hired into 30, has 25 years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| the 55 plus the 25 equals 80, they actually can go ahead and retire at 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| and receive a full, unreduced benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Prior to that coming into the plan, you simply had to be age 62 to get a full, unreduced benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| Someone with 25 years, in my example, could have retired, retired early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| but there was an extra step where we had a reduction in the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| It wasn't a full benefit at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| The formula itself has two variables in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| One is what we call the final average monthly salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| We look at, when they're about to retire, we'll look at their salary history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| and find the two 12-month periods, they do not have to be one consecutive 24-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| two 12-month periods where their compensation is the highest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| total that compensation up and divide by 24 to get what we call a final average monthly salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| That's one variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| The other, of course, is just the credited pension service they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| In the folder, again, I won't go through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| but we do have some examples of some calculations for Plan G Option 1, Plan G Option 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| and Plan C, just to give you an idea of how the formula works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| and at various salary levels and service, you know, what those benefits would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| Mr. Chair, excuse me, when you're figuring the two 12-month periods of compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| with the highest level of benefits, is that only salary, or is overtime counted as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| Overtime is not included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| The components of that are the regular biweekly pay, longevity, once employees get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| that gets rolled into the biweekly, so that employees are contributing on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and in any bonus that the employee receives, they would withhold contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| and that would also be counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Now, again, a bonus would only count if it was contained within one of the two 12-month periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| that was being used to do that calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| For most employees, quite frankly, it's the last 24 months of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| that we end up using to calculate the benefit, but it doesn't necessarily have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| If for some reason the salary were higher, and then they worked at a lower salary later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| we would go back and calculate the benefit on their highest compensation in those periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| Mr. Chair, some of us may not be as swift as others, and I'll go with the not swift for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| What are those percentages that you're showing in the options there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| Okay, when we talk about a retirement factor or a percentage, what we're talking about there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| and in option one, which is probably the most complicated there, has different percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| If the individual retires at age 62, and prior to being age 63,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| then we're going to use that 1.15% in the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Let me just run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| We take that final average monthly salary, and we're going to multiply it times the appropriate percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| the percentage being the age at the time of their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| If it's 62, it's 1.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| 63, it's 1.21, and so forth for 64 and 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| It's a percentage of their salary, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Yes, of the final average salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| We get a result once we multiply that percentage, and then we multiply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| Now, remember now, we're multiplying it times a final average monthly salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| and then we multiply that times their accredited service expressed as full years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| and then percentage of a partial year, and that's what results in the monthly benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| that's payable for life to that employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Did that get you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1839)|
| 0:30:48| Partly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Partly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I understand conceptually now where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| I'm looking at a chart that you've put in there, and I'm not sure that I've followed 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Let's just look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| I'm looking at plan G option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| It should be the first chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| That's where I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| In the group of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| If the average monthly salary is $1,250, and the individual is age 62 at the time of their retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| 1.15% times the $1,250 gives you the $14.38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| Is that an hourly rate, or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| That's just the benefit per year of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| This is a retirement benefit, not an hourly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| It's just a benefit per year of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| We simply take that times their years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| In this top example, we're looking at 25 years, which results in a benefit of $359.38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1894)|
| 0:31:42| Again, over to the right, that happens to be 28.75% of that $1,250, the $359.38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1902)|
| 0:31:57| Obviously, it's 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Same calculation, except we're using a higher factor in this plan G option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| If you flip over to option two, you'll see that, again, same procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| In this case, there isn't that tiered factor in there based on the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| It's just 2.1% is the multiplier or retirement factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| It shows the percentage of pay in the far right-hand column for all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| various average monthly salaries and those variable years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Obviously, the higher the salary and the longer you've been an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| the greater your benefit is going to be as a percentage of your pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| You mentioned 2.1%, but the multiplier on the example shows 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| I'm talking about plan G option two, the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Not C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Lastly, plan C, that was for the general government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| one of those two benefit schemes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| For plan C, the uniformed bodies, policeman, fireman, again, same procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| but yes, their factor is 2.5% for each year of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| Riskier job, bigger multiplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| I mentioned about age 62 and rule of 80 for general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| For the uniformed bodies, in order to retire with a full unreduced benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| they must be at least age 50 and have completed at least 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| Sounds like a rule of 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Well, not exactly the rule of 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| There is a minimum retirement age of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| You couldn't hire in and say at 48 with 27 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| which I suppose is mathematically possible since you can be a police or fireman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| I think at age 21, but you could not, so not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| You would still have a two-year of additional employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| before you could actually start drawing a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| I'm just curious, like for instance in option one, plan G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| how does that, say that first number at age 62, the $1,250 salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| how does that compare to Social Security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| In other words, there's a monthly retirement of $359.38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| $359.38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| How would that compare to Social Security?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Looking at the percentage of pay, that's 28.75% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| Again, this varies with Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Obviously, the higher you pay, the less your percentage of pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| that your benefit would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I think that would be fairly comparable to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| actually I think Social Security probably at that salary level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| the percentage of pay would be a little bit higher actually in that formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| which obviously front loads that calculation at the lower salaries a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| But a city employee gets both this and Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And they are independent of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| One does not affect the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| There's no offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| It is both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Mr. Cherry, the Social Security includes typically a cost of living multiplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| In our pension system, this monthly retirement benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| that we're seeing that's payable for life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| does that number stay the same as long as the retiree lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Actually, there are what they call post-retirement benefit adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| And for the employees, it is actually there is now a minimum increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| And this is effective January 1st of each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| There is a slight difference between general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| and the uniformed bodies in that in Plan G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| in the year that they retire, well, let me explain it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| In Plan C, a uniformed body, they have to be retired for at least 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| before they are eligible for that increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| So if they retire at any time other than January 1st of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| then that first January 1st, if they retire from February through December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| that first January 1st that follows their retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| they're not eligible at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| They don't get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| They have to actually wait a little bit longer than 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| In Plan G, that adjustment is for a partial year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| So if someone in Plan G retires on July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| they would get one half of the increase for that year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| since they had been retired for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| There's that slight wrinkle between the two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| The increase itself is established at a minimum of 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| A minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| So it's not tied, where Social Security is tied to the CPI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| this increase is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| The 3% every single year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| It's 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| No matter what the economy does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| And no matter how our earnings are doing in the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| in the pension fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Now then, for those retirees who are age 65 and older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| on January 1st, they also could get an additional increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| above that 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| The maximum would be an additional 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| They get one half of a CPI, which is over 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Simply put, if the CPI were 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| they get 3 plus half of the 1, 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| Obviously, if the CPI would be up to 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| then they would get 3 plus 1, 4, and it is capped at 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| And these are people over 65 who have retired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| As I say that, I think it's actually 62 now that I'm saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| where that changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| And that applies to both uniformed bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2265)|
| 0:37:54| and the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| And the 3% obviously compounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| So it's 3% on what you were getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| Yes, and it is compounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Is that written in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Is that something City Council looks at from year to year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| What if we have three bad years in a row and we're sucking wind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| Do we put money in at this rate, a minimum of 3%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| These adjustments are in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| In the charter itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| You need a charter amendment to actually adjust that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| if you had a financial crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| I'll let Bud speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Yes, I think there's even some question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| whether the benefits could or could not be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| But that's a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I didn't mean going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| I meant going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| In other words, the year's coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| and you're not realizing, say, growth in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| the way you had projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| And you're thinking, well, I can't be that generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| going forward for new increments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| because I don't have money in the kitty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| and I've got to cut something else out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Let me just pass it off to Mr. Gilbert here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I wasn't saying going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| We'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| For any member that has vested in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| which would be five years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| they are vested in their benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| and the cost of living adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| are a vested benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| And under Tennessee law...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| And under Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| in a long established line of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| the similar case being the Blackwell decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| that you often hear the pension lawyers mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| you cannot impair or diminish that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| There is some language in the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| This is an old Supreme Court decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| that many pension lawyers are talking about right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| because there's some language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| that the Supreme Court suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| that if there was ever an actuarial crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| you might be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| But heretofore, we've never had a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| who was allowed to diminish or impair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| those kind of benefits without...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| You just can't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| without paying them property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| So what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Go bankrupt at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| That topic has been on the minds of a lot of lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| as you will appreciate lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Yeah, there's some places around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| that have that problem of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| We're seeing nationally the topic of interest of late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| is some cities and states have gotten so generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| in their pension benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| with this decline that we had in 2007 and 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| in the markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| that they're finding themselves so unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| in their pension systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| that it's reverberating to the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| to have to appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| unprecedented amounts of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| to keep their system afloat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| And so these kinds of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| are being asked by a lot of lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| and pension people around the country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| You hope it turns around, but if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I mean, do you go down with the ship kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| That certainly is a question on the minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| We already have established in case law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| and other arenas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| that municipalities are entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| to bankruptcy protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| under the United States federal bankruptcy law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Would a city in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| avail itself of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| There is an issue in Tennessee case law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| as to whether the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| has given the authority to cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| and local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| to declare bankruptcy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| in a utility district case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| that's been around for about 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| You're not saying that lawyers would find issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| to litigate if that should come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I won't answer that, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Or attempt to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| Again, I would just refer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| not going into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| the board talking about their responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| and they have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| to contract with advisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| and to rely on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| I just put for your information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| the current listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| of who those advisors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| The first page shows all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| actual money managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| those investment firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| that are making the investment decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| on the pension fund itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| And then on the second page at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| we list currently our actuary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| attorney, investment consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| our custodian, the auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| and the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| State Street Bank actually serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| as both our custodian and trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| You don't have any credit default swaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| or anything like that, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I'm not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| You're not aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| although I say that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| And our bond fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| I don't want to say that that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| it could possibly be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| I'm not familiar with any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Jim, do you wish to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I'm not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| I'm asking, are we fairly conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| in our investments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| That's the general question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Yes, I would say so, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Yes, that policy certainly has got some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| I think, some pretty tight restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| I'm not aware of any swaps in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Or obligations, CDOs, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| And if I could add one additional comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I didn't want to leave you with the impression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| which sometimes we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| on that earlier discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| about your inability to take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| a vested benefit in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| However, that does not mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| that you could not change the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| going forward for those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| that are not vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Certainly the ones that have five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| they're entitled to that benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| but sometimes we lose sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| that if we think the system is out of balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| and we're awarding too generous of benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| we shouldn't necessarily bury our heads in the sand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| because you can't affect the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| for the employees of tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| who come on with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| By changing the charter, in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| That would be a charter change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Unlike most governmental systems in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| and I'm not going to say this is good or bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| because everyone would have an opinion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| our pension system, the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| the actual words of the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| are written into the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| That has certain advantages to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and certain disadvantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| If you look at our county counterpart, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| their charter just merely states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| that the county government is entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| to have a pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| and the legislative body for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| would adopt the words of that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| that would be presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Because of decisions made long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| starting back in 1935,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| the city fathers and mothers and the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| put the actual plan document in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| So you might ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| what is one of the disadvantages to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| We're proud to say for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| in the pension board's history of many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| we actually have a qualified plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| a plan that we've submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| to the Internal Revenue Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| and actually received a qualification letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| saying that it meets all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| of the Internal Revenue Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| We only obtained that status in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I think it was 2002?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| I think around then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| I would say it was 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| It may have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| We'd gone twice to the Internal Revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| for that letter that gives us our credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| One concern that we have always had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| but we think we've fixed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| is what would happen if you ever went to the IRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| for your qualification letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| or Congress passed a new law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| that we couldn't get changed with the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| because the voters, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| they just voted it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| And then it would risk the qualified status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| of our entire employee retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| City Council wisely adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| several years back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| at the recommendation of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| and it was approved by the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| what we call an SPP provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| It stands for Supplemental Plan Provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| And it's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| There's actually a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| for each of the major plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Plan A, Plan C, and Plan G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| 1360.10 would be an example of one of those sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| I'm sorry, that's the contribution rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Let me find it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I made a note on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| It's in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Oh, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| 1350.12 or 1371.6 would be the Plan G provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| It allows City Council a very limited ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| to affect a plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| could even be diminishing of benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| if it is required to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| the qualified status of the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| with the Internal Revenue Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Under that circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| and that circumstance alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| and by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| it has to be initiated by the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| It cannot be initiated by Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| But if initiated by the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| at the recommendation of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| City Council can actually adopt an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| And if you wanted to see our plan document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| it basically would immediately point you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Article 13 of the City of Knoxville Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| It's all of Article 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| And then there's a rather comprehensive ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| that was passed by City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| I think the last one in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| that we call it our Supplemental Plan provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| And it's got all that nitty-gritty stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| that the Internal Revenue Service requires you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| in your plan document today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| which the City voters would probably never understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| if we took it to referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| It certainly would take a lot of pages of print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| in the Knoxville News Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| to print the referendum ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| It has all of our actuarial tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| all the kinds of things the IRS requires you now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| to have stated in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| You were saying that for a qualified plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| does it have advantages to the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| or is it to the workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| An immense advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| because a qualified plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| you must be qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| in order for your contributions to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| not to be taxed to the individual employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| If we ever lost our qualified status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| if it's not qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| you're not entitled to the corresponding deductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| under the Internal Revenue Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| or the exclusions from income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| So, you know, I know I get scared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| and Mr. Chair gets scared about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| perhaps City Council doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| but when you see us concerned about a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| that could blow the qualification of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| it has immense consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| to all of our members and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Because if they pay taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| they have less to retire on or live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| It means that all of the contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| that they put into the system over all those years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| should have been taxable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| and they've been getting tax deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Can they reach back and claw back that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| The government can reach back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| and claw back the taxes due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Yes, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Now, have they ever done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| in the history of the Internal Revenue Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| with a disqualified plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Usually everyone goes to immense and extraordinary measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| to get the plan qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| because the consequence is so dire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| to the members that are affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| that it's one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| nobody really likes to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| So, you know, we just do our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| to maintain qualified status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| and because, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| in your private plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| the IRS, I'm sorry, Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| continues to change all these rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| all the time on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| We're always going through a cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| We're in a five-year cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| of seeing what new changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| we have to adopt into our pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| to keep our qualified status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| and, indeed, we'll probably be coming to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| in the next two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| with a substantial amendment to the SPP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| that will be very technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| gritty stuff that nobody will understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| and we'll be sitting here telling you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| believe us, we've got to have it in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| or we could lose our qualified status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Now, how could that affect you in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| There have been proposals of late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| and Mr. Cherry could speak more eloquently to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| by the Internal Revenue Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| to propose rather radical ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| such as they were kicking around a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| a year ago that they didn't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| as a matter of policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| that anyone in a qualified plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| should be able to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| before the age of 50 or 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| If they ever do anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| that will obviously have a dire effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| on our pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| because we will be telling current employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| who have a vested benefit under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| that now the Internal Revenue Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| says you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| And what happens when the IRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| starts proposing that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| is you hear from people all around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| saying you're going to cause us immense problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| so we hope if they ever get around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| to doing something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| they'll make that change perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| and not apply to existing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| who are vested or otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| we've got a big problem in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| and in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| with the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| So far we've dodged all those bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| They haven't done anything quite to us like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| But we hear rumors all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| that they're going to be more active in that arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| with governmental plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Mr. Cherry, I'm sorry if I missed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| or I should remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Did you explain the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| between Plan G, Option 1 and Option 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Again, they're two separate benefit schemes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| All new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| and let me just insert this here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| of which you new members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| will be new employees in the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| You'll become members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| and begin making employee contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| And again, those contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| are set at 6%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| of the regular bi-weekly pay that you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| So all new employees are in Plan G, Option 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Option 1 has two components to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| We've described here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| the defined benefit portion, this formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| and what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Also, and this is just in Option 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| for general government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| there's something we refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| as the Supplemental Retirement Account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| It's an additional account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| for those employees in Option 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| when we receive the 6% employee contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| We allocate 3% to this defined benefit piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| and 3% to this Supplemental Retirement Account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| In addition, the city is contributing again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| on a bi-weekly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| 1.5% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| That money also flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| into that Supplemental Retirement Account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| So that at retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| someone works and is eligible to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| has met the normal retirement provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| they're going to get this defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| We run through the formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| do the calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| and come up with their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| In addition, in this option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| they have this account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| which over those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| where they've contributed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| the employers contributed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| and hopefully there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| an accumulation of investment return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| And the investment return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| that goes into those accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| is allocated to those accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| The employees cannot direct these investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| That's all done for the fund as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Once we have determined each calendar quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| what that investment return is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| either positive or negative, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| then we allocate down into their accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| their pro-rata share of those returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| So over time, that account again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| hopefully, and there are quarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| as you can well imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| where in fact the return for that quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| is a negative return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| and that gets allocated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Over an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| obviously the net return should be a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| And at retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| then they have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| to the value of that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| They can either take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| just in a lump sum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| which we can pay to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| They do have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| on that particular part of the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| If they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| they can choose to roll that over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| In other words, kind of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| what the tax implications are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| at the time they retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| as far as receiving that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Or they do have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| to simply annuitize that account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| just like an insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| We have in the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| that Bud had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| we have factors that we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| based on our expected return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| and mortality tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| that $50,000 buys you another $105 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| for the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| So it becomes a defined benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| by annuitizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| For those that choose to annuitize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| yes, then their benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| is the defined benefit result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| plus whatever they've purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Again, just a very minor point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| but so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| on this piece that's annuitized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| we talked about cost of livings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| The cost of living would not be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| to that annuitized portion of the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| Just to the defined benefit piece, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3330)|
| 0:55:40| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| It's so simple, it just flows, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| And this is just really a general overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| of the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| There's a whole lot more under the hood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| than just this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| We're not here to try to make you experts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| So Mr. Terry, then in Plan G Option 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| that's not open any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Okay, no, Plan G Option 2 is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Excuse me, yes, to continue that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| So all new employees are in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| One of the important points in the retirement system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| for an employee who remains for 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| they have the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| but actually they must make a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| They have to decide whether to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| in this Plan G Option 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| or transfer over to Option 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Now, as you noticed in the chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| the retirement factor in Option 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| which is 2.1%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| is a considerably greater factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| than in Option 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| even at age 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| which is a maximum of 1.35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| So obviously that would result in that calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| being a much higher defined benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| in Option 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Say they have to choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| why would they choose not to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| Well, basically the choice comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| if they believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| and quite frankly I would say it's a factor of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| might be the most important point in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Obviously an account that's having money going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| and is invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| with the rule of compounding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| the longer that it's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| and the longer it's compounded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| that value would get greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| I guess the underlying theory behind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| if you were younger and wanted to stay in G1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| there's enough time that that account balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| would grow to an extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| that when you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| I'll get into present values now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| the value of that defined benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| plus the value of that account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| actually exceeds the present value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| of the higher defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| So if someone elects to transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| then in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| that account that's been there for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| simply gets closed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| And now then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| their benefit is strictly in accordance with the formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| with the higher retirement factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| Closed out even the supplemental portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| or is that different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| They lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| They forfeit that over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| They forfeit the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Yes, that account gets closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| They're giving up that account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| in return for a higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| what you would call guaranteed or defined benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| if they choose to switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| So it's just a question of whether that account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| in their view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| is going to have enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| or depending upon investment returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| grow to such an extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| that the lower benefit plus the account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| would ultimately be worth more to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| than just a higher lifetime monthly benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| I suppose for some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| there may be a preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| that if they can get part of their benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| in a lump sum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| as opposed to a lifetime monthly benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| that might be another reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| that someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| irrespective of the financial values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| would decide to stay in option one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| There is no lump sum in option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| There is no lump sum in option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| And on the defined benefit piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| an employee at retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| there is no option to just cash that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| It is only payable in lifetime monthly installments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| While we're talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| I would say when an employee reaches that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| there are various alternate retirement options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| since I've mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Those options are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| which enables the employee, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| to provide some protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| in the case of someone who's married to their spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| or to their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| really whomever they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| If they choose one of those options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| then we're looking again at actuarial factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| where if the normal retirement benefit is $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| and they want to provide benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| to someone after their death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| then we'll look at their age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| the beneficiary's age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| come up with a factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| and actually reduce their benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| kind of like a premium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| for that second payee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| to continue to receive benefits for their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| I quipped before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| will this be an open book test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| My question, I guess, really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| for an employee who's facing this juncture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| is there someone he goes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| and gets some advice as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| here's what the scenario looks like this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| versus this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Because it is a little bit complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| even if you had it in a booklet form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| to understand this, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| At the pension office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| one of the things we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| we do prepare a projection under each of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| to age 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| And for those who are going to reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| the rule of 80 before 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| what would be their most likely retirement dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| we do do a projection on each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Obviously, the really important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| on that supplemental retirement account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| we have to make assumptions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| We do assume a basic salary increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| that's in the charter, 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| But they get a snapshot of what it might look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| and they can choose an option at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| And we certainly try to tell them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| the investment return we're using is such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| but that doesn't make it so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| So it is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| We obviously advise them, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| to check a financial advisor too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| if they so wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| But we do try to give them some numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| that would enable them to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| somewhat of an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| I'll just again reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| this is the document where it shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| there are two pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| they actually cover the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| In the back of what you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| is for the month of March of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| It just shows what the fund balance was on March 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| $415.5 million at the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| It shows the activity for the month of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| In this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| you can see in the upper right corner there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| we talk about our realized investment earnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| the unrealized change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| just the market value changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| And then, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| the employee and employer contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| that have made during March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| All of those, same format on the front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| This is simply accumulating it on the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| from July, in this case July 1 of 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| up through March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| And hopefully you've been getting this each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| and looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| I would certainly offer to any of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| if you see something on there you have a question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| or we've tried to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| obviously we list all of our current money managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| the amount of assets that each manager has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| and again, what they've done in that particular month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| and year to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| At the bottom we have some kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| somewhat summary of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| some detail, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| about also how the money is being spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| on the professional advisors particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| As a matter of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| what would you say the city's portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| of contribution has averaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| over the last two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| on an annual basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| This is a one month snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| What kind of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| maybe that's a Jim York question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| what kind of dollars are we putting into the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| regardless of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| not by plan or sub-plan options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| but just as a lump sum kind of round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| obviously not accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| but round ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| I want to say somewhere around nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| between nine and ten million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| but I could be off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Yeah, that's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| That's the number we would compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| to the net budget of about $250 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3849)|
| 1:04:18| Mr. Cherry, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Please don't hesitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Mr. Gilbert, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Supposedly we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| That will be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| So does council have any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| Well, I guess I'll ask one because I can't resist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| Oh, don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| How do you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| I mean, we've been in this situation where there was several years of growth in the marketplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| and then you see this terrible nosedive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| and then you see us crawling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Where do you see us in the short run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| because that's all anyone can guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| in terms of our pension fiscal soundness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Looking forward this year or this year and the next kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Certainly, again, looking at the short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| as you look at the numbers here in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| since July 1 of 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| we've had already a rather remarkable recovery in the financial markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3911)|
| 1:05:19| which has certainly given us a great sense of relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| Where am I looking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| The pension system, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| What part of this two-page, the front page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| The front page of this, just in the upper left-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| you can see in July 1 of 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| we had $375 million in assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| That has now climbed to $427 million just in that nine-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| And that reflects what's been happening in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Almost a $52 million increase in the value of our assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| What was its peak before the crash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Before the crash, the absolute peak, which was in the mid-2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| was at around $550 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| But we haven't gotten back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| We've got a ways to go, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3963)|
| 1:06:12| But it looks better than it did last year, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| That concludes my question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| We want to thank you folks very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| I think for us, especially us new council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| it's a lot of numbers to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| And I'm sure that we'll be talking to you as we get into the program also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Are there any proposals coming before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| Are we just looking at this as a knowledge thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| In other words, are you sending a package up to us to say we're about to change all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| If we can, and we certainly don't want to keep you beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| but I'll just address how these changes and proposals come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| We do have a procedure now in place, which we are thankful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Yes, it's a rather recent change to the charter, Charter Section 1355.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| We call it a charter protection measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| but it requires any proposal that affects the city of Knoxville pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| to be submitted first to the pension board 60 days before its first reading approval by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| And when we get that proposal, we have to review it, study it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| and then render a written report to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| so that you will be well informed of what it does and what its cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| Because you can only amend the city charter every general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| which is essentially twice in the even years, in August and November of the even years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| we have a schedule so we know when all those deadlines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| and we can report to you that at least for the August 2010 referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| there are no proposed changes to the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| The deadline for the November 2010 referendum, I think, is coming up in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| And if we receive no proposals, you won't hear anything from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| If we do receive a proposal, we are required under the charter to notify you of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| and then follow through with our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| But the point is that you'll get 60 days to do an evaluation to advise us about what is before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| before we actually leap into the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| This is a much improved system over the way it used to be in the old days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| because we used to hear about it sometimes at city council the night that you had to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| We need one of those really quick little calculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| Mr. Gilbert, the charter protection proposal that you just talked about, that's currently in force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| Yes. Remember Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| it first was, I think it was received so well as a good idea that you first enacted it as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| But then we followed it up with a charter amendment that has been approved by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| So it is section 1355 of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| And this is any change that who might suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4148)|

| 1:09:20| So any change that might be suggested to the pension system must be submitted to the pension board 60 days prior to its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| reading on first approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100415?start=4167)|
