| 0:00:00| Okay, good evening everyone. Thank you so much for being here. We've got a full house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=0)|
| 0:00:12| and we will get to business here. We're going to start though. I'll call this meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| order. This is the special meeting, special called meeting of Knoxville City Council for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| Thursday, April 9, 2015. And we will start with an invocation that will be given by Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=22)|
| 0:00:30| George Wallace and the Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Councilman Marshall Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| Please rise. God, may the emergence of the landscape cause us to pause and reflect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=36)|
| 0:00:45| give thanks. May this natural beauty remind us of fresh starts and second chances and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| a hope that only you can offer. Let us not forget those less fortunate. Inspire us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| seek ways to comfort and care for those that are our neighbors. We pray for wisdom tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| for the issues that are before us that we would be fair and transparent and we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| reach an equitable solution for all. Amen. Please place the flag. I pledge allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=70)|
| 0:01:17| to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=83)|
| 0:01:31| Call the roll Ms. Mitchell. Councilman Brown. Here. Councilman Campin. Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| Dela Volpe. Here. Councilman Grieve. Here. Councilwoman Palmer. Here. Vice Mayor Pablos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| Here. Councilman Saunders. Here. Councilman Stair. Here. Councilman Wallace. We are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| here tonight. Okay, so what Council has agreed to do is to first hear public comment before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| Council gets into debating and discussing the different sections and details of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| ordinance. And we've got Council's sign-up sheet here. We've got actually four names that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| have signed up for those who are for the ordinance. And you can have up to three. So I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=129)|
| 0:02:18| to say the four names and you all have to decide which three will be doing it, which will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| presenting. We have Susan Williams, Jim Rooney, George Ewart, and Jill Thompson. So do you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| know which? Is George here? I heard that George might not be here yet. So we'll take those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=151)|
| 0:02:39| three? Okay, so it will be Susan Williams, then Jim Rooney, then Jill Thompson. And then for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| those against, Marcia Grieve, Trevetta Johnson, and Jerry Erpenbach. So by Council rules, each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| person will come up. Please state your name and address for the record. And I'll set the timer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| and you have up to five minutes. And we do appreciate each of you being here. So we'll start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| with, oh, I'm sorry, yes. Go ahead, we'll read this into the record. An ordinance to amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| Knoxville City Code, Appendix B, zoning regulations, definitions, and sign regulations. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| Ms. Mitchell. Okay, we'll start with Susan Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=195)|
| 0:03:28| And I'll give you all a warning when you're about a minute out. I don't think I'm going to take my five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=208)|
| 0:03:36| minutes. You'll be surprised sometimes. My name is Susan Williams. My address is 9000 Legends Lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee. I am here tonight representing the Chamber of Commerce. I chair the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| Government Relations and Public Policy Committee. And we have taken a unanimous vote in support of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=231)|
| 0:04:00| proposal that is before you tonight. Our chamber represents 2200 businesses, about 80% of which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=240)|
| 0:04:11| small. We have about 50,000 employees in those 2200 businesses. And we have a number of small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| businesses. And their success is dependent in a great part on having signage to advertise their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=260)|
| 0:04:30| The business community is here tonight. We have a lot of folks here. I appreciate their being here. I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| you to stand up if you are here representing the business community in the chamber, please. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| thank you. Appreciate it. I think where we are on this as far as the chamber goes is we really feel like you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=283)|
| 0:04:59| have done a terrific job in bringing together sort of the disparate groups in the community to study this signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| ordinance. You've worked three years, which is a phenomenon. And I know you've met 50-something times and had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=306)|
| 0:05:18| public input, both from the scenic Knoxville side and from business as well. And we really feel that the work that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| task force has done has been important. And there's been a lot of back and forth and input from everyone. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=325)|
| 0:05:40| that it would be important for you all to pass this because, frankly, you've had three years of input. We'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| it passed as is. There's no one that probably will come before you tonight that appreciates the aesthetics of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=347)|
| 0:05:58| any more than I do. I'm one of those green Republicans, as most of you know. And I really feel like we have a beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=358)|
| 0:06:09| community. Look outside this week. It's probably, I think, the prettiest city in America. It's a beautiful city. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| think it's the prettiest city in America in April. So we appreciate aesthetics. And it's not that we don't want that in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| community. We do. But we also think you have to balance that with the business interest and with these small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| particularly who depend on the signage to get people to their business. Dwayne's leadership on this task force has just been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| exemplary. We think the business community's input brought about a reduction in signs. I know that's something that's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=398)|
| 0:06:52| all of you from 50 feet to 30 feet, which is a 40% reduction. So that was a compromise the business community in the chamber was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| willing to accept. I think we're here asking you to honor the many hours that this task force has given to this issue and allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=419)|
| 0:07:13| them to move forward with this and really try and keep it intact. I think if you open this up and begin to add, try to add a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| amendments, it will probably undo the three years of work that this task force has done. So thank you for letting the chamber be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=440)|
| 0:07:36| heard. Again, on behalf of 2,200 businesses and 50,000 employees, we ask that you in fact pass the ordinance as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Thank you, Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=462)|
| 0:07:56| Mr. Rooney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Thank you. Thank you for having me. My name is Jim Rooney. I'm a local business owner here in Knoxville, Tennessee in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| greater Knoxville market. I own six businesses and I'm here to represent the business owners and just say a couple of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| Your address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| 310 Simmons Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922. It's a difficult challenge running a small business and I appreciate the work that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| committee has put forth in exploring all the options and the alternatives available to signage. I moved here 20 years ago and fell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| in love with this community, decided to raise my family here, invest my life and my savings here, and it's a wonderful place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| We've decided to keep our business footprint and our growth within the immediate Knoxville market. The city of Knoxville has two of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=525)|
| 0:08:55| our locations and we plan to expand in the future, but we want to stay in this greater market and invest and improve our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| improve the offerings that we offer to the public. We want you to vote yes. We know it's a very big challenge ahead of you, reducing sign height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=542)|
| 0:09:12| square footage on graphics and banners. We know it's a challenge and I too, in support of the previous speaker, I too am concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| aesthetics and the appearance of our community. As I travel around the country and I share my business practices with other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| owners and we meet and we discuss what it's like to live and work and run a business in Knoxville, Tennessee, I find a lot of people that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=567)|
| 0:09:37| love to be in this community with me and operate small businesses. So I find it a pleasure to be here and the impact that we can have on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=577)|
| 0:09:47| community and the support we get from the local community and the government is critical to our success. I'm just here in favor of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| these business owners that are represented in the crowd tonight and I'm asking you to vote yes for the proposal as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=594)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you for being here. Thank you for having us. I'm Jill Thompson, address is 7520 Hollycrest Lane, Knoxville 37938. I'm the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=618)|
| 0:10:33| director of the Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association, representing the hospitality and tourism community. We represent hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| restaurants, those people that invite people to come and visit us and stay a while, spend their money and go back home. So our businesses help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=640)|
| 0:11:01| provide a tax relief, basically, for the individuals in our community. I mean, because of state and local taxes that we have to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=661)|
| 0:11:09| these visitors' pay, our households, the individual households in Knox County would pay $349 more in taxes if it wasn't for the tourists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=669)|
| 0:11:20| that we bring to Knoxville. So signage is very important to us to get the individuals off the highways, to get the individuals into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=680)|
| 0:11:31| restaurants, into our hotels. I was privileged to be able to sit through many of the meetings and get to know the individuals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| get to know the business community. And I truly respect the time and the energy and the input that they allow the community and the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=699)|
| 0:11:53| community to give. And I feel that they have weighed every possible aspect of this sign ordinance. Is it perfect? No. I don't think it will ever be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| perfect. But it's a compromise and it's an absolute compromise. And the three years that they've spent doing that, we feel that it's something that we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=720)|
| 0:12:13| can live with and we appreciate their time and we're asking that the council members vote yes in the entirety of this sign ordinance that they've spent so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| many times and we respect their work. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=739)|
| 0:12:30| Thank you, Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| We'll hear from Marcia Greve, Trevetta Johnson and Jerry Erpenbach. So Ms. Greve? Or who's going first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=758)|
| 0:12:50| Hi, I'm Trevetta Johnson. Thank you for being here. Thank you for having me. I live at 1640 Jefferson Avenue, Knoxville, 37917. I'm here on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=770)|
| 0:13:00| Neighborhood Advisory Council known as NAC. The NAC consists of neighborhood leaders from across the city appointed by the mayor who meet monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=780)|
| 0:13:10| and serve in an advisory and partnership capacity giving advice and feedback to the Office of Neighborhoods and bringing neighborhood issues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| concerns to the attention of city administration. This past fall, the NAC reviewed the MPC amendments to the City of Knoxville zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=797)|
| 0:13:26| definitions and sign regulations document and listened to members from the sign ordinance task force at two different meetings. With all due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=806)|
| 0:13:35| respect to the work that sign task force has done, we did not feel that their proposal calls for nearly enough change in the existing regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| We viewed examples that indicated there is not a direct link between excessive sign height and business activity. Subsequently, the NAC voted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=822)|
| 0:13:55| endorse scenic Knoxville's proposal for maximum sign height and area. The vote was 11 in favor with two abstaining due to insufficient knowledge on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| the subject. But as a note, with further study, the vote has since been revised to 12 in favor with one abstaining. While we certainly respect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=842)|
| 0:14:14| business interest to have greater visibility, our primary concern is for the residents who live and drive in Knoxville. We urge the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=854)|
| 0:14:24| to consider what other progressive minded cities across the region are doing in regard to sign ordinances and sign regulations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| to imagine what we want Knoxville to look like 10 to 20 years from now in terms of beautification, lack of visual clutter and overall aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=872)|
| 0:14:41| We respectfully hope that those with business interests will support and value the greater common good of beautification and a pleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| aesthetic for our city over excessive visibility for their own economic interests. We feel residents and visitors are actually more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| to support businesses that demonstrate care for their neighbors through less obtrusive, tasteful signage. For sake of the residents of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=896)|
| 0:15:06| Knoxville and the overall beautification of our city, we strongly urge the City Council to adopt scenic Knoxville's proposal for sign height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| and area. And also on a personal note, I just want to say that the city that I grew up in adopted a very courageous and visionary stand on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| this about 25 years ago. It was very controversial, but it is now such an aesthetically pleasing city to visit with beautiful sunsets and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=922)|
| 0:15:36| sunrises and I would just hope the same could happen here in Knoxville. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you. Jerry Erpenbach. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=942)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you very much for having me. I am Jerry Erpenbach. I live at 9621 Coatsworth Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922. This is a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| blocks west of Cedar Springs Church on the Kingston Pike. My back fence line is the city line, so you and the city have control of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=965)|
| 0:16:16| commercial growth and the signage where we live. My parents moved to a new residential area of Kingston Pike in Cedar Springs in 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=976)|
| 0:16:25| My wife and I moved to the area 30 years later in 1984, so I have witnessed tremendous change in this beautiful area of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| Over 30 years with other homeowners in the area, I have been actively trying to facilitate and balance the commercial responsible growth that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=992)|
| 0:16:40| literally taking place on the city-annexed land a stone's throw from my backyard. When it comes to signage, there is no real city-county line in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| what we, our families, and our visitors see in the community. There is no real city-county line for many of the hundreds of thousands of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| tourists that come to and through our area. In 1996, MPC and City Council undid the sector plan and the zoning in the area to allow the huge CBL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1016)|
| 0:17:07| developers of Atlanta to build Kingston Overlook, a small three-business strip mall adjacent to my property. When it came to signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| fortunately CBL had already recognized that low attractive signs, similar to what had been done down the street at Franklin Square, was good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| business. We told CBL we did not want, nor did we need, tall pole signs to find their business, and they listened. As changes in growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1042)|
| 0:17:31| continued up and down Kingston Pike in the Cedar Springs area, we as homeowners had to take it upon ourselves to monitor every development and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| on review to ensure that the signage norms established at Kingston Overlook and Franklin Square were recognized and protected. The large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1059)|

| 0:21:17| as an individual, as a member of scenic Knoxville, but I'm only going to be referring to some of scenic Knoxville's recommendations. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| thinking what I was going to say, I realized that City Council is faced with a historic opportunity to set policy that could have a far-reaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1284)|
| 0:21:34| positive impact in Knoxville for many years to come. I'm only going to address two issues which I think are of the highest priority. Number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1294)|
| 0:21:43| one, height maximums allowed for on-premise business signs on commercial streets. I did a little research recently and was amazed to discover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1303)|
| 0:21:53| that Knoxville has had a 45-foot sign height maximum since 1977, with an increase to 50 feet in 1982. Essentially, almost 40 years of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1313)|
| 0:22:06| tall signs 45 feet or higher. And then it hit me. No wonder we have the cluttered, unsightly amount of signage that we have today. Then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| started to think back to one of the main reasons the city decided to study and revise the sign ordinance in the first place. Most of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1332)|
| 0:22:25| remember the uphill struggle we had with Chick-fil-A in Bearden in 2012. The 50-foot sign they planned to erect in front of their one-story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1345)|
| 0:22:35| building would be easily visible from surrounding neighborhoods. Fortunately for us, they relented after a year of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| heavy community protest. But in an almost identical situation in Fountain City, they disregarded the community's pleas and erected a 30-to-40-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1362)|
| 0:22:53| sign on a 12-foot buildup to compete with McDonald's across the street. My point? Unless your city has guidelines for lower signage, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1373)|
| 0:23:05| businesses will opt for the maximum sign height allowed, no matter how it affects nearby residents. And that's why I'm here today to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| talk to you about the importance of signage in residential communities. So, in retrospect, I'm actually thankful that these incidents took place. It was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| first time that I and many others found out that this particular sign regulation was in force in Knoxville. This gave many people in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1401)|
| 0:23:30| community their first awareness of how needed it was to get sign ordinance revision and hopefully get a more reasonable sign height limit enacted. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| think I can speak for many average citizens like myself who, before now, did not realize they could actually do something about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1417)|
| 0:23:50| Luckily for East Tennessee, there are communities who have done something to better regulate their signage, and many of them are in our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| backyard. Merrillville, Chattanooga, Morristown, Sevierville, among others. Some of these communities do not have signage in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1438)|
| 0:24:07| backyard. In fact, some communities actually reduced their sign heights to 20 or 25 feet in the late 80s and 90s. And it surprised me to find out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| Knoxville is actually way behind in this area. What a dichotomy. Other communities want to emulate us and have watched what a thriving city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1455)|
| 0:24:26| Knoxville has become. Downtown revitalization, historic preservation, greenways, riverfront development, and on and on. And yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1466)|
| 0:24:37| it is obvious that we are way behind in having reasonable sign heights that do not detract from the natural beauty all around us. So, what do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1477)|
| 0:24:48| citizens want? You have heard from at least 250 people, most of whom are supporting scenic Knoxville's recommendations. At the very least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1488)|
| 0:24:59| people are asking for a 20-foot or lower height maximum. The 30-foot maximum that the sign task force has set for the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| Knoxville, as the task force recommends, will not have much of a noticeable impact on sign clutter since many of our signs are already at 30 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| 40 feet. Scenic Knoxville recommends monument signs only, which I think is much preferable. But any ground signage that is 20 feet or lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1514)|
| 0:25:25| would make a significant difference in the look of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| My second highest priority is please give us a legal framework to deal with existing or non-conforming signs so that over time, older signs can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1531)|
| 0:25:44| come into conformance with new regulations. Many cities are already doing this, and I won't go into all the things that they do. And one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| last thing I wanted to say is I want to emphasize to business owners that I'm not, scenic Knoxville is not, and citizens are not against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| businesses wanting to be successful. However, we firmly believe that a more attractive community is what ultimately is the best driver of economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| prosperity. Okay, please listen to your citizens. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| Okay, so just so everybody knows the process we're going to be using for this meeting, the ordinance that we're going to be using is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| ordinance that is before council as part of the packet. We will be working through, I think there are 15 sections that are part of this ordinance, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1589)|
| 0:26:39| with the assistance of Krista Cuccaro in our law department and Rob Frost, who is the council's attorney, we will be working through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1599)|
| 0:26:51| Now, ultimately, we anticipate that there will be a motion at the end to send this ordinance at the end of the meeting, and that motion will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| sent as amended, if it is amended, to MPC for their review. MPC will then review it, and then it will come back to city council at a future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1619)|
| 0:27:09| meeting on first reading, at which point they will then deliberate and vote, and then again require a second reading. So just that you, so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1629)|
| 0:27:18| know that votes today are not final decisions. This is the review section by section. We'll see if there are any amendments that council wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1638)|
| 0:27:29| do, then anticipate a motion to send it as amended to MPC. Council, is that your understanding as well, just so we're all on the same page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1649)|
| 0:27:40| Okay. So before we get started, I want to call on the chair of the task force, Duane Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| Thank you, Mayor. I want to speak, I want to say a few words as chair of the assigned task force, and I'm not going to go into great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| detail of the work that the assigned task force has completed over the last three and a half years. This has been addressed in previous council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| meetings and also in our workshop. But I want to talk about process and the process that we went through. As council knows, we appointed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| group of citizens to review, revise, and develop a new signed ordinance. It is my hope that this council will respect the work that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| accomplished by those volunteer citizens and pay attention to their deliberations and move the ordinance forward. Is this the final ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1697)|
| 0:28:28| This is and will continue to be a work in progress, as most ordinances are, and especially with the rapid changes in communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| technologies, I'm sure we're going to see changes over the next couple of years. Is what is before you perfect? No. However, what is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| to you is updated, it's more complete, it's better organized, it's easier to enforce, it's better for the people to understand, and better for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1722)|
| 0:28:54| city and our future. It has been developed by MPC director, it's been vetted by the MPC, by the MPC staff, it's been reviewed by MPC, it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| vetted by the city law department, and it's been revised, dissected, and reworked by the signed task force. The ordinance represents a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1740)|
| 0:29:14| compromise to many of the issues at hand and by those involved in the process. I urge you to pass the proposed ordinance with possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| amendments, consider where we were and where we are today. Let's continue this process and send it to MPC after our deliberations today. If you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1761)|
| 0:29:34| read the 37 pages of the document, you'll see that there are over a hundred of items that we dealt with over the last three years. We know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1774)|
| 0:29:43| there are specific items that are contentious. Sign heights, scenic highway signs, window signs, abandoned houses, and other items that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| important to the city. We also know that there are significant items that are related to the maintenance of abandoned signs, maintenance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| existing signs, and enforcement. And these are possible items for us to discuss and make amendments on this evening. The law department is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| working with various issues that have been brought to their attention over the last couple of weeks. There are opportunities for continued compromise to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| be made. And when this comes back to council in June for two readings. We also know that we have passionate constituents from both sides that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1812)|
| 0:30:21| differ. In some cases, even under one roof. So I want to be clear that the one fact that I have seen from both sides of this issue and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1821)|
| 0:30:33| task force members is that the common thread is that both sides love our city and want to see it continue to prosper and continue to grow. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1833)|
| 0:30:43| know many of my colleagues have received many emails from both sides. You have heard me say before that this group of individuals has given their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1843)|

| 0:31:00| having a signed task force has worked and we now need to move forward. Let's approve the proposed ordinance and complete the process. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| know that several members of the present signed task force would like to have an opportunity to address council for a few moments. And I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| honor that request when you consider that these individuals have spent the last three and a half years working on this. And so I'd like to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1876)|

| 0:32:13| including sign height, signed signs, abandoned sign, signage based on road classifications, and many other related issues. After two and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1933)|
| 0:32:25| years, the signed task force decided it could not make further progress and should stop work. It did that without making any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1945)|
| 0:32:34| recommendation. It approved a sign ordinance reorganization this past January after the last meeting. It approved a sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| after three years. It did not recommend any specific sign heights. MPC wrote the ordinance, drafted it many times. It was revised by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=1962)|

| 0:33:43| consensus on the primary issue involved, sign heights. When we started this process, city council had passed a motion to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2023)|
| 0:33:53| signage ordinance. The motion passed on first reading an ordinance setting a 25-foot maximum height for signs at interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2033)|

| 0:35:06| significant lessening of the impact of business signs, and that enlightened urban planning favors monument signs that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| just large enough to be effective. Here we are, stuck in the same old 20th century ugliness. While I would love to see Knoxville sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2113)|
| 0:35:22| clarified and abandoned signs dealt with, I urge you to go back to 2011 when this council heard from the public that they are sick of having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2122)|
| 0:35:33| argue with new businesses in order to prevent a 50-foot pole sign in their neighborhood. Put the numbers back in that will improve the look of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| Knoxville and help our neighborhoods and scenic roads keep their historic, pleasant, and livable character. The chamber keeps saying the genie is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2140)|
| 0:35:52| out of the bottle. Well, we're never going to get it back in the bottle unless we try. If we start now by the time our children and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| grandchildren are grown, a new, meaningful sign ordinance will have a major effect. If we don't start, we are doomed to live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| outrageously sized signs for generations to come. Please vote in favor of the original ordinance, not this version that no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2166)|
| 0:36:15| recommended, or amend this ordinance with the scenic Knoxville recommendations and add back in a protection to state-designated scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2175)|
| 0:36:24| highways in Knoxville. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2184)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you. Councilman Grieve, I mean, that's, to me, it's another statement from sides, it seems like, and I'm troubled by that. And I'm also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2196)|
| 0:36:49| troubled by the comments that she made. I mean, would you agree that you all didn't make any compromise or that you just did? I mean, she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| saying, I mean, I thought you all voted on a document and adopted that document to bring forward. We voted to go ahead and approve, or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2216)|
| 0:37:08| necessarily approve, but we got to a point where we sent on that document as a recommendation to MPC. And then MPC then, of course, sent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| back to city council. But as far as the actual document that you have in front of you, that is a recommendation that was not voted on by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2235)|
| 0:37:29| signed task force on that. It's a combination of what the law department, MPC and the signed task force had on that. But ultimately you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| voted to move it forward. We voted to send it on to MPC and then MPC sent it on to you on that. Yes. So Councilman Grieve, you're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2256)|
| 0:37:51| calling on Mr. Parnell? Yes, Mr. Parnell. Thank you for being here. Name and address for the record, please. Mayor and Council, my name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| Don Parnell, 1214 Craig Road, City of Knoxville. Thank you for the opportunity to share some comments and perspective on the three-year process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2278)|
| 0:38:11| those of us who remain on the signed task force have devoted our time to completing. Thanks is in order to Councilman Grieve, who chaired the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2291)|
| 0:38:20| effort, and Councilman Wallace. Both were diligent in their attendance and participation and insight. Thank you for the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| share. Thanks to Cindy Mitchell, who was incredibly patient. And Mayor, thank you for the city staff that you made available to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2308)|
| 0:38:38| Thanks to each of the surviving members of the task force. It was a privilege to serve with you. It was somewhat amusing to hear that a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| limit would be placed tonight after three and a half years, but there it is. And I'm sticking to it as well. You needn't worry. Our task was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| review the existing signed regulations and propose improvements to City Council. You should all note that we were not asked to create a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2333)|
| 0:39:04| ordinance. The city made it clear that a new ordinance is not presently an option. You should also note that the signed regulations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2344)|
| 0:39:13| dated, have been revised periodically during the past 50 plus years, but have had no overriding theme nor set of guiding principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2353)|
| 0:39:23| To guide an attempt to improve the scope, objectives, application, or enforcement of the regulations. Imagine being asked to create a 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2363)|
| 0:39:33| model car using parts from previous automobiles which were built in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and so on through the present. You get the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2373)|
| 0:39:44| Some principles that guided my own thought process, and I'm speaking for myself, during the three years included the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| The regulation of private property must be done in a judicious manner, always with a clear objective that relates directly to the public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2393)|
| 0:40:03| safety, and welfare. Just because something can be regulated does not require nor even suggest that it must be regulated. Someone is affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| and there is a cost to every regulation. There are always unintended consequences to regulations. The intended consequences should be measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2410)|
| 0:40:28| in their scope and application and should be quantified in terms of their specific impact, cost, and anticipated benefit to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| Creating and maintaining a more pleasing environment is an absolutely appropriate goal for the community, and a balance between and among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2435)|
| 0:40:46| competing interests can be achievable where all those interests are represented, acting in good faith, and prepared to find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2446)|
| 0:40:57| With those points being noted, I would observe the following as to the proposed amendments that the signed task force has recommended, and we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| on individual recommendations. Within the context of the constraints that I mentioned earlier, the task force attempted to find an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| balance in identifying amendments, recognizing that the process of amendment will likely recur during the next few years, as the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2473)|
| 0:41:22| material, effectiveness, and cost of signs continue to evolve, just as the need for and use of signs by the public will continue to evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| within a digital or other environment. Reduction in the currently allowed sign heights was determined to be an appropriate decision, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2488)|
| 0:41:42| recommendation is to reduce that dimension by 40%. Some recommended an 80% reduction, others 30%, and a compromise was reached. Many, many other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| issues were considered, and we've made specific recommendations related to organization of the regulations, definitions, treatment of abandoned signs, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2509)|
| 0:42:05| These recommendations are not nor are they intended to be extreme in their scope of application. Some have and perhaps will argue that regulations should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| linked more closely to a road classification, as opposed to the zoning district, which has been applied to the relevant property. I would at least suggest that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2532)|
| 0:42:27| be careful on that, because the zoning is in place, and the zoning is, in fact, in many cases what will govern. Finally, I would submit to you that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| proposed amendments do represent an improvement over the existing regulations. The proposed changes will not result in a perfect set of regulations, but they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2554)|
| 0:42:45| represent the result of three years of serious deliberations by serious people who were asked to take this on. I would hope that the time and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2565)|
| 0:42:55| expended will count for something. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2575)|
| 0:43:03| Okay. Is there any, are there any comments from council before we start? I just have a quick question. That's a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2583)|
| 0:43:15| Clarification, okay. Clarification. Does portable signs mean mobile signs? Would somebody like to answer that? Krista. Krista Kugrow, City Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| So that would be in our definition section, which is section two, and I'll scroll to that now so we can all listen in. Why don't we just wait until we get to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2602)|
| 0:43:41| Yeah, I think we're going to proceed by section. We'll answer that question. Okay. All right. And so just as you know now, now that we've had the public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| period, all of the discussion will just be among council members unless a member of council asks somebody a question. And that's when the public can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2628)|
| 0:43:58| then come up. Somebody can come up and respond if you're asked a question. Otherwise, that's just the rules of council the way we normally do these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| proceedings. Okay. Councilman Grieve, did you have a? Yes, Mayor. I just want to clarify for my colleagues that on our, one of our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| meetings that we had, we did vote on a number of issues that were in front of us in terms of the sign ordinance. And also then one of the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2652)|
| 0:44:22| things that we did, this was a motion made by George to send the sign ordinance to the city council on that, on recommendations. So, and I do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2662)|
| 0:44:32| list of the different articles that we did vote on, so that if you'd like to get into those as we go through, we'll be glad to. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2672)|
| 0:44:41| Okay. Councilman Della Vopi? Yeah, if I could make just one brief general comment. I mean, there are good people on, I don't want to say both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2681)|
| 0:44:50| sides, there's probably five sides out there that want to be heard and want good things for their city, good things for their business. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| things that hit me the most in the plethora of emails I've received in the last week or so is there may be a misimpression that what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2699)|
| 0:45:11| doing will change the signs that are out there. And that's really not going to happen directly. There are provisions on abandonment and lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2711)|
| 0:45:24| maintenance and everything else. But to do what some people want would require us to have some type of ability to unravel grandfathering of signs. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| have asked for a legal opinion on that and learned what I expected the answer to be, unfortunately, which is that Tennessee state law, Section 13-7-208, has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2731)|
| 0:45:50| provision that allows businesses and industry to build, modify, rebuild their structures once they're built out of the ground and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2750)|
| 0:46:00| under a lawful zoning ordinance, and then the zoning ordinances change. That law apparently still remains important to our courts, and it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2760)|
| 0:46:12| they will not let us at this time do something called amortization, where you could take a reasonable time and reasonable people could disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2772)|
| 0:46:21| about that, but you could say, all right, if you're legal and nonconforming and you're in place, you've got ten years, you've got 15 years, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| then you're going to have to bring the sign into conformance. Such a rule would deal with all of the signs around the city that may not conform to what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| working on tonight. But we are told by our lawyers that really we can't go there, and there are lawsuits that have found that. So we're not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2798)|
| 0:46:49| doing that tonight, and we are not going to affect a lot of signs that are out there, except by moral standards, and we're not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| doing that. There's a lot of persuasion some folks talked about, talking to businesses about some things that become obsolete, and then you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| build a new sign, and some things are abandoned and get taken down as illegal signs at that point. But I hope everyone realizes we're trying to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2823)|
| 0:47:12| good ordinance so that signs approved from here going forward will meet certain standards that hopefully are better than what we have in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| existing law. But we are not going back and changing the signs that are in place because as a municipality we can't go upstream of that state law, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2839)|
| 0:47:34| just wanted that to be out there. Because I don't want anyone to have a misimpression. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| Councilman Grieve, did you want to also comment? Yeah, I'd like to comment to that. Just to say that as we go through this you will see that we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| time working in terms of the maintenance of signs and what's going to be required, and also the look of signs, and that does include existing signs in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2867)|
| 0:47:56| that particular situation. But, Nick, you're right in terms of the fact that grandfathering those signs that are there now are there. But we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| to have expectations of maintenance and upkeep on those, and we'll get into that as we go through. Okay. So thank you. So council, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| start with Section 1. Krista, is there anything that you want to say to start on this? Anything that needs to be pointed out to council? This is Section 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2890)|
| 0:48:21| General Provisions. No, Mayor, we don't have anything. Any discussion on Section 1, General Provisions? Okay. Let's move on to Section 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2901)|
| 0:48:31| Definitions. Krista, is there anything you want to start with, or do we just want council to ask their questions or make comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| I think we'll go ahead with council. Okay. So, Councilman Grave? Yes. I'd like to have a discussion about canopy signs, the definition, and also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2919)|
| 0:48:49| recommend that we do have a definition for mansard roofs, and mansard roofs not be included under the canopy category. And I think Krista can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2929)|
| 0:49:00| address this. Krista? Now, are you discussing that? You're making a motion about this. What are you doing at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2940)|
| 0:49:10| I guess we make a motion in order to discuss it. I think the way we're doing it now, we can discuss it. I just want to be clear. You want to discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| first, and then you might amend it? Yes. So what is your question for Krista? I know Krista has looked into this, and you have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2958)|
| 0:49:27| recommendations for this? I do. I think there have been some comments about a distinction between a canopy versus a mansard roof, and there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| a suggestion that a mansard roof should be removed from the definition for canopy, which is on the screen here above the table. So if we wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2974)|
| 0:49:47| that, we could proceed with that. And then we may want to explicitly specify that a mansard roof is not a canopy, and to that end, I've prepared a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| definition for mansard roof that I can present if Council wishes. Okay. So we have some more. Are you discussing that? Yeah, I have that and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=2994)|
| 0:50:05| other. But with regard to that, on 2.2, which is on page 2 of this document, the last half of canopy has that language about mansard roof being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| canopy, and you could simply strike that as a start. I have seen other comments from people who have written who have said if we use, and it would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3012)|
| 0:50:27| beyond 2.2 to the part where there are other specific definitions, I don't know whether that's a different number or not. I don't guess it does, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| use the awning and canopy signs definition in the existing zoning law, which says a sign that is printed or sewn onto durable material and hung over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3034)|
| 0:50:49| doorways and storefronts that provide shelter and shade for pedestrians which shall be limited to street-level businesses. And that was the definition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| we've had historically. Perhaps those two changes together might get you closer to where you need to be on this issue. Are you speaking to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3055)|
| 0:51:08| canopy at this point? Yeah. I just want to make sure, Krista, that we have better examples. I mean, I think the example of a canopy sign is not, it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3068)|
| 0:51:18| shows a roof sign, and I mean, you just need a better example there. I think that's more of an example of a roof sign. I think that's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| example of a canopy sign, and it is a canopy sign. The one on page 8? The one on page 8, right. I think there's better examples than that. That's what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3085)|
| 0:51:33| getting at. Okay. Okay, so Krista, do you have, based on your understanding of this, do you have some, a proposed amendment? I do. I think based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3093)|
| 0:51:44| conversation, we could strike the sentence that I'm highlighting here, which says, the lower, steeper portion of a mansion roof shall be considered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| canopy for the purposes of this section if there's no enclosed space below this portion of the mansard roof. So that would eliminate the mansard roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3111)|
| 0:52:00| from the canopy definition, and then we could explicitly say, canopy does not include mansard roof, and include a definition for mansard roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3120)|
| 0:52:10| Right. So moved. Right. I agree with that. I make that motion. Okay, so that's, that's a motion. Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3130)|
| 0:52:20| Yeah, I'll second that. I would like to ask a question. On page 8, Krista, the canopy sign, number 1, with the honeydew on it, is that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| canopy? I mean, a mansard or a canopy? That looks like a mansard roof to me. I believe that that's a mansard roof. Okay. It's at least a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3149)|
| 0:52:38| roof sign. It's a roof sign. That's what it looks like to me. We need a new picture. You need a new picture. I think you need a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| example of that. Right. So we could also have a motion to strike the pictures that are not relevant or somehow misrepresent the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3164)|
| 0:52:55| Well, I'm in the motion to replace that with a better example. How's that? The one that says canopy sign 1, is that the one you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| Okay. Good. Okay, so the motion, I mean, Mr. Frost, former councilman. Thank you. We actually have one motion on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3182)|
| 0:53:17| Councilman Wallace. I guess maybe depending on how that's voted on, you might want to make your motion subsequent to that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| Vote on the first motion first. Mayor Brown. I'd like to get a little clearer definition on the mansard roof. If you would, Crystal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3204)|
| 0:53:36| Yeah, hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3216)|
| 0:53:54| So here on the screen, you'll see a definition for mansard or mansard roof. I think those terms are used interchangeably. A roof or portion of a roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3234)|
| 0:54:04| containing two slipping panes of different pitch. The lower plane has a much steeper pitch often approaching vertical than the upper plane, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| usually not visible from the ground. It contains no gables. Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3252)|
| 0:54:24| Is that from the building code, Mayor? No, we don't have a definition of mansard roof in the building code. This was based on research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3264)|
| 0:54:33| Table 7.1, if I may, Mayor, has a picture that looks like a mansard roof to me, and that's what you defined, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| Okay. So what is the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| My motion is to remove the portion of the definition under canopy that we removed the portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| that refers to mansard roof that Crystal blanked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| Okay. You have Ms. Mitchell and Crystal. And we had a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| Is that clear to council what we're doing? Okay. So we're going to vote on that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| Just the narrow removal and not the new definition? Correct. Okay. The removal of that sentence under canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3319)|
| 0:55:28| 2.2. Okay. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| We have it passes 8 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| I can't call on you unless council chooses to call on you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| Okay. So that motion, that amendment passes 8 to 1 to strike that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| Mayor, I would then like to make a motion to adopt the mansard roof definition that Crystal provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| I think it's been projected on the board. I don't know if it has yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| I would put that, a reference to the picture in the third picture in table 7.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| So that it's defined in words and picture. That would seem to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Okay. We have a motion and a second. Is that clear to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| Any other discussion? This is about the definition of the mansard roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| Mansard roof. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| Absent the picture here, we don't have any other reference as far as I can recall to mansard roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| So we would have this definition in the definition section of the zoning code, but it wouldn't be referenced in any other context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| So we're defining a term that's not used anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| We would say canopy does not include a mansard roof or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| But I just want to point that out. I would amend my motion to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| All right. So any other discussion from council on that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| Okay. Anything else on section 2 definitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| Yes. I have one, Mayor. Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| I actually have an additional definition, but I want to call on Ms. Malone to tell us if there is anything else she objects to about the canopy awning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| Because we're on that now and we might as well wrap that up. Be really brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| I would ask that the canopy pitched drawing of table 7.1 be deleted, given the changes that you've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3477)|
| 0:58:12| The middle picture? That middle picture, yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| I don't see what it serves since you're no longer going to allow a mansard roof to be a canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| In fact, if you look at it in conjunction with the honeydew donut sign that no one seems to think is a canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| but under the present definition before it was changed by you guys, and thank you so much, that honeydew sign was in fact a canopy sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| But so is that middle picture a problem? It would be considered a canopy pitched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| And I think you don't want that. Thank you so much. I know I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| I would suggest to the commission that we delete the center picture on table 7.1, canopy pitched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| and that turning over to page 8, the table 7.2, that we strike the canopy sign 1 that has the honeydew donuts thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3539)|
| 0:59:11| that is not a mansard roof, but is masquerading as one, and find a better example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| So we would strike the middle picture on 7.1 and then strike the picture, the third one on the row for table 7.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3557)|
| 0:59:27| to clarify that and get a better picture inserted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| Okay. Was there a second to that? Second. Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| Everyone's clear what we're voting on? Okay. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| Opposed? Passes. I have one other definitional one, Mayor. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| I would like to, on page 6, just insert alphabetically the definition of a logo sign since we have exempt signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| and we have signs exempted by other bodies, and I would like to have something that reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| logo sign colon a business informational or directional sign located on an interstate highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| or off-ramp, which is regulated by TDOT, and that way we would know later in the exemption sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3613)|
| 1:00:22| that what that is and that it falls under the exemption since another body regulates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3622)|
| 1:00:30| Councilman DellaVolpe, could you repeat that please? Yes. A business informational or directional sign located on an interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| and I don't know whether you use highway or freeway here, whatever you normally use in here, or off-ramp, which is regulated by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3637)|
| 1:00:49| So the key is located on an interstate roadway and or off-ramp and regulated by another body, TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3649)|
| 1:00:59| I think I'm missing a word. I was typing as you were speaking. Can you check on the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| A business informational or directional sign located on an interstate or off-ramp, which is regulated by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| I guess that's fine. Informational or directional. That's right. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| Okay, is there a second? Second. Does Council know what we're voting on? It's right there in front of you, the logo sign definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| Any other discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| Passes 9-0. Councilman DellaVolpe, do you have more? I'm sorry, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| Okay, Council, anything else in this section? Chris, does anything that we needed to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| Let me check your, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3707)|
| 1:02:04| For clarification from the chairman, if I could, when she's looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| Under window sign, we're not regulating them, but we have a big definition. It has television or monitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| Does that make an EMT thing in a window sign or is that an EMT and it's regulated some other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3736)|
| 1:02:25| In other words, are we opening up a door by having that there? And I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| Are you an EMC? I'm an EMC, the electronic messaging center type sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| In other words, could you put a computer screen in the window and start flashing messages that are changeable in a window sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3757)|
| 1:02:46| Are we legitimizing something that we don't allow now, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| George, do you remember the discussion on that? Did we have a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| We didn't want, or I think part of the discussion was around you couldn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| That counts as a sign, and that's what you're saying in that definition, that a TV facing outward, a TV screen, that counts as a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| And you're later going to prohibit it. Because you can't have window signs, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| Well, you can have window signs, and you don't regulate it. They're exempt, are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| They're exempt. So are we sort of legitimizing something we don't want to, I guess, is my question, since we're not going to have a formal regulation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3802)|
| 1:03:30| If I may interject, I was going to propose, because in the draft that came from the sign task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| the sign task force voted to move window signs from, I believe it was section three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| they were prohibited after a certain area that they took up in the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| So they were allowed up to a certain percent of the window space or a certain square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| The sign task force voted to exempt window signs entirely from regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| I inserted the word temporary upon my review of the draft, and in reviewing the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| I want to propose a definition for temporary window sign and permanent window sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| So I'm going to present those for your consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| and I don't know if we would want to just adopt those then or keep the window sign as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| and adopt temporary and permanent as subcategories of a window sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| So let me pull those up, and this may give you a better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3874)|
| 1:04:41| So I have the definitions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Essentially, it's what the crux is of the difference between the definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| is on the third line for temporary window signs and on the third line for permanent window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| Basically, what is the intent of the display?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Is it there to be temporary for a short period of time, or is it intended to be permanent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| And this is the, I think, what the sign task force had discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| We've got these window signs that are for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| They change frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| They advertise sales versus signs that advertise the business itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| or a product that it's selling, and it's there for an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| If you all desire, we can define that period of time, but these are the definitions that I prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| But you still don't regulate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Temporary window signs would be exempt from regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| I see, but not permanent, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Permanent window signs essentially count as a wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3942)|
| 1:05:52| And that would go here on page 7 as part of the window sign description definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3952)|
| 1:06:00| It could replace them or work in conjunction with that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| I think my recommendation may be to replace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3967)|
| 1:06:16| I don't mind defining it, but I think you're going to have to further define what that window sign is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| Is it a graphic that doesn't display the logo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| Is that a sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| I think there are examples around town where it's just a really colorful graphic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| that has nothing to do with sale or even items they sell there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| It's more of a graphic, and that would be it's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4000)|
| 1:06:48| I think that was the task force said we shouldn't regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| It was hard to regulate temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| It's almost unregulatable, I think, to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| And then permanent signs, you're going to have to define it a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| And this is why we met for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| When you get in the weeds, you're in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| You're in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| When it comes to permanent or non-permanent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| would it be necessary to specify some type of length of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| in terms of trying to enforce something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| I think that could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| I'll leave it to counsel to decide what period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| Sounds like a display for more than six months or permanently kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| I mean something that's longer than the sale of the week or the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| Maybe Dwayne does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| You should have brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| We'll send it back to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| I do want to add, so as the mayor mentioned at the outset of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| at the end of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| I think the goal is to send whatever we've amended back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| Most certainly you all can ask MPC to make a recommendation on specific items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| you know, if we get so far and there's only so far that we can get tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| You know, on a specific issue such as this or there may be other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| So I think you all can, MPC is going to look at the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| and so they can take up specific issues within that if we request them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| And I think that, you know, that's their bailiwick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| and certainly within counsel's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| In light of what we're really doing is making a recommendation to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| to look at and advise us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| I'll move to adopt this as is, as you've typed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| and we'll wait for what their recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Okay, so you are, so the definitions that are on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| you are amending this to include those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| Yes, and replacing the old window sign definition with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Mayor, if we're going to do it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I want to hear from the business community what impact this is going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| If we're going to go down the rabbit hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| I want counsel to hear how it's going to affect the business side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| I mean, I'm just confused as to how this is moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| I mean, it was my under, well, I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| I'm a little bit shocked as to how this is moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| But for every change we make, I think we need to hear, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| let's just open it up then, let's just hear from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| And, you know, we'll be here until 4 a.m. possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| But I can't vote on this without knowing the impact it's going to have on the community, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| and the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| So I'd like to call on Mr. Reutin to address this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| Let's limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| You know, what are you going to give him, three minutes or two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| No, I mean, we've given everybody five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Let's go five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| I mean, let's just go on and open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| Are you calling on me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Well, I would like to also speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| My name is Chris Reutin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| I'm 3100 Weigel Lane, PAL 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| I would just like to point out that we very clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| I'm with the Knoxville Chamber as well as Weigel stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| We very clearly went through this process with the task force ad nauseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| and talked about how hard it would be to regulate, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| I think Ms. Palmer brought up a point very, very early on in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| that she did not want to vote for something that would put an extra set of enforceability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4293)|
| 1:11:43| on the laps of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| I can't imagine anybody trying to enforce one of those things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| We also very clearly said that you're actually coming inside of a man's business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| or a lady's business and trying to regulate internally in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| That's something that we definitely don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| We gave very good examples of Asha's Liquor Store, Fresh Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| A lot of places in Turkey Creek don't have big poll signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| They have window signs that they rely on to conduct business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| So there are multitudes of examples of where we gave the task force reasons why you don't regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4331)|
| 1:12:21| Duane can tell counsel what that vote was, but they voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| It was clear, the consensus, and it was a supermajority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| Okay, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, and I am also a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| I'm also president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| I think that the scenario in the task force was just maybe a little bit different than was just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| I think it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Scenic Knoxville thinks it's very important to regulate window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| They affect the public right-of-way just like all other signs do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| as long as they're visible from the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Two years ago, so we've been dealing with this a long time on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| Mark Donaldson introduced language which would only allow 10% of a window to be covered with signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| Some members of the task force didn't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| We discussed it at length, and a compromise was reached amongst task force members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| which would allow coverage of 25% or 20 square feet, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| However, at the very last meeting in January, this issue was put on the agenda again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4419)|
| 1:13:47| even though it had already been settled and a compromise had been reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| and it was subject to a vote, and because of the composition of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| the compromise that had already been reached was thrown out so that going forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4435)|
| 1:14:03| there wouldn't be any regulation on window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| I want to make a note that in the town center zoning in our current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| and in the new zoning for Cumberland Avenue, they are only allowed to cover 10% of their window space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| This is not an unusual aspect to a sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| The language that we're proposing and that had been in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| is very common language in many ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| and just a sampling of cities that have very similar language in their ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| are Nashville, Memphis, Farragut, Lexington, Kentucky, and Raleigh, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| Obviously, these cities are finding a way to regulate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| and I don't think it would be that difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| It's very important that EMCs and monitors not be allowed as part of window signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4492)|
| 1:15:03| and also that digital open signs, only one per business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| and that they cannot flash or scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Sorry to raise this, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| I was just worried that we were putting EMCs in the designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| I thought we didn't regulate window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| Do you wish to speak to this, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| My name is Courtney Coffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| I live at 611 Gill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| I am a business owner in Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| I own Rococo Boutique in the Knoxville Graphic House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Two exterior walls out of four of my business are windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| So if I were told that I was only allowed to use 10% of my window space for decoration or signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4547)|
| 1:15:55| it would be very difficult for me to structure my store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| Right now I have a large graphic fox that I feel like is fun for people that walk into Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| In fact, we get lots of foot traffic inside the store that are grateful for the fun, unique designs that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| So that graphic cost me quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| So to have the graphic fox or for me to put up dresses or some sort of dress form in the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4581)|
| 1:16:31| how is it fair for myself to be regulated on if I have a fox that I choose to put up seasonally that costs me money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4591)|
| 1:16:40| that's not stuck to the window or hanging in the window for what items that I'm supposed to have in my windows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4600)|
| 1:16:49| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| Yeah, again, I thought the task force didn't set out to regulate window signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| and I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| That may be something we want to take up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| I was just concerned at the original question was are we introducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| and making allowable EMCs where we don't want them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| and that was the only issue that I was starting to raise, and I think we got off on a tangent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| I mean, I think it's important that we get a sign ordinance together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| This one's been beat on and debated for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| There was a compromise decision not to regulate window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| I think we should leave that for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| The only question in front of us now is do we need a corrected definition or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| and I think we should narrow it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| I think what we're asking, what you're asking for right now is put it in the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| We're not talking about whether to prohibit them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I mean, right now, and the point is you've mentioned these words later on, so it should be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| So I second the motion to include those two definitions as presented before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| for window sign temporary and window sign permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| What you're doing is taking the existing window sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| and further defining what's temporary and what's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| That's what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| It's not regulating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| It's just giving a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| All we're doing is putting it in definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I really think we need to take a look at ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| about how far we're going into the weeds on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| This task force spent a long time, debated, argued, fussed, cussed, must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| and came up with some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| And I really think that we need to be very weary of getting off into the weeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| to redo the work that took three years to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| And frankly, I doubt if this council wants to be here three years working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| So what we have, we have a motion on the table to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| to add these definitions of what window signs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| It is not regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| It is definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| And we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Well, I want to point out, and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| but some of this language was added since the sign task force looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| We did not have a definition for window, permanent window sign or temporary window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| We just looked at it in the category window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| It's been added since, you know, since their law department looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| So, I mean, we're not, I mean, we got into the weeds when you get into the legalities of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| We're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| That's unavoidable sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| So you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| I mean, when you start putting definitions, then you start regulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| I mean, that's the problem that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| I mean, what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Tell me, somebody tell me, Krista, tell me exactly what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| just to make sure that what I'm hearing from other council members is so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| So we are deleting the current definition for window sign, adding these two definitions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Temporary window signs, until we get to that section and it changes, you know, if it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| This is on page 12 of your document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Temporary window signs are exempt from regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| So as I believe Chris was speaking about, these signs that are, you know, in the windows and that change very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| those are exempt from regulation under the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| Permanent window signs are the ones that perhaps the owner of the boutique on Market Square was speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| Those are treated as wall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| So those would be calculated towards the allowable sign area for a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| which is typically based on, you know, how much frontage they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| You know, it's calculated based on the building elevation, so how much frontage there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| And so this, depending on how the definition ends up sorting out at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| if they provide a time period recommendation, I'm not sure where her sign would fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| But, you know, if MPC ends up saying temporary window signs are signs that are up for no more than 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| you know, it sounded like her sign was up for a season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| So that would be a permanent window sign for which she could get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| It would count towards the sign, the allowable sign area for her business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| and that's just a wall sign essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| So that's what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| It sounds like seasonal is temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I mean, that doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| I thought we were getting out of the window sign business, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| We're clarifying the definitions so we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| I want to call the question so we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| So what we are doing here is just what is being proposed is a definition of what a temporary window sign is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| and what a permanent window sign is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Vice Mayor, do you still want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Procedurally, I mean, he can call the question, but I think there's further discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| I didn't call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| I know you didn't, but correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| We need to vote on a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Well, let me ask, we can do that, or if there's more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| I'll withdraw if there's more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| He'll withdraw his motion if there's more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Yeah, I mean, we're defining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| I mean, Councilman Dale Volpe makes a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| To me, a seasonal sign is not a permanent sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| So, you know, I think the shop owner makes a good, you know, a good valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4976)|
| 1:23:04| I mean, it just, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| We say we're not doing it, but I feel like we are when you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| We don't even know what seasonal and permanent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| Well, Section 4, we're going to get into signs that are exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| And right now, and the way it came from the task force, was that window signs were exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| And what Krista added that came back to us, and we saw it at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| was what you're seeing in front of you is this red and green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| And she added in there the temporary window signs and permanent window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| And, you know, so when we get to Section 4, temporary window signs are already exempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| and then we're going to have the discussion at that point whether we want to exempt permanent window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| And that's, you know, she added that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| That was added after the fact, and this is really the first time we've had to really devote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| So that one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| If I may, you all certainly do not have to accept my recommendation of adding the word temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| But to, I think where that would leave you is we have the definition here of a window sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| So as it's stricken through on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| And so that would presumably, although, you know, there's interpretation matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| and we would need to coordinate with the Plans Review and Inspections Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| You know, this could include, and I could foresee a business owner arguing that this type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| this definition of window sign as it stands includes the type of graphics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| that are affixed permanently to the windows through some sort of adhesive vinyl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| and that, you know, obstruct the entire window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| A crowning goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| A crowning goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Something like that that takes up the whole window and that is there to advertise the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| So that was my concern is that we have, there's a distinction between temporary window signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| these small ones that change periodically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| and these permanent window signs that have a significant presence on the elevation of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| But you all do not have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| On page 1231, I added the word temporary, and you all certainly can move to strike that if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| Well, do you think that, I mean, Councilman Wallace is talking about, you know, Section 4 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| But for clarity, I mean, shouldn't we discuss, I mean, that whole issue then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| I mean, we're piecemealing it along, but we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| there's going to be further discussion on another section about whether it's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| I mean, you know, how can we make, I don't know, Councilman, how we can make decisions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| with this type of a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| I don't really know. I'll just, I'll yield, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| If we left the original definition that has been crossed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| wouldn't we be addressing the whole idea later on in this ordinance on page 7, page 12, whatever we've referred to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5169)|
| 1:26:18| So page 12 currently, as it's written with the word that I added temporary, is temporary window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5178)|
| 1:26:27| So that leaves the question, then, what is a permanent window sign, and do we need to define that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| or do we want to just go back to window sign, and that would perhaps include all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| I'd like to revise my motion to original window sign, strike the words a television or monitor as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| because I'm worried about that EMC issue creeping in the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| We don't need to introduce that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| I think that's a danger that will confuse enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5209)|
| 1:26:59| Just have a simple window sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| Well, I think that his last statement makes the whole case here is how do you enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5221)|
| 1:27:15| You can't enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| How many codes folks do we have out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| One. I think we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| I mean, how are we going to enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| So I think, you know, I've never been a fan of, you know, passing something that we can't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| I mean, it could be, I mean, people could call in, I guess, but I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| we're putting restrictions in here that may sound good and feel good at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| but if it's not enforceable, then folks will be coming right back to us eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| filling this auditorium up and saying, why aren't you enforcing what you passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| So how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| Okay, what is the motion before us now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| The motion is to amend the word window sign that's in the text that we have on page seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| to strike the words a television or monitor or including a television or monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| whatever is more appropriate according to the lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| just so that we take out the concern that maybe we're allowing some EMCs and not others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| and we get into a whole level of signs that we don't want to get near.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| Definitions, to approve the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| Did you remove the motion on the definitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| I've struck the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| and the substitute motion that I'm making is to simply amend the window sign language we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| taking out the television or monitor example or illustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| because I think that hasn't been thought through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| and I don't know that we have time to get into those weeds now, so we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| Okay, so the temporary and permanent definitions are off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| They're off the table for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Okay, and so the amendment is to remove television or monitor from the current window sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| I guess probably logically you would take out the words including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| but not limited to a television or monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| That's what I have on the screen, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| I'll let you all take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5365)|
| 1:29:41| Just stuff in a window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| Okay, are we ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| That's seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Mayor, we've been here an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| Can we take a little break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Yes, we'll take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| I'll make a motion that we have a ten minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Ten minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| We'll continue if everyone will please take their seats or stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5415)|
| 1:30:29| talking back there and we'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| So council, is there anything else on section two definitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| We will move on to section three, prohibited signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| Excuse me, Mayor, did we vote on section two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| We voted on Councilman Dela Vope's window sign striking of that one phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| And so that took care of number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Section three is prohibited signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Is there anything that council wishes to discuss on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| I move we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| We don't have to have an affirmative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| Oh, you don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| Well, I would like to ask a question, and that is the last item, roof signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| since I think we defined mansard as a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| Included, or do we even need to mention it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| Did you understand the question, Rob and Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Since it's a type of roof, I don't think that we need to include it, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| Okay, so there's nothing that needs to be changed in section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| We'll move on to section four, signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| I'd like to call on Councilwoman Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| Former Councilwoman Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Many, many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Section three, prohibited signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| The only reason I would leave roof signs in there is because we need to know if they're in or they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5517)|
| 1:32:07| They're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| Okay, so we're leaving them in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| On section three, number two, I ask that the last sentence be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| What it reads as a whole is signs which contain or make use of any word, phrase, symbol, shape, form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5540)|
| 1:32:28| or character in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead, or confuse traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| That's prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| But then it says excluded from this are permitted incidental signs such as directional, directory, or information signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5555)|
| 1:32:44| Do we really want to suggest that those signs are free to confuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5564)|
| 1:32:55| There's no reason to have that phrase in there unless we want to argue with somebody about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| or not his sign is confusing and whether or not our ordinance permits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| Move to strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| Are there any legal issues that you all foresee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| So there's a motion and a second to strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| The last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| The last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| This does not include permitted incidental signs such as directional, directory, or informational signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| Any discussion on that, council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| Anything else on prohibited signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| I was asked not to stir up the pot so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| Issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| Section four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| Section four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| Oh, section four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Yeah, a real simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Under number three, it says signs required by federal or state or local statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| I want to put signs required by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| I'll sign question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Required, comma, or separately regulated, comma, by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| Because that would include the logo signs, which are run by the TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| And we've defined it as being regulated by them, but they're not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| They're permissive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| So signs required, comma, or separately regulated, comma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| That's all I want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| That sounds really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| It does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Because all signs would be regulated by local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| We're regulating all local signs, so now we're exempting them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| It makes no sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| How about separately permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| Okay, we're on section four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| Signs exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Prior to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| When will you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| I mean, if that was an issue, I mean, I don't know, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5689)|
| 1:34:58| I think the amendment makes it more confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| I was trying to clarify, but you think it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| I'll withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| Okay, counsel, I would like to, if you all don't mind, I want to find out what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| this was a question about the portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| Do you all mind since he's sitting through all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| Come on up, Robin, and go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Thanks, Madeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| I just wanted to define or strike from the regulatory signs pedestrian-powered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| or bicycle-powered portable signs on trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| There needs to be some exemption there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| If not, then I need to know the process for making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| How is that addressed, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| Which number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| So the gentleman who just spoke, we've spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| and I think what he explained to me is he has a bicycle trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| and he, you know, tows a sign on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| So as this is currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| it's just talking about any trailer that is designed to be transported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| with only incidental parking, assembling for use, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| You know, although I don't know the intent of the sign task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| and MPC in drafting this particular provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| one thought is that this may have been to address vehicular portable signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| the ones that are on trucks or somehow towed behind trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| So if you all wanted to make a distinction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I think you could add a phrase in here that says designed to be transported by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| or on right where my cursor is right here, by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| or on a vehicle, automobile, truck, something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| What number are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| We're on page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| No, we're in the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| We're still in the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| And now where on the definitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| Page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| Packet page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Portable signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Signs carried by a person are exempt in section 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| as well as signs contained on or affixed to vendor carts in section 4 are also exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5848)|
| 1:37:38| What number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| And I don't know if that meets the definition of either of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| This is he's on a bicycle pulling a little trailer with a sign, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| I don't think that qualifies as a vendor push cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| We have a specific license chapter on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| That's not in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| It's in a different part of our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| Push carts or bicycles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Mayor, if we inserted the phrase motor-driven vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| that would take care of his pedal-driven vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| but at the same time would not allow trucks to go up and down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| So that would be where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Where would you add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| So we're looking at the definition for portable sign after the word transported by a vehicle or automobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5902)|
| 1:38:32| by or on a vehicle or automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| How about by motor-driven vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| And that would take care of cars, trucks, motorcycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5917)|
| 1:38:49| Does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| Did you see the definition before you on portable signs with the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| I think we would need a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Look on your screen, portable sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| It adds by or on a motor-driven vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| That passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| And if you all don't mind, there's an extra comma there at the end of that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| I'm just going to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| Give you grammar authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| What else, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| So we're on Section 4, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| We are back to Section 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| Signs are exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Signs exempt from regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Number 31 says temporary window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| I'd like to add temporary and permanent window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| We don't have temporary or permanent in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| So all window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| So I'll strike temporary and add all window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| Where is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| That's on 31 under Section 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| Number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| It says all window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| So you want to strike temporary and just say window signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| All window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| A-L-L-O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| There's a motion on number 31, which is page 20 of the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| to strike temporary and say all window signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| So all window signs would be exempt from regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Was there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| Is there discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Councilman Dellavopi, is that an old one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| That's an old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| I'd like to have Chris to show us a revision to item number 24, political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| That's again on page 20 of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| Under temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| Having to do with a time limit and also a reduction in the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| What's the reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| Krista has one written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| Councilman Grieve and I spoke earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| and I explained to him upon reviewing this particular provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| we determined that the time period set out here didn't actually reflect how election cycles run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6090)|
| 1:41:39| I'm a lawyer, not a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| So after looking at that, I have a recommendation to change the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6101)|
| 1:41:49| Let me pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| So here on your screen, I tracked the changes so you can see what I'm proposing to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| So this is the current definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| The words there in red are stricken or added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| and the final version is there below it as it would read with those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| So essentially this provides that the signs can go up 30 days prior to the earliest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| the start of the earliest voting period, such as early voting or the primaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| and do not have to be removed until five days following the final voting period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| so the general election, election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| About three months from September to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| It depends on the type of election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| Right, but normally it's about three months, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| For local elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| Five days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| What we were running into was we would have to make people take signs down for like a couple weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| in between early voting and the general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and we felt like that was cumbersome from an enforcement and administrative perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| and we felt like this was a good way to allow people to have their political signs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6189)|
| 1:43:19| Okay, so that's your motion, Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| I'd like to have a little bit of discussion on the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Those are four-by-eight signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| I think most of us use one-and-a-half-by-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| I was going to make a motion separate for 16 square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6215)|
| 1:43:43| I love political signs, especially when they have my name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| I think most of the general public finds them irritating and obnoxious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| and especially there's just some sort of arms race for bigger and bigger political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| 32 feet seems too big to me, so that's why I think even 16 feet is pretty big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| but I'd make a motion to change that to 16 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| No, I don't have any printed yet, do you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| Do you want to consider those as separate motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| I think they're separate motions, but we can combine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| You're going to combine them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| We might have discussion on the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| I was going to second Councilman Starr's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| and I wanted to ask do we have something on the books now concerning that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| concerning removal of those signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| I guess I'll ask attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| I don't think that we have anything regarding political signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| I think there had been discussion at the task force meeting in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| that the election commission regulated those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| but upon researching that I wasn't able to find anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| I know that I looked at the county regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| The county regulates political signs in a similar manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| although off the top of my head I don't recall the size or if they have a size delineated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| but I did look at their language and use that in part for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| I think our regulations are they can't be in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| And I'm not sure if there's a time limit on when they have to be removed already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| I think they have to be removed within a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| Five days is right for the removal, but I don't know that we have a start date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| I think 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Where would that be in terms of the right-of-way restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| That's probably in the engineering code, if I had to guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| because that's just engineering has purview over the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| and you can't put stuff in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| No, it's in here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| It's in here in the prohibited, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| What I'm saying, it's regulated in a different section of our city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Do you all want this as two amendments or one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Do you all care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Does everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Comments over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Sorry, more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Councilwoman Palmer, did you have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Well, I want a third Marshall Stairs proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| I think four by four is plenty large, and as he pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| we are having an arms race to see if we can have bigger signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| and as far as I know, a sign has never voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6385)|
| 1:46:32| How long have you been around here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| Well, it makes the campaign workers feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Yeah, I mean, they're temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| They go up, they come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| They got regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| When you can put them up and put them down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| I don't see regulating it to a four by four as opposed to a four by eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| is really going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| I mean, it's still a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| You have a lot of other elections other than your local elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| There are cases where on busy streets a four by eight is pretty important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| when you're thinking certainly larger state and national elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| So I don't know why you would limit it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| I'm not sure that 30 days prior to the earliest time you can vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| is enough time for state and national elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| But I don't know why you would limit it to four by four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| when four by eight is a very common sign out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| I would be opposed to limiting it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6448)|
| 1:47:36| The people that are speaking against it are probably having a run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| or are already term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| It has to do with sign clutter, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| So, Krista, what would we do so folks that qualify to run for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6466)|
| 1:47:53| I mean, do we give them a notification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| I don't ever remember getting such notification as to sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| what the restrictions are, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Are you talking about at the end of the election cycle or just generally speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| Either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| I mean, the way this works, you have to 30 days prior to the start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| the early voting period, and then it has to come down, as it should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| five days following the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| How are we going to communicate that to a candidate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| I recall from the first time I ran for city council that actually the public service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| sent out letters to all candidates who had qualified reminding them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| here's the ordinances, no rights of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| and just put the campaigns on notice of what was on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| I don't remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| I remember getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| And question, this may be an obvious question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| So if you have a county race, and I want to use, I don't know what the district is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| but Commissioner Broyles, for example, I think has a completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| her district is within the city, but it's a county seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| and they have an ordinance, and if we have an ordinance, which one prevails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6558)|
| 1:49:29| I'm just making sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| The city's inside of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| I mean, this is my general thought, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| Pretend Commissioner Broyles was running for re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| She's not putting up a county government sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| I don't think the city would try to come in and regulate a Knox County government sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6590)|
| 1:49:58| just like I don't think Knox County would want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| just thinking about civics and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| I think Commissioner Broyles might have to comply with the city sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| I'm just asking, I'm just raising that question because it could come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| Because the city's within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| If you were in a commission district that is part city, part county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| then your signs within the city would have to be the smaller signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| and your signs in your district that's outside of the city could likely be the larger signs, I would presume, by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6629)|
| 1:50:38| if the county doesn't have any regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| So the same for state and federal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Yeah, I mean, we're talking about where the sign's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| And if it's within the city limits, then it has to follow the city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| He's worried in a presidential election there might be a big sign, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| Yeah, that's what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| Okay, I'm going to suggest we divide these into two since these are two different issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| if that's all right with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| The first motion, we have a motion and a second on the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| Do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| That's the temporal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| The first one, okay, who made the motion or who wants to make that motion on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| The temporal part, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Time, effort, shall not be displayed for more than 30 days prior to the start of the earliest voting period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| for the candidate or issue and shall be removed within five days following the end of the final voting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| That would be the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| And who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Is there any discussion on that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Just two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| I'm a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| You're a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Okay, one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| And the second part is on the size of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Yes, I move to change 32 square feet to 16 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| Councilman Dellavopa, are you just going to keep your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| I'll just call on you every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Is there any discussion on the 16 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| I guess, I mean, again, who's going to call Lamar and who's going to call Corker and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| you better by golly come down here and get these signs right or you're going to have trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| You're going to be in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| Yeah, I think we're going way off base there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| Well, there's still opportunity for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| I mean, so this, you know, wherever this ends up, there's not going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6763)|
| 1:52:50| Yeah, vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| And then, again, you're going to see it multiple times here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| You're going to see it two more times after today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| But it would be good to give some direction to MPC on what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| You could make it where it's for local candidates only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Make it for local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| You could do it for local candidates and for national office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| That's just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| Okay, so as it is now, is there a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Okay, and this is to make this the largest sign would be 16 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Okay, let's do a roll call on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| Now I'm going to put my weight on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Okay, fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| We've got two more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| Right now it's still four by eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| Yeah, I have just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| Maybe I'll address this to the chair of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| Do we regulate banners mounted on light poles and other things along public streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| There's a series of those going up like in East Knoxville and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| Are they regulated or not regulated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| I didn't know how we covered them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| This section is on signs that are exempt from regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| and I didn't know whether we have separate regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| Maybe Kristen knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| Those banners you stick on light poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| Yeah, off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| I think that those are probably approved by the city in some manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| I think there's a city permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| Anne Wallace to the rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6880)|
| 1:54:50| The city has a policy through our special events program that approves those banners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| When they are within the right-of-way, they go through the city process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| It falls into similar things like engineering signs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| So if it says welcome to Forth and Gill, is that a special event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| It's provided for through our special events process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| They regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| So anything else on Section 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| We're moving on rapidly to Section 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| We call on Carleen, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| And very briefly, 22 and 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| 22 says decorative flags and bunting for celebration, convention, or commemoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| subject to removal within seven days following the event, but it doesn't give a start time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| So I guess you could take it down on the seventh day and put it up on the eighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| What number are you on, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| So we need a start date there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| I don't care when the start date is, but, you know, it makes no sense without one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| 23 is more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| It provides, and again, these are signs that do not require, they're exempt from regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6960)|
| 1:56:09| and this has to do with signs on residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| But if you go to Section 10, there's a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| There it says that these same signs require permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| So I would suggest that I think we're all in agreement on what we intend or would hope it would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6982)|
| 1:56:31| That's not my point, but my point is we don't need something saying it's exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| and something else saying you need a permit because that doesn't sound unregulated to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| And I think, you know, your staff could probably straighten this out for you after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| So yes, no is not a preferred method of regulating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| I think there's an easy fix to what Ms. Malone commented on, and we can get to that when we get to Section 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| For both 22 and 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I'm sorry, just for what she was referencing about 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| So what about 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| When do you start was the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I mean, I think she makes a good, valid point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| I mean, what, 10 days, two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| Ms. Wallace, do we regulate that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| Like if we had a special, the AIA coming in or whomever, when they can start putting up their, excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7040)|
| 1:57:31| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| What was the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| Is there a, if we were having the AIA convention coming to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| when could they start putting up banners across Gay Street or Henley Bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| That's covered in the special event policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| My understanding, that's available on the city's website under the special events category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| and it has a full form that has to be filled out, and it's covered through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Not putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Do you know what it is by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| I don't know it in that level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| But that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| As long as it's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| But it's a sign exempt from regulation, then it's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| It's kind of weird, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| You see, I'm not sure this refers just to public right-of-way, that is the public event stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| It doesn't say just public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| This could be on private property, and that's not covered by special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| I was going to make that same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| So this is, you know, these are, we're having a blowout sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| These could be any, you know, a celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| I don't know if that would qualify for a celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| But, you know, these are events that could take place on private property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| Come to the Fourth of July party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| Sure, if it's on private property or public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| I mean, what Ann was talking about is in regards to public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| So if this were, kind of thing, you know, the food truck celebration at the Southern Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7138)|
| 1:59:09| I'd like to recognize Ms. Ryder on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| Right ahead, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Lauren Ryder, 229 East Scott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| I did not come here to speak on this, but Councilman DelVolpe brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| He specifically mentioned the Forth and Gill banners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| Old North Knoxville has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| We paid for them with a neighborhood small grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7166)|
| 1:59:32| And they were not gone through any permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| I'm ratting us out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| They're permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| They're not about a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| I hope they're grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| I just want to point out that that's what DelVolpe is speaking of is we have these banners all over the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| in the public right-of-way, hung on these poles, and we spent a lot of money on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| And they're becoming more common as people want to celebrate their locale, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| We use them essentially as markers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| They mark the entrances to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| We have them at all our entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| I realize that is apparently controversial now, but I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| I mean, when you guys are regulating things, I hope that that's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| I know there was another neighborhood that might have just applied for a small grant to purchase these same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7211)|
| 2:00:18| So that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| I don't want to keep you here until 5 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| We'll keep it down to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| What tells them they go to special events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Okay, our law departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Where are we on this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| The street banner thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| The banner's on poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| We're in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| Did that get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| Ann says you go to special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| If you look here, it says they're exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| So how do you know what to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| And these are for an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| And I think the street banner signs are not necessarily for an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| So I don't know if we need to create a separate category for those if we want to exempt those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| I mean, I think there's several considerations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| I mean, I think we started out with when is the start time that we're going to let these banners and buntings go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7263)|
| 2:01:12| But the street signs, it sounds like, maybe aren't addressed by special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| or maybe they weren't addressed when these were installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| I'm not sure when the Forth and Gill ones were installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| I don't know if they – I know that they change their policies pretty frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| So I don't know what the current regulation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7289)|
| 2:01:39| Well, that will be something we'll ask NPC to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| So you're going to pass on 22 right now, but try and see what the special events rules are and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7305)|
| 2:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| About number 23, what were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| Covered later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| Covered later, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| Sorry, I would like to make a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| When I said we were going to cover it later, I was talking about the conflict that Ms. Malone was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| that they're exempt here but you have to get a permit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| I don't know if she had any other additional items on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| but that's what I was referring to as far as getting to it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| There is an additional thing, and that is, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7353)|
| 2:02:40| this does not address nameplate signs or whatever for units at multifamily dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7360)|
| 2:02:47| which I think it ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| In other words, if you have six attached dwellings or ten condos in a building or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7369)|
| 2:03:07| it's one sign per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| It ought to be dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| If you look at 23A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7392)|
| 2:03:20| because most condo associations want you at least to have your condo number outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| so in case 911 is called, they know who's where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| And this says lot, not dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| What do you say, Kristen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Is that something that needs to be changed from the law department first, I guess, I would ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| I think that change is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| So per dwelling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| So 23A would say one sign per dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| Anything else on Section 4, signs exempt from regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| Okay, now Section 5, signs exempt from permit requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7456)|
| 2:04:30| Anything that needs to be pointed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| I want to call on Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Joyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| This refers to Numbers 1 through 4 and Number 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| They have to do with real estate signs and construction signs and then temporary auction signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| And these signs were never discussed in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| Apparently Mr. Donaldson met with the Realtors Association in his office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| and had one meeting with them, and then as a result he doubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| and sometimes tripled the sign sizes and sign heights in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| But it was never even discussed in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| So what I would like to see, what Scenic Knoxville would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| is the numbers be restored to what is in the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| So for Number 1, residential districts, 9 square feet should be restored to 6 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7527)|
| 2:05:35| with a maximum height of 4 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| And I don't think there should be a wall sign allowed in the residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| but if there is, there should be a maximum size specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| And then for Number 2, 64 feet should be restored to 16 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| with a maximum height of 6 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| And wall signs should have a maximum size specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| For Number 3, 9 square feet should be restored to 6 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| with a maximum height of 4 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| For construction, 64 feet should be restored to 32 square feet with a maximum of 8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7571)|
| 2:06:19| And then Number 6, temporary auction signs, 31 days should be restored to 17 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7579)|
| 2:06:27| And 24 square feet with a maximum of 6 feet in a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7587)|
| 2:06:33| And 32 square feet with a maximum height of 8 feet in all other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| Why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| I'd like to call on Jennifer Roach, who's the governmental affairs for the Knoxville Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| My Jennifer Roach, 8008 Westcliff Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| I met with Mark Donaldson on March 4th of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| and brought to him a few dozen interviews I had completed with residential and commercial realtors and auctioneers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7620)|
| 2:07:10| and brought him our industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| And the numbers that are in there are very close to our industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| We're heavily regulated by the Tennessee Real Estate Commission and by our franchises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| And our assigned suppliers produce a few standard sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| and so he basically codified our industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| And I can make those a bit clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7653)|
| 2:07:40| With all due respect to Mr. Donaldson and all the work that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| the numbers that he said he put in here were taken from other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| and not referenced to anyone in our industry locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| So in paragraph one, the six feet in height covers the highest signs that we see in the residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7675)|
| 2:08:05| which are about five and a half feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| Those include the Century 21 gold post signs and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| The nine square feet covers our signs, which are in two widths, 24 inches or 36 inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7691)|
| 2:08:22| and two heights of the main sign size, 24 inches or 18 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| And there are assigned riders that go with that, which are the same width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| and either six or eight inches in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| I do have some photos if you'd like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| Excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| Are those the standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Those are the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| Are you giving us the standards now that you need to go by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| The standard widths are two or three feet, and the maximum height that we usually see in those are two to three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7727)|
| 2:08:58| So nine square feet covers the 36 inches by 36 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| And on the post signs, that covers those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7743)|
| 2:09:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| Number two, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| The standard four by eight piece of plywood is used many times, which gives us the 32 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7759)|
| 2:09:27| which was the original number that was in the draft that I was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7767)|
| 2:09:36| The 64 square feet would cover riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| There's usually a rider with the agent's name on top, something about the property on bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| which would add another two feet to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| So the 64 square feet, I think, covers all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| 32 feet, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| 32 square feet covers the main sign, which has the brokerage name and everything in there, like the brokerage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| Two more for the little add-on, so that's 34 feet, not 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| It would be a foot on top and a foot on bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| The 64 square feet has some leeway in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| That was, I think maybe that was a number that when we were talking about signs where you see them that are less than 90 degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7816)|
| 2:10:28| where you have the signs together like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| But my knowledge now is that that's all considered just one sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| and so something in the middle of 48 square feet would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7837)|
| 2:10:45| Change that to 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| 64 goes to 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| About the height, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| The height of 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Is that too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| Most of the signs that we see in the city in commercial districts or non-residential districts are at least 6 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7857)|
| 2:11:07| Most of them are around 7 or 8 feet high, so there is some leverage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| So if you said 8, that should be enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| 8 feet in height and 48 square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| 48 feet would allow for the two one-foot riders and a 4 by 8 main sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| 3 and 4 I have no comments on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Those were just construction signs, and they may have been changed for consistency in the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7891)|
| 2:11:42| That would be a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| For real estate open houses, I don't know if there was a question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7905)|
| 2:11:54| And then for auction signs, auction signs to have a full month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| The 17 days that was in there was just put in there because that was something that was seen in other city regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| from my information from Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| In my interviews with a number of our realtors slash auctioneers, they requested a full month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| They do a full month of advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| That's all they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| They don't get a full listing like when you list a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| They don't get months and months on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| All they have are those signs for that month, and that's a big driver of their traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7943)|
| 2:12:30| That's very important for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| What signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7951)|
| 2:12:39| Is the 16 square feet too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| Is 8 too little?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| In the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| The 4 by 8, the 32 square feet is what we would request, the 4 by 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7965)|
| 2:12:54| And then the 10 feet high in residential areas should come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| That could be the 8 like the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| And I would also say we are a self-regulating industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7986)|
| 2:13:13| and we would request in number 5 with the real estate open houses that they would be removed the day of the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=7993)|
| 2:13:23| not two days after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| We don't like to see those up afterwards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| Removed within one day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8012)|
| 2:13:45| Is there anything else, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| If I can answer any questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| Well, hold on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| I mean, she's spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| The other side has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| I mean, if we don't move forward, we're never going to get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| I mean, that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| Whatever counsel wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| Okay, so what we have right now is, who's making that motion with those changes that have just been discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8045)|
| 2:14:12| I have on number 2, so section 5, number 2, on non-residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8052)|
| 2:14:20| they go from 64 square feet down to 48 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| And 8 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| All right, 8 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| What do you have on number 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| Number 1, it stayed the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| Make the motion on number 2, 48 square feet and 8 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| Okay, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| That passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Okay, then on number 3, I think she didn't recommend any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| That was construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| It's the same as 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| It should be whatever 1 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| Ms. Feld said shorter, and she said whatever 1 is is good for 3, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8107)|
| 2:15:14| I think Ms. Feld recommended, or who spoke, was it Ms. Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8114)|
| 2:15:19| The present ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| It was an existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| Are you all recommending any changes on 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| It now says on section 5, number 1, it now says 9 square feet, not to exceed 6 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8131)|
| 2:15:41| I think she said 6 feet square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| Is that what she said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| 6 and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| 6 and 4 was what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| Is there an industry on that somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| That's what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| That's what you see a lot of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| Numbers that are typed in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| 9 and 6 are what you see out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| What the realtors are asking, they're saying a standard, what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| There's some lower, but that's as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| I've never heard very many complaints about signs that are listing a house for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| They're temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| I mean, these things don't stay up, hopefully, forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Number 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| Number 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| I think the next one was on number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| And adding, instead of being removed within two days, make it be removed within one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| If you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| Is there a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| Make a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| We have a motion and a second, and that is to, on number 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| the temporary signs for yard sales and open houses, that they are removed within one day after the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| I think also on number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| Number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| Number 4, it also, the 10 feet could be reduced to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| So I make a motion we reduce 10 feet to 8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| I think 64 could be 48, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| It's a counterpart to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| It's construction versus real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| Yeah, I don't believe Ms. Roach spoke on this, because it was the construction sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| And I did want to add, if you all have your color-coded version handy, it shows what Ms. Feld was referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| It's on page 12 of the color-coded version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| It shows what it had been previously, just for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8245)|
| 2:17:41| Yeah, I don't think she did either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| Well, typically what you see on number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| What you see on number 4, they'll take a 4 by 8 sheet of plywood and make an announcement sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| stair holla, 48 lots, name it, you know, a drawing, and name the realtor and the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8274)|
| 2:18:01| And that's how you get a 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| 64 is two sheets of 4 by 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| Sometimes those are two like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| I mean, they either are double-sided or, you know, are angled in such a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8291)|
| 2:18:16| And they usually are 8 or 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| Then you take a 4 by 8 and take it 2 feet up off the ground and get it up out of the dirt, and that's how you get 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| So, I mean, it's plausible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| Again, these are usually temporary, and the permanent sign goes up for the subdivision, and that sign comes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| So are you saying leave it or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| I'd rather leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| I'm for leaving 4 like it is, but that's what a temporary construction sign, that's what you see out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8317)|
| 2:18:43| They may be up for a couple years, but they do eventually come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| Okay, so on number 4, there are no amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| I would amend it to 48 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| Okay, we have a motion and a second to amend it to 48 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8346)|

| 2:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| Okay, that passes 5 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| It stays the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| Yes, now 48 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8375)|

| 2:19:38| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| Do you want to revote on that, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| No, let MPC look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| We've got some numbers in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| These are not the big problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| Temporary signs are not killing anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8385)|

| 2:20:12| There had been some different discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| 31 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| I think she said 8 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| She did say, I think, it could be 8 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| I move we move it to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| Okay, this would be on the temporary auction signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| that it would not exceed 8 feet in height rather than the 10 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| Passes 7 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| Okay, so section 5, anything more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| Signs exempt from permit requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| Anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| Okay, we're on section 6, criteria for measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| Anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| There's a technical person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Let's say you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| Margo Klein, 481 Broom Road, Knoxville, 37909, which is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8474)|
| 2:21:22| I have a question on section 6, 2A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| And I don't have the whole thing in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| But that area, the way it's written now is kind of Pandora's box because the words or highest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8489)|
| 2:21:44| whichever is highest, were stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| And that leaves just too much in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8507)|
| 2:21:52| If you start measuring from the base of the sign and the sign's going up a hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8512)|
| 2:21:58| that means that the sign can be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| And it might actually be 20 feet when the restriction's 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| But the guy whose land goes down in a hole can only go 10 feet above the grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| So most ordinances use terminology like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| Height, the maximum permitted height for ground sign shall be measured from the level of the center line of the adjacent street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| to the highest point of the highest element of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| And that doesn't, that leaves, you know, no area for questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| The other area, the other concern here is 6-2A or 6-2B, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8551)|
| 2:22:44| The finished grade of the property is exclusive of the filling or berming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8564)|
| 2:22:51| that's done primarily for the purpose of locating a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| That's very ambiguous because we had a situation at Cheryl Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| where the entire property at the front was bermed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| and the buildings were put on the top of the berm and the sign was put on top of the berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| So that would be legal according to the way this is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| And I really think what you're going to end up with are merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| who will grade their land to build it up so that you're going to have tunnels going down streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| so that people can have their buildings and their signs up on top of these berms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| So it's just, it's really important to measure from the center line of the adjacent street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8615)|
| 2:23:43| Chairman, what say you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| Well, I'll say that we spent a lot of time talking about that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| And, right, Dwayne, I mean, we spent a lot of time talking about where you measure that from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| And that comes up under each one of the sections because if you have a road here and here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| then you get to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| If you're down in a hole, like there's a place caught on, I guess it's, where's the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8641)|
| 2:24:08| You know what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| I can't think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| Well, I think it exists all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| And really you have the BZA to come back to if you have a hardship case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| and you're in a hole and, you know, you need to build a berm, as she says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| I mean, I think that's, you've got options for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| Or you have, if your elevation, if your lot is here and the road is up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| you measure from this point for your, whatever the height of the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| so that the sign can get up to that height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| Yeah, we spent quite a bit of time discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| And really, this is, I mean, it's just hard to define it for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| That's kind of what we came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| So are you comfortable with what we had, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| We were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| I am, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| I'm comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| Our topography doesn't make it perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8690)|
| 2:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Any other discussion from council on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| So we're moving on on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| Section 6.5, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| Please talk into your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| Section 6.5, I don't know why we're measuring the vertical surface of the canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| as opposed to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| You have gas stations like, for instance, the new one at Kroger's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| It just has the very small, little place where you pay for the gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| And so what we were allowing them to do is to allow that part of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| but also allow the canopy, which the canopy is really the main part of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| And so that's why that was discussed at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| This is the structure over the pump itself, the canopy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| Yes, the canopy, the definition of canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| Does that answer your question, Councilman Velvepe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| I think Ms. Malone has an additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| I understand where you have small, since we're going from sign size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| attached sign size being computed based on street frontage to attached sign size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8764)|
| 2:26:12| being based on the elevation, I call it the wall of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| the square footage of the building without the parapet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| But since we're going to that, building size controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| front wall size controls the size of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| Now, I understand when you have small operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| there may be a need for a minimum sign allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| such as the photo mat kind of thing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| But what you're doing here is you have absolutely no limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| So one can exaggerate that vertical canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| and greatly increase the size of their wall sign, of their attached sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8815)|
| 2:27:01| It doesn't say up to so much or canopy up to so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| or one length of the canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| It could be the entire perimeter of the canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8829)|
| 2:27:14| and you could have one 10 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| Big one, big tall vertical thing of 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8837)|
| 2:27:22| So my suggestion would be, and let's face it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| there are small convenience stores that don't have gas pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| So they don't get the benefit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| They're penalized compared to their competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| So I would suggest we come up with a minimum size for real small buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| And let's not mess around with canopies or not canopies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| or gas pumps or not gas pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| If we want to let small businesses with small walls have a sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8866)|
| 2:27:50| let's come up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| Council, would you take any action on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| Yeah, I think we need to ask the MPC to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| Got that, Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| This is on 6.5, right, canopies over gasoline pumps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| Is there a way when we refer this to them in the final vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| that we say take a special look at X or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| Does that need to be part of a motion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| If you're referring things for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| hopefully you will give some direction as to what it is you specifically want us to examine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8911)|
| 2:28:38| And then that way we can look at those alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| and provide alternatives back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| I think part of the problem, I mean, this really shows some of the turmoil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| that the assigned task force came up with, and, George, you can chime in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| You know, we can go through this whole thing and go what if, what if, what if, what if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| And what we tried to do was to kind of be, I guess you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| not necessarily middle of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| but we tried to look at as many situations as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| And this is probably an example of where we have not been privy to a lot of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| that have come up over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8952)|
| 2:29:13| I understand, Carlene, what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| and I understand that we're trying to come up with the best possible situation that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| But I think also that if we go back, we can almost say what if on almost all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| What if something like this happens or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| And so I don't know, you know, again, how far are we in the weeds and the bushes on this kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8968)|
| 2:29:36| If council feels that this is a certain problem that Carlene has brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8976)|
| 2:29:41| I think what we do is we ask MPC to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| George, do you have some thought on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| I don't think it's an overwhelmingly, you know, out of control issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| I mean, it's a, you know, I mean, if you want to have MPC give a recommendation on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| we can make a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| But I don't think it's that, you know, but that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| We've got a speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| I think we make a motion to have MPC take a look at 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| Mayor, I'd like to hear from the gentleman at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| Yes, here from the other side here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9014)|
| 2:30:15| Yeah, Mike Campbell, 458 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| If I can remind you guys the reason why you put that in was to clarify a gas canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| is a parapet around the entire perimeter typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| And so that allows that because the previous exemption or the previous paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| exempts that parapet from being allowed as part of the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| So the reason is a gas canopy is a total parapet typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| and so it allows that to be counted towards the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| Is there anything else that I can answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| In other words, you exempt the wall sign area previously to not include the parapet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9052)|
| 2:30:59| so that they don't do what this lady said, and that is exaggerate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| because you cannot use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| But on a gas canopy, typically the whole thing is a parapet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| So that's the reason why I think it was put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| If I could just respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9075)|
| 2:31:16| One of the reasons you haven't had problems with this in the past is in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| you went attach signs, not wall signs, attach signs, which include wall signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| was based on the street frontage, not the parapet, not the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| So to say we haven't had problems with this in the past, of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| Signs weren't based on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| They were based on something entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| I would like to go back to the suggestion that we send this to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| to have them consider all of the issues that have been addressed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| so that we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| I think we did have a motion and a second on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| We had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| Okay, is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9118)|
| 2:31:59| The motion is to send this, and I think, Mr. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| you heard the different issues related to this, correct, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9121)|
| 2:32:08| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9128)|
| 2:32:13| I think I understand what the charge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9137)|
| 2:32:18| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| Well, so we're going to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9139)|
| 2:32:24| It's part of the whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| All of this is going to MPC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| So, I mean, you all, you accepted it, and apparently, from what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9152)|
| 2:32:40| there was a lot of discussion, you vetted it, and you approved it as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| So I don't know why we are taxing, we're not taxing MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| but why would we be sending it back to MPC when you all obviously vetted this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| and it was accepted by the majority, I assume, of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9176)|
| 2:33:02| I don't know why we send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| All we're doing is saying to MPC, pay special attention to 6.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| and give us your recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| I mean, you're going to give us your recommendations anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| but we're asking you for special consideration of that one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9193)|
| 2:33:17| Maybe we should add to that, is it properly limited or qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| or is there anything else to be added to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| Or throw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| I'm fine with the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| They could leave it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| Okay, so there is a motion to have MPC look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| If you're fine the way it is, then vote no on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| If you want to open this up for discussion and perhaps changing, then you'd vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9214)|
| 2:33:38| You'd be asking MPC to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| So let's, why don't we do, I'm predicting a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9230)|
| 2:33:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9234)|
| 2:33:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9242)|
| 2:34:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9243)|
| 2:34:04| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9245)|
| 2:34:06| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9247)|
| 2:34:08| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9248)|
| 2:34:09| Okay, it fails, so it stays as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9252)|
| 2:34:13| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| 6.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Ready for 7, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| Anything on 6.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9261)|
| 2:34:22| 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| We're almost halfway through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| General sign standards and requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| Anything on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| Section 8, standards for specific sign types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9274)|
| 2:34:47| Mayor, if I could ask just a point of clarification to the task force chiefs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| Please speak closer to your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9292)|
| 2:34:53| I'd like to ask a point of clarification to the task force chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| There was some indication that we didn't do enough for landmark or historic signs, but I see you have it covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9295)|
| 2:35:02| Is there something that's an issue but not resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| I don't know what you would add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| There's a historic sign section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| Yeah, it's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| It's covered in 8.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| 8.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9318)|
| 2:35:19| It goes on for three pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| Y'all don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| No problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| So we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| Anything else on Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| Look through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| Section 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Mayor, I have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| And this was a conflict that I noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| If you all will go to 8.2D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9337)|
| 2:35:47| 8.2D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| No temporary sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9349)|
| 2:35:50| No temporary sign shall exceed 32 square feet in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| When the temporary signs that we were talking about earlier were modified in size, I think this didn't get changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| So I would just like to request or recommend, rather, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| What was it, 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9364)|
| 2:36:05| What's the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9365)|
| 2:36:06| I think we, did we change the model to 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Are there still, I think there's still 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| There are some that are 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| That's a good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| So you're just plugging in the right number, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| So this has to do with the, you're referring back to 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9381)|
| 2:36:28| Yeah, Section 5 that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| Section 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| So that should be what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| There are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9395)|
| 2:36:47| We're just conforming it to what we already talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9410)|
| 2:36:51| And this wouldn't be, you know, this provision isn't saying all temporary signs can be 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| This is just saying where temporary signs are indicated otherwise in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| section sets out some items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| So if the provision specifically says it can only be 16, 32, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9424)|
| 2:37:11| then that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9431)|
| 2:37:12| But in no instance could it exceed 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| Is that what you want language to say it can't exceed 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| That would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| I'll make a motion we amend that to say it can't exceed 48 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| Second, if there hasn't been a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| It says 8.2D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9456)|
| 2:37:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| All right, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| Anything else on Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| We're ripping through 8 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| Anything else on 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| Section 9, Master Sign Plans for Unified Developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9473)|
| 2:38:04| Are you going to tell us something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| Is there anything, Ms. Fell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| Go ahead, Ms. Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9490)|
| 2:38:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9491)|
| 2:38:12| This is F, Section F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| 9.2, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| Section 9, Master Sign Plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9501)|
| 2:38:27| I think my page numbers are different than yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| For me, this is on page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| Is it 9.2F, application requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| No, this is 9.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| Development directory sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| Development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| So this was allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| EMCs were banned, and then the Turkey Creek developers came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| and wanted to be able to put up an EMC as a directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9542)|
| 2:39:10| And council wrote the law basically for Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9550)|
| 2:39:14| I mean, you can see it's pretty specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| It has to be at least 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| It's not 200 feet on an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| And Turkey Creek has their electronic message sign now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| and I'd just like to say that it's not in compliance with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9565)|
| 2:39:31| And I guess the city hasn't made them anyway or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| I don't know, comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9576)|
| 2:39:37| But they have their EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| This law was written just for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| We don't know what the likelihood is of there being another development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| that would meet these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| But since it's a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| I would just like to request that this section be deleted in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| so that there can be we have a ban on EMCs in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| and I just don't think we should be making exceptions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| We should just keep the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| Sign gods, do you have any advice for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| Move to delete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9615)|
| 2:40:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| Motion to delete 9.4 in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| No, F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| I mean 9.4 subsection F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9625)|
| 2:40:29| Right, okay, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| Lawyer, do you have anything to tell us on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9632)|
| 2:40:37| I think the only thing I would add is that the Turkey Creek sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| to the extent that it's legal, would be a non-conforming sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| So that one would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9644)|
| 2:40:45| It stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| We don't affect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9651)|
| 2:40:52| I guess if a special case comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| it could go for a variance or something and fight it out then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| But it doesn't seem to have general application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9657)|
| 2:41:02| Okay, the motion is to delete 9.4 F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| Three no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| Raise your hand if you're no, just to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9676)|
| 2:41:17| Okay, so that passes 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| We done with 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9682)|
| 2:41:23| We must be done with 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Anything else on Section 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| I mean Section 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| We're done with 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| 10, signs permitted in all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| I have a comment here, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| This is what Ms. Malone was referring to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9702)|
| 2:41:47| This language that I've highlighted here on your screens after the clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| removing that would eliminate the conflict that she was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9711)|
| 2:41:56| And I agree with her that that does create a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| And I think that's a reasonable recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| Move to strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| My only question is when we do that, what about the other pieces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| Are we affecting something that we don't know about right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| We're going from sounds are reliable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| and we're taking out requiring an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9743)|
| 2:42:30| Hearing nothing, I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9750)|
| 2:42:43| You're fine with that, Krista and Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| You don't see any issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9765)|
| 2:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| Do we need a permit for these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| So the motion on section 10 is to strike, as shown on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9770)|
| 2:42:56| the first sentence, the last part of the first sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9776)|
| 2:43:00| Is there any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9787)|
| 2:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| Anything else on section 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| Before we get into section 11, which I think is the main course of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9796)|
| 2:43:22| do you think we should have a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| Take another quick break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9806)|
| 2:43:27| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| Very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| Councilman Grieve, do you want to explain what you've handed out here to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9815)|
| 2:43:41| What I've handed out is the table shows the different zones that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| the different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9825)|
| 2:43:46| It shows you the height of the monument or column sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| also the ground or pole sign, and then the wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| And so what you'll see down through there is what is recommended in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9833)|
| 2:43:59| for each one of the particular zones because, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| our signs are regulated by zones, and that's what this shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| And it pretty well, I think we have to thank Krista for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| It covers all the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| Right, Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| Caught her with her mouth full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9859)|
| 2:44:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| So that's the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| So as we go along and look at these different sections in 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| you can actually see the graph is the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| So this reflects what we have in the ordinance before us, just summarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| So Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| What is proposed in there is 40 feet within commercial zones primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9882)|
| 2:44:49| That's the ones we're talking about primarily on the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| It's 40 feet within 500 feet of the interstate and 30 feet everywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9892)|
| 2:44:59| with no distinction on road or anything else, just purely by zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9899)|
| 2:45:06| And what I propose is that we determine sign height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9906)|
| 2:45:11| and sign area by road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| And that was the way it was originally presented to us from NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| And you have that buried somewhere in your stack of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| So NPC originally said 500 feet of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| They made that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| Then they said within adjacent to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| And then they said federal highways and all other roads is the way they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9934)|
| 2:45:45| I would propose it to be a little bit different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| NPC has a major road plan for the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| It's posted on their website, and I've put it on the form for you to pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| Every street is listed, and their definitions are in here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| They define interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| They define major and minor arterial and major and minor collector road and local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9963)|
| 2:46:09| I think that signs ought to be regulated by the road classification they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| And this is the way it was originally presented from NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| that faster moving traffic would require a taller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9976)|
| 2:46:22| Interstate up against the interstate, and that's why we have it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9982)|
| 2:46:25| 500 feet of the interstate ought to have a taller sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| so it can be seen when you're driving by at the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| Is this 11.6 primarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| All in 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| All of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| Like I said, only commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| Well, it's in 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| I mean, this is how we're going to define sign height in 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| In office zones, in 11C, commercial, industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| I think one of the things that we can do is we can go ahead and get the other ones out of the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| the residential and those areas in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| That's fine, but I mean I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| Because we're not talking 30 feet all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| We're only talking in those particular zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10025)|
| 2:47:06| I totally understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| I totally get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| 30 feet is a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| I just want to make clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| Let's be real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| It's 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| Read it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| I've got it, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| It's 40 feet within 500 feet of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| And 30 feet everywhere else in the commercial zone, C1, C2, C3, C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10047)|
| 2:47:28| And industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10048)|
| 2:47:29| And industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10049)|
| 2:47:30| So everywhere there's C1, C2, C3, C4 and industrial, it's 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| Maximum is 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| No matter the road that it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| And that's what the sign task force voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| Excuse me, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| I'm talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10064)|
| 2:47:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| And I'm proposing that we amend this to put it by road classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10066)|
| 2:47:52| and that we can define what those roads are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| MPC has defined what those roads are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| It's not arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| Somebody comes for a zoning and they know what their zoning is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| you would be able to easily identify it on the map, tell you what street it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10082)|
| 2:48:07| That tells you the height of your zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| And it tells you the height of your sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| So on roads that maximum height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| All heights are maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| All heights are maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| I mean, so the idea is that on your streets that cut through your neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| that start out residential and go through commercial and industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| and end up back residential, those signs can still be 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| And in many cases they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| And I think that it's not protecting our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| and it's not really in the spirit of the law or really what people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10119)|
| 2:48:45| And that's what I would amend it that we look at sign height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10125)|
| 2:48:51| and sign area determined by road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| Within 500 feet of the interstate is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| Adjacent to the interstate is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| And break it down to major and minor arterial roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| and major and minor collector roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| And then local streets are all streets that are not named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| How was it changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| What are the new heights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10149)|
| 2:49:10| Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| Well, we can talk about what those heights are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| It's a different approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| The approach from looking at all the different criterion zones versus streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| This is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| And we spend a lot of time talking about the sign task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| And it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| You're going to get into the weeds on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| And, you know, we can talk about what those heights ought to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| but you've got to agree to the, you know, you've got to get to the concept first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10171)|
| 2:49:34| If that's what you, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| Otherwise it's 30 feet maximum everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| And I think that is, it's really not reflective of what we're trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10180)|
| 2:49:47| We have office zones across the street from industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| So I know of two issues we've had before council on my four years here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10190)|
| 2:49:55| where the zoning was purposefully changed for one reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| and that was to get taller signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| One of them was Wallace Memorial Baptist Church on Merchants Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10201)|
| 2:50:07| I think they were zoned office or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| They wanted it zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| They could have a taller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| The other one was a dialysis clinic on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| They were zoned office and went to C2, C3 because they wanted a bigger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10213)|
| 2:50:19| And this would take care of those issues that come before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| that you can just determine by the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| And if it's Magnolia, that's a major arterial road, and it would have a certain sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10226)|
| 2:50:31| So I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| Now you can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| So did you make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| That would be the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| That's the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| Okay, we've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10240)|
| 2:50:41| Discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| Yeah, I still want someone to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10242)|
| 2:50:44| Maybe it's fallen to Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10244)|
| 2:50:46| Why are we using zone districts as opposed to street types?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10246)|
| 2:50:50| I remember back in, I guess it was 2011 in November when we were wrestling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10250)|
| 2:50:57| We picked, we fought over the heights and we started out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| and we adopted a regulation that used the four different road types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10260)|
| 2:51:05| And then it went to the task force and then MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| So what's the justification for the way it's presented in 11.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10269)|
| 2:51:14| Because that's the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| Road type or zone type, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10279)|
| 2:51:20| And, George, chime in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| At our, gosh, it was the July 23, 2014 meeting, several motions were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10283)|
| 2:51:30| In fact, George made a motion to go to road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| We had some amendments to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| It was voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| Lower your mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10300)|
| 2:51:43| Then we also, we finally ended up, after working through several scenarios on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10303)|
| 2:51:49| we did end up with a vote to approve, and it was approved, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10309)|
| 2:52:00| The motion carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| But, I mean, rationale-wise, why do you like this better than the existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| I think one of the concerns that came up was the fact that if you have property on a certain side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| and then you have the side roads coming off of that, how do you deal with those streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10334)|
| 2:52:20| that are really adjacent to that as opposed to what the zone is already collected on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10340)|
| 2:52:27| Let's let Mr. Weigel speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| Bill Weigel, 7104 Hickory Hills Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10349)|
| 2:52:34| I'm one of the unlucky business retailers on the sign committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10354)|
| 2:52:39| We do have a neighborhood commercial zone that takes care of this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| It is a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| It's called commercial neighborhood or neighborhood commercial, and signs are limited by zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10368)|
| 2:52:54| If you don't limit signs by zone, you get some very unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10374)|
| 2:53:01| If you're talking about major roads and minor roads, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10381)|
| 2:53:07| the Baptist Church, I think, is on Merchant's Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10387)|
| 2:53:11| and Merchant's Road is an entirely commercially developed road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10391)|
| 2:53:17| Their zoning might not have been commercial, but it was certainly a commercial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10397)|
| 2:53:23| If you go up Cedar Lane, there are motels all the way up to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| I'm sure they're not zoned commercial when they strip off a road 300 yards to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10409)|
| 2:53:41| and that motel could not have a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| Zoning tells you what type of business it is, and zoning can tell you what kind of sign should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10424)|
| 2:53:52| There are unintended consequences that sound something so simple, and I wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10432)|
| 2:53:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150409?start=10439)|
