| 4:45:44| Yes, just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17144)|
| 4:45:46| My client, Mr. Baker, took this project over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17146)|
| 4:45:48| when it was set vacant for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17148)|
| 4:45:52| He's improved the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17152)|
| 4:45:53| and the infrastructure was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17153)|
| 4:45:56| The street these proposed units are being built on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17156)|
| 4:45:59| is already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17159)|
| 4:46:02| We're working with the county and with TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17162)|
| 4:46:04| for the proper permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17164)|
| 4:46:05| and the use on review approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17165)|
| 4:46:07| is what's required for us to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17167)|
| 4:46:10| for him to build these 10 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17170)|
| 4:46:14| All right, is there a staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17174)|
| 4:46:17| that would like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17177)|
| 4:46:24| Is there a staff member that reviewed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17184)|
| 4:46:25| that would like to give us any information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17185)|
| 4:46:28| Me and Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17188)|
| 4:46:31| Mike, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17191)|
| 4:46:35| All right, I guess we can open it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17195)|
| 4:46:38| to any commissioners that have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17198)|
| 4:46:41| for the applicant or wanna say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17201)|
| 4:46:44| I'd like to make a motion we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17204)|
| 4:46:45| the use on review for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17205)|
| 4:46:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17209)|
| 4:46:50| Okay, I got, who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17210)|
| 4:46:53| Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17213)|
| 4:46:54| Okay, Chris Souton made the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17214)|
| 4:46:57| and Lou Browning with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17217)|
| 4:47:01| Scott, you have some hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17221)|
| 4:47:03| Would anybody like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17223)|
| 4:47:10| It looks like you're not having your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17230)|
| 4:47:12| Nope, nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17232)|
| 4:47:13| Yeah, I do, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17233)|
| 4:47:14| I have my hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17234)|
| 4:47:15| Okay, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17235)|
| 4:47:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17237)|
| 4:47:18| Hey, and Scott, good job just taking the reins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17238)|
| 4:47:21| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17241)|
| 4:47:23| I had one question that the applicant's representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17243)|
| 4:47:29| just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17249)|
| 4:47:29| He said 10 units and the application says nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17249)|
| 4:47:34| Oh, they did remove one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17254)|
| 4:47:37| I'm sorry, it is nine units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17257)|
| 4:47:38| because we were a few decimals short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17258)|
| 4:47:40| of having the area for the 10th unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17260)|
| 4:47:42| Okay, thank you for answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17262)|
| 4:47:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17264)|
| 4:47:45| No, no, no worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17265)|
| 4:47:47| The other one is I believe that the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17267)|
| 4:47:52| is saying that they're encouraging us to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17272)|
| 4:47:56| if the landscaping items are addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17276)|
| 4:48:01| that were not ever addressed with the first developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17281)|
| 4:48:05| And that's a real concern of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17285)|
| 4:48:06| that these were never addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17286)|
| 4:48:08| So we're being asked to approve more units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17288)|
| 4:48:10| yet the original plan was never finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17290)|
| 4:48:14| So I just want to say that for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17294)|
| 4:48:17| because I do think that that's a very important component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17297)|
| 4:48:20| and will help the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17300)|
| 4:48:22| for all the residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17302)|
| 4:48:24| And I think that's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17304)|
| 4:48:27| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17307)|
| 4:48:29| My developer was not the original developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17309)|
| 4:48:31| He took this project over when a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17311)|
| 4:48:35| he'd been sitting dormant for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17315)|
| 4:48:36| and he took it from the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17316)|
| 4:48:38| So he's made many improvements there already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17318)|
| 4:48:42| and intends to make more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17322)|
| 4:48:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17324)|
| 4:48:46| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17326)|
| 4:48:49| I guess Steve Wise, would you like to call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200813?start=17329)|
