| 0:00:30| So I will call this meeting to order and ask Councilman George Wallace to return to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=30)|
| 0:00:40| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=47)|
| 0:00:57| Thank you. Now I'll ask Mr. Johnson to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=57)|

| 0:01:12| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Councilman Welch. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=76)|
| 0:01:18| This, as I said a moment ago, is the workshop on the zoning code regarding residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| I do want to make a few remarks before we get started, and you'll see the agenda on the screen in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=85)|
| 0:01:33| First item is update on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| There's been a lot of questions about that, and, in fact, I still have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| But here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| We are going to have another workshop, but because of the way that these two workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=101)|
| 0:01:49| this one and the one a couple of weeks ago regarding industrial, commercial, and office, have fallen out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| I think Mr. Green has chosen to wait until all the comments are received from us on these two workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| and then you'll produce the fifth edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| That's correct, and I spoke with our consultants today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| We will work, depending on the number of comments we have, we'll give them all the comments by the middle of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| There will be some iterations for the staff draft where we'll review their revisions as staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=142)|
| 0:02:30| Then the draft will be available for the public by the ides of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| The ides of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Well, that will be the second week of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| And then, of course, following that, we will have a spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| We're not going to meet during that spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| That might eliminate some voices that we might need to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| So we will schedule the next workshop following the receipt of the fifth draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| That may be the last week of March or in early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| So we're taking this thing a step at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| One other item that all my colleagues received this afternoon from the Deputy to the Mayor for Policy, Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=187)|
| 0:03:17| was a notice, a proposed notice to property owners, to all the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| Last time we talked quite a bit about how we might accomplish that, and this is the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Now, this will come to us, and this was not sent to you to wordsmith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| This was their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Mr. Green and Dr. Lyons worked extremely hard on this, and I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| They coordinated with me with some frequency, so we were aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| But this was something, obviously, that came up, and we responded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| So this will go out hopefully within a week, probably by the end of next week, and notify all the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| So far, so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| At this point, then, I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Green, and let's start the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| I'd like to thank you for this opportunity and once again state that this is not an effort that was undertaken by any one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| City Council directed Knoxville, Knox County Planning to work with the consultant and with city staff to undertake the update of our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=266)|
| 0:04:36| It's a significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Our existing zoning code is about 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| It does not allow the type of development that is envisioned by the City of Knoxville, that is wanted by a number of the residents, or is desired by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=282)|
| 0:04:54| The major challenge with this is it is change, and none of us are favorable to change, and finding that's certainly true here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=294)|
| 0:05:04| But I've had great assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Peter Ahrens, Director of City Plans Review and Inspections, has been by my side as we review this and at community meetings and received all the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=306)|
| 0:05:18| Our Planning Services Manager at Knoxville, Knox County Planning, who's sitting in the back, has been a big help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| Deanne and Lori with Peter's staff have been involved heavily throughout this, so it's certainly been a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| All the city staff, especially the legal staff, have been heavily involved from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| And as I noted at the last workshop, we've had over 80 public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| We've had now about 67,000 visits on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| I don't know, I've forgotten the number of email and map comments we've received, but well in the thousands during this two-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=346)|
| 0:05:55| I really appreciate the input of the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| It's given me a new appreciation of the diversity of our community based on the comments we've received, because there's been a wide diversity of comments, and you realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=360)|
| 0:06:10| Our greatest challenge is how to mesh those comments and coalesce them into a vision that meets the needs of all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| not any one sector of Knoxville, not any one neighborhood, not any one corridor, but the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| And that's a significant challenge for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| And in doing that, I see things every day that I think we could do better, but this is not my document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| This is the citizens of the city of Knoxville, and you as representatives of those citizens are charged with a significant task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| That's reviewing this and taking action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| So with that, I'll get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| And the first thing I have is basically the meeting overview, the agenda, and you saw that on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| But some of the things, one of the key things is I'm going to go through these quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| By this point, I think most people know what the residential standards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| I'd like to spend a good bit of time on the policy issues and, again, looking for policy direction from the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| not grammatical errors, not context errors, but broad policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| I've met with some of the council members and talked with some of you and will be happy to meet with you at any time to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| If you want to go word by word, that's fine, but let's do that in a forum that's more suitable for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| and deal with the major policy issues and some of the big issues we have to address at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| Peter will, again, be assisting me with some of the questions that I think all of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| but some of the people in the audience may not know that the Plans, Review, and Inspections Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| administers the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| They direct or are in charge of the day-to-day operation of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| dealing with its day-to-day use and working with a lot of citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| and Peter is the lead agent on that, so his task in this effort cannot be underestimated or underappreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=481)|
| 0:08:11| The goals of our proposed non-residential districts that we worked with from the beginning were to encourage investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| in our neighborhoods and protect the characteristics that define those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| respect the integrity of those vibrant neighborhoods, providing development for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| that's compatible with the neighborhoods, provide opportunities for a variety of housing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| from large lot single-family to townhomes to condos to apartments in various locations throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| and to create a hierarchy of districts that scale up in intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| As you know, our current residential districts, most of the single-family districts have the same lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| We wanted to get away from that and try to create and craft districts that were more suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| for the diverse neighborhoods of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| We have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I saw a comment today that we have the same number of zoning districts proposed in the new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| that we have in the old one, and I think that speaks to the diversity of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| That's not any failing on anyone's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| It speaks to the diversity of Knoxville, the fact that we don't have one template that fits the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| We need that diversity of zoning codes to address the diversity of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| We start with the residential districts and the number of residential districts we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| They're classified broadly as single-family, general residential, and multifamily residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| The established neighborhood district is for Knoxville's older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| These have been mapped and were created about 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| No changes have been made in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| There are design standards for the established neighborhoods, new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| and additions in the established neighborhoods, and that design review is through a staff review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| You are in one single-family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| It accommodates the traditional residential neighborhoods, the larger lot neighborhoods, usually with large setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| In this zoning district and the other single-family districts, duplexes are permitted with a special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| That special use review involves a review with public notice by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| The RN-2 single-family district accommodates single-family neighborhoods in relatively small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| The older neighborhoods, Fourth and Gill, Oakwood, Lincoln Park, Bell-Morris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| are examples of neighborhoods that could fit into the RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| Again, two-family dwellings are permitted with a special use permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| The general residential districts accommodate a wider diversity of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| The RN-3 general residential district is characterized by one- and two-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| It allows townhouse dwellings with a special use to facilitate a broader variety of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=649)|
| 0:10:58| The RN-4 general residential district is mixed residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| from single-family to duplex to small-scale multifamily and also townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| There's a new approach to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| A small-scale multifamily is permitted sometimes with staff review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| sometimes with a special review depending on the size of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| Up to 20 units is considered small-scale and is permitted in the RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| If it's more than four units per building or more than eight units in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| the review goes to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| If it's less than four units, four fewer units per building and less than eight units overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| the review is by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| There are some basic design standards for the multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| The small-scale multifamily would allow typical flats, townhomes, as well as pocket neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| a new approach to development in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| The RN-5 general residential neighborhood district accommodates those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| by heterogeneous, a real mix of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Some of our more older in-town neighborhoods may be appropriate for this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| Those areas where we want and desire a wide variety of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| This zone may serve as a transition between the one- and two-family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| and our more commercial mixed-use corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| The RN-6 multifamily residential neighborhood is a neighborhood accommodated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| by a variety of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| It permits up to 57 dwelling units per acre, which is a fairly intense residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| The RN-7 residential neighborhood is a new approach to multifamily zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| It only permits multifamily, no one-family or two-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| It's townhomes and multifamily only, and it's a significant density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| I'd like to note, once again, as we heard at our last workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| that residential development is permitted in all our commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| We have gone to a true mixed-use type of zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Going over the residential standards, the established residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| again, these standards are the same as they are in our existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| 22,000-square-foot minimum lot size, 100-foot minimum lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| generous setbacks based largely on the character of the existing neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| but not less than 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Maximum building height, 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| and we do have a limit on the maximum building coverage and impervious surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| And this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| These maximum building coverages are important to note when thinking about our accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| It was pointed out, actually, by one of the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| you could have an accessory building in some cases as large as your home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| but the challenge is that you're also in every district, residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| you are limited to a maximum building coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| And we'll get to that a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| I'll give you an example in the RN-2 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| With the RN-1, going on to the RN-1, minimum lot area is 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| 15,000 square feet for a duplex, minimum lot width 75 feet, again, fairly generous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| setbacks of 25 feet in front of the block face average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| You'll note that in all of these, our front setbacks, we work with block face averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| That's to try to mimic the character of the existing neighborhood instead of having a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| where maybe the homes built in the 1920s and 30s are close to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| and the new zoning code requires a 30-foot complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Gerald, you may want to pull that mic a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| We're having some interference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| And I'll try to speak louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| If you can't hear me or if anyone in the audience can't hear me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| please let me know and I'll speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| We're trying to, again, match the character of our existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| even with this approach to setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| In this zoning district, the maximum building coverage is 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| The RN-2 residential district is very similar to the RN-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| except it has smaller lot size, 5,000 square foot minimum lot size, 7,500 square feet for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| The minimum lot width is also reduced 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| The maximum building coverage stays at 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| So in this zoning district, no more than 1,500 square feet could be covered with buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| We've had comments that that may be too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| We've had comments that that's not enough, that it limits smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Again, the diversity of opinion in a diverse community and how do we address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| I think we try to hit on something that's reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| and if that is not adequate in individual cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| there are provisions for variances from that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| The RN-3 general residential district starts at a 5,000 square foot minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| with increasing lot sizes for duplexes and townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| The minimum lot width is 50 feet and 20 foot minimum lot width for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| So you could do, if you had a 20 foot townhome, you wouldn't do one townhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| If you had a 60 foot wide lot, you could do three townhomes on that lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| as long as you met the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| Maximum building coverage is a bit greater in this, 35% for standard single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| and duplexes, 50% for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Just a note, and we'll get into this a bit more later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| there are some basic design standards for duplexes and townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| The RN-4, maintaining that 5,000 square foot minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| the 50 foot minimum lot width, the setbacks are very minimal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| either 10 feet or the average of the block face, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Building height is 35 feet for single family and duplex, 45 feet for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| Maximum building coverage is, again, 35% and 50% a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Again, basic design standards for everything other than single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| There are also development standards for pocket neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| which would be permitted in this zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| The RN-5, general residential district, again, at this point, the 5,000 square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| we've had questions about whether 5,000 square feet for this is too large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| given the character of some of our existing neighborhoods that were proposed for RN-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| and we may reduce that minimum lot size in the RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| The density is approximately 28 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| medium high density in this zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| minimum lot width, 50 feet for single family and duplexes, 20 feet per townhouse unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Again, the 35% and 50% building coverage standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| RN-6, maintaining some of those same basic lot area and lot width standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1082)|
| 0:18:11| the maximum building coverage is 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Again, this zoning district allows approximately 40 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1094)|
| 0:18:22| The RN-7 is our most dense residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| It requires 700 square feet per unit for a multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| allowing approximately 62 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| which is denser than I think most development we've seen in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| The towers at Forest Heights may be about 62 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| if I remember correctly, but that gives you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| One of the challenges in reaching density like the towers at Forest Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| is the limit of the building height limit here, 65 feet, which is about four or five stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| Maximum building footprint here is 30,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| This is to try to prevent large masses of buildings requiring some breakup of the building mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| Maximum building length is 200 feet, so again, breaking up the mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| Once again, there are basic design standards for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| This is just to give you an idea of the approach we're taking to describing the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| They're both in text and in a drawing that references where these design standards come into play on a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| These are the design standards for the existing neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| or I'm sorry, established neighborhood zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| These are the proposed development standards for pocket neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| to give you an idea of pocket neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| which are a way to maximize the use of a piece of property with, in this case, detached homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| These are the design standards for duplexes, some basic design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| a minimum transparency of 15%, a primary entrance oriented towards the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| and a front-loaded attached garage is limited to 60% of the frontage of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| or 22 feet, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Design standards for our duplexes and townhomes, or both, excuse me, townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| some minimum separation between buildings, some just consistent treatment of the building facade material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| some three-dimensional features to break up the massing of the front of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| and again, that minimum transparency of 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| The minimum design standards for multifamily, again, three-dimensional treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| some consistent wrap of the materials on the facades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| and here the minimum transparency of 20%, a bit higher transparency requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| This is one of the big issues we've dealt with from the beginning in the residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| That's the accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| There is now a requirement that the ADU, the property on which the ADU is located must be owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| The owner must live either in the principal dwelling unit or the accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| There has been comments that we should require parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| There is no additional off-street parking required for accessory dwelling units currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| We do have comments requesting that parking be made a requirement for accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1294)|
| 0:21:43| And these are the policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| As I told you, I wanted to be brief in my presentation and leave plenty of time to discuss these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| I've tried to identify the ones that have been on my radar, but if you have additional ones, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| The first one is the plan development approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| As you may have noted in this, there are no more planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| The reason for that is that it hasn't worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| We haven't seen many planned residential developments in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| There are no consistent standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| There are no well-written standards for planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| It's been a way to get additional density, get your property zoned, plan residential six units an acre, and do smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1341)|
| 0:22:31| I'm not sure that's effective and meets any purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| The plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| And there is only one review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Once the zoning is done for the plan itself, the project development plan, there's only one public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| That's before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| The plan development approval process is seen as a more modern way to approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| It's been in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| I can think of cities who have taken this approach for 20-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| So it's not cutting edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| It's just something new to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| And the process involves an applicant, a property owner, meeting with staff, proposing their idea, getting input from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| There's an optional conceptual plan reviewed by the planning commission with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| That is not a requirement, but it would be encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| There is a required preliminary plan reviewed by the planning commission with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| That recommendation of the planning commission then goes to city council, who again reviews the preliminary plan with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1409)|
| 0:23:38| There may be recommendations for changes, revisions to that preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| A final plan is created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| And that final plan is subject to review and approval by the planning commission with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| At a minimum, there are three opportunities for public review and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| There may be four opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| One of the mandates of the planned development approach is that there's some public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| Preservation of steep slopes, preservation of wet areas, dedication of open space, provision of senior housing or meeting other needs of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1442)|
| 0:24:15| So there is a stated goal of meeting a city purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| If you have any questions or comments, that's a pretty quick summation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| One key feature is this could apply to any zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| and the city council has the ability to waive the underlying use and dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| So in an RM1 zone, someone could do a mixed-density housing development that would have single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1476)|
| 0:24:46| townhomes, and attached condo flats all in the same development that would be subject to review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1486)|
| 0:24:56| So it waives those and offers some flexibility and creativity to the developer or property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| It also offers a tool to the city to get goals, to attain goals that it sets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| such as, again, the preservation of steep slopes, the provision of senior housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| or even we have to be careful how we state this because we can't mandate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| but maybe the developer volunteers to provide some affordable housing and meeting the city goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| as part of that planned development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| Happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Council, you've heard a very quick presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| That was pretty concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| I'm sure council has some questions, so Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I guess the first part I would go to is the goals for non-residential districts that you went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1545)|
| 0:25:54| I think these are very, very good goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I think there's a lot of discussion here about protecting the character of our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| which I think is something we definitely need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| One additional thing that I think we should look at, too, is the preservation of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| or building in affordable housing as we're going through this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| That's an issue that I know all of us have been dealing with on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| but that was something I saw that wasn't directly mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| Maybe it was indirectly referred to, but I thought we should spell that out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| I have to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| This is what I get for cutting and pasting while I'm on the phone to you earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| This should state residential districts as opposed to non-residential, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| I'd actually look to Mr. Frost for some assistance with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| but I'll start addressing affordability and zoning ordinance as a very slippery and tricky endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1614)|
| 0:27:03| We've tried to reach that without stating it directly by that goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| provide opportunities for a variety of housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| We already have a state mandate that we can't require affordable housing through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| I fear that if we mention affordable housing as a goal of our zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| that we would be subject to, I can't even imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| since I've seen some interesting legislation lately, proposed legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| so I'm not sure what may result from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| but I think we'd be much safer to use this goal to provide opportunities for a variety of housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| and know that by providing for more opportunities for residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| through our mixed uses along our corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| through allowing duplexes as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| through a fairly strategic approach to R and 3 and R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| by providing a pure multifamily zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| by protecting some of our existing neighborhoods that are affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| that we've addressed the affordable housing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Mr. Frost, is there anything to add about the legal aspects of addressing affordability through a zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Director Green did exactly briefly describe there is a state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| he referenced about mandating affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| and grew out of issues in Nashville, I believe, three or four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| where the state took away from local governments their ability to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Okay, so just to be clear, there's nothing in RICO that says that there is a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| anywhere within the city limits that would say affordable housing can be zoned here versus there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| No, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure that we're clear on that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you. So, Mr. Green, if someone just said why is this proposal for a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| why is it better than what we currently have, what would you say would be some of the points you think are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| an improvement of what we have now to this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| One is that, you know, I'll speak to some issues that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1772)|
| 0:29:41| Just so I'm aware of it, in West Hills, the character of the neighborhood is about half acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| some a bit smaller, but far larger than the 7,500 square foot minimum lot size that's in West Hills now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| We've had developers come in and propose lots that meet the zoning standard that are out of character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| with that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| The 10,000 square foot minimum lot size better matches the character of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Conversely, or on the other side, we have neighborhoods or lots, some in Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| some Bell-Morris, some in Lonsdale, some in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| the older neighborhoods that are smaller than 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| It's challenging if they want to do additions, they have a non-conforming lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| they may have to obtain a variance in order to do an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Even to build, if you have a vacant lot that's 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| and a zone that requires a 7,500 square foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Ahrens can speak of the approach to doing that, but it makes it difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| One of the things we've addressed or have tried to address in this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| if there are still lots that may be smaller than 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| we have a provision that allows those to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| single family homes and duplexes to be constructed on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| as long as you meet the minimum lot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| regardless, or minimum lot width, I think, and setbacks, I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| But we're trying, with the non-conforming lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| you can build a permitted use on those constructed permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| The provisions for duplexes as a special use are more clear than in our existing zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| We have design standards for all residential development other than single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| trying to match the character of existing neighborhoods with new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| so that we don't have, and someone may not like me saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| but there's an apartment complex in your neighborhood, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| on East Scott Avenue that doesn't quite fit in with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| We don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| We want to provide those opportunities for a variety of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| but we want them to fit in with the character of our neighborhood so they're sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| and they contribute to the overall well-being and pleasure of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| So, Gerald, like you said, the single hottest topic probably that we've heard about has been ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| So let's talk about what it is, and you and Peter talk about what is allowed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| If I wanted to build a two-car garage with a room above it that's detached from the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| and I want to build that room, I can do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Tell me what I can do today, Peter, and tell me what problems you run into with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| and what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Let's talk that out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| So garage apartments, as they're called in the current code, are limited to certain districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| I'd have to look those up specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| But in reality, the existing structures are already there outside of the districts that allow for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1970)|
| 0:32:59| So then we run into nonconformities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| It doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| I haven't heard a lot of complaints of these garage apartments in districts that don't allow for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1984)|
| 0:33:14| Under the current code, accessory structures are limited in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| and those numbers have carried over to the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| So if you've got an accessory structure, the size is limited based on the size of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| In addition, we've got, as you see on the screen, maximum gross floor areas for an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2010)|
| 0:33:40| Now, if you're going to put that accessory dwelling unit above your garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| those limitations are going to be more restrictive than what you see on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| which is, I guess, allows for a larger accessory dwelling unit if it's part of your primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2028)|
| 0:33:58| Can you clarify for us what page that is, what's on the bottom of it, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| So if I want to build a two-car garage, detached garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| and I'm not declaring that I'm just going to make it a studio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| and I come in and I submit my plans and say I'm going to make it a studio, it's not for living, it's just for a studio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| but I am going to put a bathroom in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Are we talking under today's code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Under today's code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Under today's code, if you don't have we make sure that if it's not permitted as a garage apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| we make sure you don't have provisions for eating, sleeping, and sanitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| So sleeping, you can sleep anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Permanent cooking facilities either need to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| or permanent bathing facilities need to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| So we wouldn't let you put a kitchen in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| So a Keurig comes like a kitchen, all right, on the kitchen and a water back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I can have a bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Today I can have a bathroom, but I can't have a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Well, you can have a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| You just can't have a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| I just can't have a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| That's what we run into is people say, you know what, I've got my mother coming in and she needs assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| We want to build this above the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| And we say, no, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| So they say, okay, I've removed the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| It's just a studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| It's not even a studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| It's just a place where I can hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| But it has a bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| And so what we're trying to do and what you, I mean, the proposed ordinance that you're proposing is in response to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| is to say we have people that are out there coming in and saying, no, no, it's just a studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| Nobody's going to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| No pulled out couch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| And we're trying to provide an ordinance that tightens it down a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| but it allows what people are using it for already today with many without permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| I would say that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| So, but the difference is it's not buildable in every residential zone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2168)|
| 0:36:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Whether it's a dwelling unit, it's just a separate garage is not allowed or it is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| It is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| It is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| And you're going to be limited to the size of the garage based on your lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| So let's say I have a detached garage and then I put a covered walkway and attach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Now, is it attached in the current ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| And how are you addressing that with this going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Because this exists all over town in people's backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| They have detached garage units that they build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| And now, and to keep it from under the guise of a detached unit, they built a covered walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| Does that make it an attached unit today and does that make it an attached unit going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| Because there's a difference, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| We don't see people doing that if the garage is in an appropriate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| We see those situations more when the garage extends in front of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| and you can't have an accessory structure in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| And so that's when we see folks getting creative and attaching them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| And that's where we and my folks, we make sure that it's integrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| and not just attached by something that's obviously tacked on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2257)|
| 0:37:45| Because a corner lot becomes Yip Tube front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| We fixed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| That's a whole separate conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I think we've made great efforts to fix the issues with corner lots that we deal with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| As it relates to ADUs in accessory structures, today you can build your accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| Under recode, you can build your accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| I believe it's the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Today you can't put a kitchen in your rec room with your bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Under recode, the kitchen goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Practically speaking, we see them being used the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| It just makes it legal and we have fewer people erasing lines on plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| They're being more truthful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| So the last question I have about that is you came back and revised it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| in one of the last revisions to acquire it and be owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| So the owner has to live in the house or live in the ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| How are we going to regulate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| Best case scenario from my perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Not the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Maybe the next owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| I have no idea on the next owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Best case scenario, if that continues to remain in the code, we'll verify it when we issue permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| But we don't know when people sell their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| We don't track real estate sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| We don't track when people move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| And so I don't know a practical way to track that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I think that would be like most of our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| We'd have to rely upon the neighbors and complaint based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| Much of our code, Peter, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| doesn't have staff driving around looking for zoning code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Complaint-driven system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Somebody would have to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| It's like, wait a minute, neither one of them are living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| And then that would bring in codes enforcement and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Councilwoman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| You can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| You might ask my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Well, you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| So with regards to the accessory dwelling units, I have heard a number of concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| and this is not really addressed to Gerald and to Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| but I've heard a number of concerns from constituents about the introduction of accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| especially in areas that, like we just heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| don't currently have the option for having these type of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| And they're really designed as single-family, low-density neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| And the question I would ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| does the introduction of ADUs change that from a single-family residential neighborhood to now, you know, a two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2450)|
| 0:41:00| Because you have potentially two families living in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| And so I'd suggest we have a little bit of a discussion about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| because I know that there is some pretty serious concern about that impact on the character of the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| which we talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| I think Gerald talked a little bit at the beginning of this about the requirement for off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| I certainly would be supportive of that and would want to hear some comments on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| But the other thing I would think about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| why did we have some of these in some zones and not in other zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| And maybe some of that had to do with the infrastructure in that particular neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| or in the character of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| If you have on-street parking with accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| then are we making it more difficult through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| maybe less wide roads to get emergency vehicles in and out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| Is that what we're, you know, what we're trying to deal with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| That's why I think the off-street parking is definitely necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| But I'd also want to just consider whether or not this is a one-size-fits-all solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| that is not in line with the character of all neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| And I'd just love to hear everyone's comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| So I'll start with the parking issue because I think that one's a little bit easier for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| I think based on the research that the Knox Area Realtors Association has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| it looks like really the only issue that's come up somewhat consistently across other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| that allow ADUs is parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| So it distresses me that so many of the decisions we have to make in our community are around motor vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| So I'm a little distressed about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| But I do think that based on just that evidence, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| their research showed that some of the other concerns that people validly have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| haven't been worn out in other communities that have adopted ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| as a sort of common residential development practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| They're not overtaking communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| And the infrastructure around cars does become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| So I would say I would support adding a parking requirement for ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| as minimal a parking requirement as possible, and I don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| Just, again, as far as some of the other concerns that have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| although I understand them and certainly don't think they're invalid concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| the idea that ADUs, when permitted, become sort of a rampant use of property is not worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2637)|
| 0:44:09| It seems as though the cost of building an ADU, the purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| which is often generally due to the shift of our society towards more of a multigenerational caretaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2654)|
| 0:44:23| you know, as expenses rise and we have, you know, baby boomers and now Gen Xers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| are being bracketed by adult, by parents who have fewer resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| and by children who have fewer resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| So being able to share some of those expenses in a common setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| seems to be sort of something that our society needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| So I would say that I'm in favor of the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| and I think we need to minimize the effects that we know might be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| and parking seems to be the big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Before we move further, this is an issue that we've all heard a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| over the whole time of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| So it might be appropriate right now, and Council, you tell me if you object to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| to allow some in the audience who would like to make a comment specifically about the accessory dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| to come forward and do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| I say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| My goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| If you would please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Sandra Korbelick, 5212 Daphne Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Regarding maintenance or following the ADU ownership residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| it's easy enough to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| All you have to do is have the applicant, the existing owner, file on their title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| so that the new owner is made aware through the title search of that stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I'm David Nix, Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| About the parking situation for the ADUs, which Park Ridge was in favor of ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| to help increase the density is what the city was wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| and I understand the issue about the parking that's being brought up about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| So if you have an ADU that's in the back of the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| and then if you're going to use the alley then to access that ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Now, used to the city would tell you that the alley cannot be used as a means of egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| If he's going to build a garage in your backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| you had to have access from the street, not from the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| So that might be an issue that we have to look at if you're going to make the alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| the main entryway in and out for the ADU because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| the garbage trucks and the maintenance trucks use that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| so you might be trying to get out to go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| and the streets are blocked because of garbage trucks out there getting garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| Sir, before you leave, if you would please give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| 24, what, 13? It's Fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| Are you sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Gary, if you'd please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Gary Lowe, PO Box 50444, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| My concern is that Mayor O'Haro said in a television interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| that she wanted to maintain the integrity of the low-density suburban neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| and although she didn't say West Hills, that was one neighborhood that came to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| But what I'm hearing tonight and elsewhere is that the ADUs would be available to be built anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| and she mentioned so maintain the integrity of the suburban neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| and then locate the ADUs in more densely populated areas like downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| So she was saying that on television just a few weeks ago on WAT East Tennessee This Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| However, it appears that the ADUs could be built anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| So I'd like clarification if we could get that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| It's currently drafted ADUs would be permitted in all residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Subject to the standards that were up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Are there any other comments regarding Joyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| And once again, give us your name and address. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Joyce Fell, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| And I just want to say that I support the dedicated parking that Councilman Robert Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| It's not the first time somebody had trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Sorry. I actually know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| He's actually my council member, and council member Welch supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| So I support that too. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Thank you. Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| So I want to point out what David just told us about Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| and that I think supports what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| The infrastructure for parking is different in different parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| So if we have a one-size-fits-all solution of ADUs everywhere, how do we deal with parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2954)|
| 0:49:23| If you say we're going to deal with parking, it needs to be off street because of how it affects West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| then it affects a place with a more urban grid to it than a suburban feel to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| So a one-size-fits-all solution I don't think works here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| So what we should do instead is look at where accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| and I agree with my colleague that you're not going to see a lot of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| but there are some places that have the infrastructure to deal with certain things and some that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| So I really appreciate David making that comment because I think it drives home the point that we can't treat every place exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=2997)|
| 0:50:06| Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| I want to also echo that, and I was going to actually comment on Mr. Nix's concern with the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| and also with the alleys and how those can be potentially assessed to be able to use for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| So I do think that as we move forward, we may need to step back and look at each neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| and what those specific needs look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| So I do hope that my council colleagues will also be in agreement with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| because there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to our neighborhoods and how they're made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| And parking is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| You cannot force additional parking where there's parking on the streets already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| and there's existing neighbors that may have to walk a block away from their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| because of an accessory dwelling resident who's taking up those spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| So I think we definitely need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| A couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| So this is kind of outside of the scope of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| I know you guys like getting into the real depth of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| but I live in one of those neighborhoods that has the grid-like structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| and as the businesses develop along our fringes, we have a lot of vacant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| and as they've developed, there were some businesses that came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Flats and Taps is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| They didn't have access to the large surface lot behind them initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| and before they opened the west location, we had a lot more traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| a lot more visitors there that are now using the west one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| We had a lot of people not from our area that were using our neighborhood streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| blocking our alleys, literally parking in the turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| And I only bring that up, and it's outside the scope of RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| but in the future, as things get denser and we have those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| where we're bounded by commercial there, we may need to look at permitted parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| and I'm not familiar with that because we haven't done that in the city that I'm familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| But, you know, we were put a squeeze on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| And the other thing that often comes at us is alley closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| You know, they go to MPC, then they come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| There have been a lot of alleys in our area that have been closed and shut off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| and we might need those grid-like, I mean, they're gone, they're deeded out to individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| because in the 40s, 50s, 60s, people moved away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| and there was less demand and local knowledge and care for those, and we lost them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| So as we increase the density, I think we need that grid-like structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| and it's not always there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| It's been made private property and driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| If I can comment, just to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Actually, Dr. Lyons and I have talked about the need for residential parking permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| and where that might be appropriate, and we see the future for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| I'm glad that's something that is outside the purview of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| and would fall on someone else because it's a challenging thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| Ms. Brooks brought up in the planning staff the sort of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| I don't know how to phrase it other than to be straightforward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| the sort of weirdness in not allowing driveways off an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| and that's a standard that we've already identified as something we need to work with city staff to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| I've lived in a community for 20 years that was a grid system where the alleys were maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| and they were great for access, for parking, for service issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| With regard to parking and requiring off-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| to Councilwoman McKenzie's statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| if you're in an older neighborhood where you can't provide the off-street parking for an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| it wouldn't be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| I mean, that's a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| I think if we go, just as a comment, if we go to every neighborhood in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| and assess whether ADUs are suitable for that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| all of us would be in an ADU being cared for by our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| especially me because I think I may be in an insane asylum by that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| We hope no time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| I think there are a couple more people that would like to make a remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Ma'am, if you would please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Patricia Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue in Knoxville, South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| And Ms. Welsh is my councilman, who I greatly appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| When it comes to, I just want to make a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| I do believe that there should be off-street parking designated for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| I'm in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| As for residential parking permitting, probably about four and a half, five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| I did an Excel spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| There were at least 40 different cities throughout the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| that I actually looked up how they deal with old neighborhoods like Old Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| where we have only on-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| and how we can combat that with businesses and other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| Anyways, it's an enormous Excel spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| I don't even know if I can pull it up anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| But it was sent to every single council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Gerald got a copy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| Anyways, it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| It addresses construction vehicles, nurses that may have to come see someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3342)|
| 0:55:52| But it deals with costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| Sometimes costs might be extremely low to an actual resident, like even just $10 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3355)|
| 0:56:04| But they have to prove that they live there, that they have utility bills or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Anyways, in some cases, if they do like a $25 a year permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| that money is put back into that same neighborhood for beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| So there's a lot of different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| And I did do an Excel spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| It was sent to all council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Nick Pavlis didn't want to visit it right now when he was in office and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| But just to let you know that there are people that live in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| that have thought well ahead of issues that are old neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| And I live in SW1, which is solely residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| I'm sorry, Patty, but this has nothing to do with anything that we can do with the updated zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| If I could get back to the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Let's stick with the accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| But parking for accessory buildings is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Sorry, Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| We've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| If we have remarks about accessory dwelling units, if you'd please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| My name is Gabby Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| I live at 1307 Michaels Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Let me be sure that I have this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| These AUDs would make two dwellings on one partial of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| Potentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Now, I know now in this day and time, I'm a realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| and I have a lot of folks that need the space or whatever to take care of a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| But let's say that we are allowed to build this additional structure on that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| and we have two dwellings on one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| What's going to happen when those people, you know, the parents stop off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| they decide they're tired of city living and they're going to move to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| and they go to sell their house, guess what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| It's going to turn into rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| You know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Because FHA, USDA, for the places that do qualify for USDA, THDA is not, will not finance it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3499)|
| 0:58:34| because it's a multi-structure, a multi-family structure on one partial of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3514)|
| 0:58:43| So you've only got cash or you're going to have a conventional loan where a person is going to have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| Most lenders would charge 20% for a multi-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| So what do you think is going to happen to those, you know, on down the road 10 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| What's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| They're going to be rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| And I thought what our goal was was to have more homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| And I'll use my personal example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| I think I've been transparent that in my house there's a basement apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| an accessory dwelling unit that's now illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| I'm not sure what the financing problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| We had no problems financing our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| I don't think anyone ever asked, actually, whether there was an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| And I think those are legitimate concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| and that's the reason why the requirement is that there be owner occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| And, again, it's dependent upon your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| I think if I started renting my accessory dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| my neighbors wouldn't complain as long as I lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| But when I moved, I'm sure that Peter's office would get a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| if I decided to rent both units and the owner didn't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| So I think we have to rely some upon the diligence of our citizens in protecting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| try to do something that, again, will never please everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| Let's try to think of what our goal is as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| and one of those is to increase the variety of housing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| diversity of housing options in the city, and look at different approaches to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| I'll spill the beans on Council Member Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| He's come up with a way to monitor this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| and you'll hear more about that later to see how these things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| But sometimes our fears are much greater than the reality that ensues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| Council Member Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| I mean, I'm done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| You don't want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| All right, sir, if you would, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Michael Stinson, 1401 Cuesta Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| Some of the questions that I actually have here, just because when we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| especially with the ADUs, so like the realtor that was just up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| as she was addressing, what happens whenever you establish an ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| and you sell that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Can they actually turn that back into a single household dwelling unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Okay, so there's not going to be any stipulation on, you know, expanding or retracting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| No, I would imagine the house that Gerald bought, the previous owner may have used it as a rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| but Gerald does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| So it's just use your property as you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Our dogs like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Our dogs like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Oh, I'm sure they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Some of the other things that I'm actually curious about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| especially when it comes down to the parking, because off-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| I think is going to be essential, especially when it comes down to emergency personnel, police, ambulance, fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| They're going to have to be able to get in to and fro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| And just because, especially when you start adding into the mix about increasing the density of these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| is there going to be a minimum parking for each unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| So like for where I live at right now, we can easily fit four cars in our driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| but we actually have a pretty good-sized house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| So what happens if you actually add an accessory dwelling unit just because it may be a couple that's actually living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3734)|
| 1:02:22| a husband and wife, that fall on hard times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| So now there's going to be two cars as opposed to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Peter and I briefly whispered about that during this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| The current standard for a single-family home is two parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| If there were an accessory dwelling unit that would pursue this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| that would be an additional parking space required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| and a site plan would have to be provided showing that that space is available on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| Okay, and just some of the more radical fears that have been going around is just because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| I live in Holston Hills, and with a lot of this, when it comes down to the bills and the codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| what would happen is it hypothetically possible, say, that I have a couple million dollars that are just kind of burning a hole in my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3783)|
| 1:03:13| So I want to go ahead and take down my house, rezone it as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| Can I do that in Holston Hills and actually build possibly even like a Skyrise Apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| or actually have some kind of apartment complex within that residential unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| Because under the current codes, it protects us from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| With these new codes, will it do the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| The same process is in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Any property owner has the right to apply for any rezoning they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| That request is reviewed by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| It's compared to the sector plan, which is the longer-range plan for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| and dictates the land use permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| The staff makes a recommendation that goes to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| The Planning Commission reviews it at a public hearing with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| It then goes to City Council for final action and take two readings at City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| again, public hearing with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| So the same process is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| The process for zoning change does not vary from our existing ordinance to the new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| Again, any property owner can ask for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| Whether they get it is ultimately up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| But right now as it stands, it does stand as a plausibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| It may happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Regardless of what the code says, you can apply for a rezoning and it could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| but the likelihood that in the middle of Holston Hills you'd be approved for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| is slim to none under our existing code and would be slim to none under the proposed code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| That does settle me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| Because I don't even think you actually have to apply for commercial if you want to do apartments, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| You'd have to apply for multifamily if you're in an RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| You'd have to apply for a minimum RN4 for zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| Okay, because I'm not really sure where Holston Hills would fall in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| Most of Holston Hills is an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Yeah, and that's one of the other fears that I was having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| Sure, you've got 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Yeah, because like I said, is it going to be possible for someone to actually come into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| and build like 20 apartments on that one lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| There's going to be a public process, and I think that the response to that type of suggestion would be pretty negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| Very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| Okay, let's get back on track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Okay, well, the second most debated, hotly debated issue I think that I've heard about is duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| and especially duplexes in RN1 and RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| And if Will could pull my PowerPoint back up, I've got other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| And one of them is residential density, so you must have read my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| And yes, duplexes are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| Let's talk about that lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| I mean, the biggest or the concern I've heard the most is about subdividing a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| It was 10,000 feet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Now it's our largest lot size other than the established neighborhood is 7,500 square feet currently under the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=3997)|
| 1:06:47| With the proposed code, the RN1 would require 10,000 square feet minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| The RN2, we started in the first draft at 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| We looked at the number of nonconforming lots we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| At 7,500 square feet, we reduced it to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Actually did some more mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| We're still working on the map and tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| We identified there are some blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| We identified all the lots, RN2 zone lots, that are bigger than 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| meaning that theoretically they could be subdivided and two lots graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| A number of those did not meet the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| They were maybe long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| There's a 50-foot minimum lot width for a RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| These lots were 75 feet by 150 feet, meaning they're more than 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| but they don't have the lot size to be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| We found some clusters of lots that are over 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| have the lot width to be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| We'll go back and look at mapping of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| because we are sensitive to the concern that some RN2 lots at 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| might be subdivided and two lots graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| You think that's a legitimate concern about lot size for duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| Are we having people request that today to subdivide lots to build duplexes on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I don't have this slide with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| No, I don't because I can't access my server from down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| We have a slide, and I can get it to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| a chart, a graph of the number of duplexes that have been requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| and permitted over the past 10 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| I think in the last year we've had no permits for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| And some design standards are attached to these duplexes as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| At one time we had those a little higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| We've kept them for the duplexes the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| We had them for single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| And keep in mind, I know there are some valid fears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| that with the smaller lot size for duplexes in a certain neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| that is characterized by 7,500 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| which is the minimum lot size for a duplex in the RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| that all the homes could be turned into duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| A duplex approval would require review and approval by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| So staff would be sensitive to the character, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| going back to that goal of maintaining the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| and likely would not recommend that every home on a block be converted to a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4182)|
| 1:09:51| even though they met the minimum lot size because of the change in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| And, again, there's a public hearing with the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| for public input from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| So the public opinion, I mean, there's a public process to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| You have the right to deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| And you have design standards that go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| You have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| You have a parking requirement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| And there's duplexes scattered about today, would you say, in the residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| Oh, yes. I think of my neighborhood where they're scattered around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| They're scattered around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| All right. Thank you. That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| On the special use approval process, duplexes and anything else subject to special approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| would go to the Planning Commission for review with public hearing and public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| Appeals would come to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| So if the Planning Commission for some reason approved a use as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| that the neighbors did not think was appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| the appeal could be to this commission, would be to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| So there's ample opportunity for public review and approval by the public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| Yeah. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Could you just elaborate a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| Make sure I understood what you said, but make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| So you're saying if there were applications for duplex, they'd all be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| and that there might be at some point you would deny because it changes the character of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| because it reaches a tipping point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| And I realize that's subjective, and we would look at each case individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| and look at the impact on the neighborhood, look at the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| I know there's been a number of comments about are the streets adequate to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| the additional traffic that would be generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| As Councilmember Wallace said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| is there adequate room for the off-street parking required for the duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| I think there are a number of issues that would be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| that would be unique to each request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| In addition to those design standards that would be standardized for all duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| Okay. And since you brought up parking with duplex and we moved on from ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| I just want to clarify, we have no means, even if we say a unit has to have X number of spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| and you have to show some off-street parking, we can't make people use that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| I could park in front of my house, all three of my vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| even though I have lots of parking area at my house on my personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| Okay. Just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Gerald, there's comments in the one-year plan about duplexes. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Okay. And those comments from the one-year plan that this council passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| you know, I guess less than a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| and the one that we're going to be looking at here coming up soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| those comments haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Although we will, one of the tasks that we have as planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| following the hope for adoption of the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| is that we would review the sector plans and one-year plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| and bring them into compliance with the new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| We have a number of issues to address, both the land use classification matching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| the land use classification with the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| addressing some of the standards that are in the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| incorporating those into the one-year plan and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| So that would be coming to you, we hope, before the next one-year plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| Well, and I just want to share with everybody what those standards are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| for low-density residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| And what it says is that duplexes should be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| where one or more of the following conditions exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| On a collector street, it provides a desirable buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| between residential and non-residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| The site is in an area having gross density exceeding five dwelling units per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| The site is in an area which has experienced a significant loss in housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| but is still desirable for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| And the site is a part of a planned residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| In the current draft of recode, duplexes would be allowed in more areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| than what are defined in what we've passed in the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| That's correct, and that's, again, why we would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| the staff would have to undertake an update of the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| I'm not sure when those standards were put in, but it was more than five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| And has the community changed and the needs for the community changed in five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| If we took that one standard where significant housing loss has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| then we would very narrowly define the places where duplexes would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| Is that what the council wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Is that what we want for our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| That's a question that I don't know the answer to yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| It's something that has to be talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| especially when we get into the update of those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| And I think that the reason this is in there and probably has been in there for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| is because this addresses a lot of the issues we've brought up today about parking issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| and whether or not you want to have increased density on the interior part of some neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| because maybe it will be more difficult for emergency traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| and there could be a variety of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| But I wanted to point that out for everyone to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| whether or not this same approach, which we've probably had for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| and we certainly voted on less than a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| is something we should think about with duplexes in the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| So maybe I'm asking the same question as him but slightly differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| In the current existing code that we have adopted, specifically R1 is low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| R1A is low to medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| There's the defining criteria in them all as to what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| and that correlates with the one-year plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| But the new zoning, RN1, RN2, et cetera, doesn't have those qualifiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| So if we adopt recode in some form, shape, or fashion without those qualifiers of intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| which are designated as intensity, they're described as intensity in the existing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| I'm trying to understand what happens with the one-year plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| They need to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Everything in the one-year plan, all references to our new zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| would not exist in the one-year plan and the sector plans until we update those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| As I stated, it's a task that we have following the adoption of the new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| to bring the one-year plan and the sector plans to correlate to our new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| with regard to the description of the zoning districts, the standards for different types of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| the appropriate locations for different zoning classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| So last night we gathered to look at the one-year plan, and people looked at it by color coded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| It's light industrial, it's low density, medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| What's that going to look like in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| The answer is we don't know because we're going to create it after we redefine these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| I would speculate that we'll follow the basic outlines of those land use classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| may vary them in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I'm thinking of where we now have commercial areas defined as commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| They're not mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| We'd have to redefine those as mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| There may be some places where what is designated as medium density goes to a lower density classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4666)|
| 1:17:56| I'm thinking of even your neighborhood, Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| that is now zoned for Oakwood-Lincoln Park for 24 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and is proposed for an RN2, which would be eight units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| That land use classification would change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| We have to deal with the realities that exist now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| We're under a mandate to update the one-year plan and have it to council in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| We can't speculate that this code is going to be adopted in any format at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| We would be giving you a document that speculates to the extent that it is erroneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| In our one-year plan update, we have to deal with the realities that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| We realize we have a significant task after the adoption of the new code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| to bring the one-year plan and the sector plan into compliance with our new zoning classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4728)|
| 1:18:57| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| All right, I'm going to move on to a different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| I can't remember the gentleman's name who asked about basically commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| Let's talk about neighborhood non-residential reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| That is on page 919 if you're following at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| What this says is once approval—well, let me ask this question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| Non-neighborhood non-residential—neighborhood non-residential reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| We're talking about like a church, a school, a business that might have been in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| Its intent would be the corner store that was in an older neighborhood that has gone out of business is now vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| because it's not suitable for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| There's no—the zoning for that neighborhood is now residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| And I'll pick on my friends in Oakwood-Lincoln Park again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| There's a plumbing operation that's in an old commercial building that's zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| Their grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| They can't do much of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| This would allow them limited opportunity for a use of that that would be non-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| that we think would benefit the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| It's a pretty limited art gallery, art and fitness studio, office, personal service establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4819)|
| 1:20:28| I think that's yoga. Is that yoga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| Peter? Personal service establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Well, the intent might be for those, but reading what you've got in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| I would say that a church would be—it could be this, right, if it's in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| Or there could be almost anything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Anything that was in a neighborhood that's being used in a non-residential yet way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| And the question I have is that if you review this, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| once approval of a neighborhood non-residential reuse is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| the structure may be reused for any of the uses in item two below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| And the ones we didn't talk about already are eating and drinking establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| live entertainment, retail goods establishment, social services center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| So you might have an art gallery in your neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| that all of a sudden becomes an eating and drinking establishment, and there's no review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| There's no public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| It'll still be reviewed to make sure that it meets the parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| all of the other requirements associated with a change of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| So this one I have a lot of concern over because of this lack of public review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| and the potential impact on a neighborhood of having something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| like an eating and drinking establishment or live entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Would you like to see any change of use subject to special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| I would say special use here for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| But then the other part that's troubling on this one too is no off-street parking is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| So you're going to have a live entertainment place in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| which could be, I mean, untold numbers of things, right, could fall in that category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| and there's no off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| This concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| And the goal here was to allow reuse of those structures that are often vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| They're in older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| There's no off-street parking provided for that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| So our option is look at this and do we narrow down the uses that are permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| Do we require a special use permit for any use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Or do we allow them to sit there and be vacant and deteriorated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| Which is a greater impact on that neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| And I think you can go to any of the older neighborhoods and easily answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| I think the special use is probably a good approach to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I don't have a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| So I'm going to move to this list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Okay, because I think my sense is that there are some things that you need to hear from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| in order to be able to proceed with the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| So we can go back to the top, to plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| I think that you started to summarize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| I'll finish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| I think we've approached this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| So we're now on residential density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Then we head all around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| We talked about duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Gerald, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Could you summarize kind of what the big issues are here that we need to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| Well, what is the duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| And I think we've talked a bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| What is the appropriate lot size for a duplex in the single-family districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| We've settled on a fairly small lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| I know some neighborhoods are concerned, as I mentioned, about that smaller lot size for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| But with the special use requirement and reviewing those individually, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5040)|
| 1:24:07| Do we want to go to, for example, we had in one draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| we started at 7,000 square feet as the minimum lot size for a duplex in RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| Then we went to 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| And then the planning commission directed that we go back to 7,000 square feet, which is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| Another question is, you know, we've had comments that everything within a quarter mile of a transit route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| should be multifamily to promote affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| Well, that changes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| Think about a neighborhood like Oakwood-Lincoln Park, Park Ridge, Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| a quarter mile from Kingston Pike goes pretty far into Sequoia Hills, West Hill, with bus lines around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| We've taken the approach to mapping residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| of mapping more of the built character of those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| identifying zoning multifamily where existing multifamily is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| vacant lots of areas that would seem to be appropriate for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| are zoned more intentionally RN-3 and RN-4 when they're closer to transit corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| or on the edges of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| We've actually gotten good feedback from neighborhoods about appropriate locations for RN-3 and RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| Our approach there is probably more strategic and incremental than some would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| probably less incremental than others would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| We're trying to test these waters to create a tool that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| and more importantly to create a tool that can be used in future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| We have to look not only at what we have now with the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| but where we want to go and provide tools for that vision that we have for the future of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| And I think we've tried to reach that compromise where we provide opportunities for smaller scale multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| for large multifamily development, and also to maintain our existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| that many residents of those neighborhoods have worked long and hard to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| The minimum lot size goes back to the question, what we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| the more they are into with the 5,000 square feet and the potential for subdivision of some lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| that may be more than 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| We are looking at those through the mapping process and will further refine those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| That gets back to that question of how much density do we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| We have some comments that we need more density in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| some comments that we need less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| Where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| We think the majority of voices seem to be that at this point we need to protect those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5208)|
| 1:26:57| the density that we have in the neighborhoods as they exist now to the extent possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5217)|
| 1:27:05| So thank you for getting me back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| So just a question for you about, I'm going to just provide an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| So we have, there are currently residential neighborhoods, I live in one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| that small single family homes, fairly small lot size, it's South Haven neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| and currently it's zoned for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| So multifamily could be built in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| There is some multifamily in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Under the proposed map, it would be an RN1, which would not allow for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| it would allow for duplexes, special use, but otherwise, if I have this correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| multifamily would not be permitted unless potentially under planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| So one of the things that I know that has been suggested is the idea of taking those tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| that will now be in the toolbox if this is adopted and be more strategic about mapping out neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| like South Haven and there are several neighborhoods close to downtown that are like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| where there's small affordable housing currently, single family affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| and rather than sort of opening that up for the potential of tear downs in multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| that we would be a little bit more strategic about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| How would that rezoning happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| So let's say the neighborhood association identified three lots that we thought, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| we could live with RN4 on these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| How would that, because somebody owns those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| I'll use your neighborhood and another neighborhood as examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| Your neighborhood on South Haven is a property owner who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| I'd like to do a small townhome development on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| And actually this gentleman called and came into the office and we spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| and his property on South Haven is proposed for RN4 to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| So we dealt with individual property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| There are a couple of property owners who have larger tracts, one in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| and another one off Sutherland that we had as a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| They called and they're now proposed for designation as multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| A neighborhood, Bell Morris, where the neighborhood association was very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| At one point, one map, we did designate properties along those corridors as RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| We received a lot of input and this neighborhood was one of those saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| they did not want that blanket approach, but they worked carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| And actually approached us with lots that felt areas closer to Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| and also closer to Cecil that they thought would be appropriate for RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| On the next map, those will be designated as RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| In the future, if someone wants that, they would, as I told Mr. Stinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| the rezoning process, apply for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| And we do want, we're sensitive to the need for a variety of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| If the infrastructure is available, staff would likely recommend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| and then it depends on the public process as to whether that rezoning would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| And ultimately, again, with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| We've been an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| I suggest we take a ten-minute break and come back at 11 after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| Ms. Malone, if you don't mind waiting until we finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| If I could speak to plan development when we come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| Yes, I don't know what you're going on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Since I, as we adjourned just a moment ago, I had indicated to Ms. Malone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| I would give her some time, up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| Do you want to make that part of your public comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| We're making choices, but whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| I mean, we've got eight people signed up for public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| I thought I signed up for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Well, you signed up for two things, but you're part of the public comment system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| So go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Please give us your name and address, and we will also let you speak a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5483)|
| 1:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| Let me speak about plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5495)|
| 1:31:42| What is the standard for plan development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| Excessive adverse impact on neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| Again, excessive adverse impact on neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| So in the review, as long as it's not producing an excessive adverse impact on a neighboring property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5519)|
| 1:32:09| it would have met the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| I think that is overwhelming to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| I mean, is this really what we think of our existing development, our existing taxpayers in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5535)|
| 1:32:26| That something can come in and meet that standard next to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| So I would hope council would change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| Also be aware of the fact that the only people who can request a plan development is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| Neither MPC nor council nor administration can request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| It's only the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| That distinguishes it from existing planned residential, where MPC or council, as you've done many times, can request planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5567)|
| 1:33:01| There are other ways in which it differs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| Through the review process, and the public is really not involved until the preliminary plan, and that plan then goes to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5586)|
| 1:33:15| And after that, pretty much before that and after that, the public's pretty much out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| because the review for the final plan is simply to make sure it matches the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5600)|
| 1:33:28| Okay, there's no further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| There's no greater review scheme than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| If it matches the preliminary plan, it must be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| One of the characteristics, as was said, the uses as well as the dimensional standards can all be varied by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5624)|
| 1:33:58| So again, the example that had been used earlier, in the middle of a low-density residential single-family detached neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| somebody can come in, give some goodies to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| as long as it doesn't have an excessive adverse impact on neighboring properties, it can be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5648)|
| 1:34:18| I think somebody needs to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Somebody also needs to look, again, at our existing planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| Planned residential is a very flexible zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| In the absence of planned residential, all of the residential zoning districts are very inflexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| They have specific setbacks, specific lot coverage, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| When you put this on existing properties that have developed over decades, centuries, in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5684)|
| 1:34:54| I think you're going to find a lot of preexisting nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| which on page one of this document says is what you're trying to eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| The other thing is, I think we look at planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| it was said that everything comes in less than six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| That's because the plan designation is less than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| It has nothing to do with planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| That's failure to amend the plan, the one-year sector, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| That's not a problem with planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| Again, I think with planned residential, you have the opportunity for the public to come in at the time of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| You have the opportunity for them to come in at the time of the use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| when the density is set, as well as the one-year planning process, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5742)|
| 1:35:50| The other thing with planned residential, it allows every single housing type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| multi-family, single-family, detached, attached, all of them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| a variety of lot sizes, open space, more than half of the requests for rezoning for 2018 and two months of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5762)|
| 1:36:19| Ms. Malone, you've got 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| More than half the residential requests were to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| I don't know that it's a lot we should, as a zone, we should just dismiss out of hand without looking more carefully at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5789)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| I would encourage the council members and the public to look at page 1619,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| which lists the purpose of the planned development district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| It goes far beyond the adverse impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| Specifically, facilitate the implementation of the adopted Knoxville-Knox County general plan and its component parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5812)|
| 1:37:00| including the separate plan and other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| Can you speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| And did you say 1619?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| 1619, page 1619.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| The planned development, like the planned residential, would permit all housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| It's meant to, as it says, to encourage flexibility in the development of projects to provide actually some leverage for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5836)|
| 1:37:24| And I think Ms. Malone demeans the council and your role in this process by saying anything that could be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| It's a public process, and you or those who follow you would be subject to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| would be placed in the position to approve or deny the planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| So, Gerald, where does the traditional neighborhood development fit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| So the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| What zone is that going to fit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| That would be a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| And something Ms. Malone mentioned in our existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| we've written into the code that any planned development that has been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| those approvals would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| They're mapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| They have a mapping designation and link to any conditions of approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| so that approval stays with those planned developments that have been approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Councilmember Berto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| If you look on 1620, which is where Ms. Malone was referencing that discussion about neighboring properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5903)|
| 1:38:35| in subpart three it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| in no case may an exception to district regulations be granted unless the applicant demonstrates a substantial benefit to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| And so I think we may want to look at, obviously there's an overall city effect that we want to see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| but we're talking about the effect on neighborhoods earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| We probably need to talk about that in that subsection as well, not just a broad city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| because, of course, the folks that are most impacted are going to be people living next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Not on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| Well, you've got more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| So, Gerald's talk about home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| You've opened it up a little bit more from what it is today to what you're, you know, explain that, explain how we got to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5963)|
| 1:39:32| And I'll rely on Peter to help me some with this, because he administers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| Making a distinction between home occupation and home office is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| We've wanted to lump them all together, home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| Given the nature of our work lives now, to say that someone can't work in their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| or to require a special hearing for the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| and to generate a lot of, in some cases, anxiety among the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| because they're not sure why that sign of a special hearing is in a front yard, it seems inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| We're not keeping pace with the current economic trends and the workplace trends with the standards we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6009)|
| 1:40:18| The challenges in our enforcement can't be underestimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| The distinction among neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| With our zoning on one side of the street, we could allow a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| On the other side, it would not be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| We want to allow these to acknowledge the status of the workplace now that many people work at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6034)|
| 1:40:42| I have a computer at home, and I do work at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| I'm technically illegal, and Peter could, I guess the city could find me and tell me I can't work at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6046)|
| 1:40:54| which may be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| And I'll let Peter pick it up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| We have heard some of the comments about limiting it to 25 percent of the floor space of the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6060)|
| 1:41:07| and certain others, and we have limited it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| There's no sale of any item not created on the property, and that sale has to be by appointment only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6071)|
| 1:41:18| So we're trying to increase the standards to acknowledge the concerns of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| while still permitting a broader approach to home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| It goes back to what we already talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| Hans, do you have to provide parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| And then what kind of signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Because you've changed that a little bit as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| We have, and I'm going to let Peter talk about the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6101)|
| 1:41:50| It's always fun trying to enter somebody's home unannounced based on complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6110)|
| 1:41:59| So it is something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| We go as far as we can under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| Under the current code, they're limited to 25 percent, or I think it's 25 percent of the square footage of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| So we've had zoning inspectors out there with tape measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| measuring to see how big their home office is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| and asking to look through people's garages to see if there's business equipment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6141)|
| 1:42:32| We just find it difficult as we pursue complaints on home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6152)|
| 1:42:43| I think the intent was to try and look at the negative impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| and regulate those negative impacts versus trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| yes, you can sell honey because you have a beehive in the backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| but you can't sell a beanie baby that you bought on eBay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6176)|
| 1:43:03| Those sorts of distinctions and differences are very difficult for us to regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| and so that was the intent behind what you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| But from the operations side, we're open to a better mousetrap if we can find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| Well, signage is a complaint I've heard, that we've increased the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| and can have more signs and talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| I don't think that was the intent, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| It's on 1324.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| There are also some standards on 1011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| Well, the signs on 1324.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| As Peter said, we're open to reducing those operational signage requiring on-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| the limitation on the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| I think those are reasonable, even though at times challenging to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6236)|
| 1:44:04| We don't want stuff we can't enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| I think that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| I don't think it was the intent to increase the amount of signage allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| That may have been because that was identified not in the sign ordinance portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| I think it was in a separate section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Honestly, that's why it's difficult when we've got sections stuck throughout the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6261)|
| 1:44:30| Okay, that's really all I have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| I think we can make those adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Going through the home occupations, I find that it's easier when I'm looking through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| to think about what we have currently versus what's proposed in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| Let me go through that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Councilman Wallace had mentioned some of these points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| Currently, home occupations, which is different than home office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| are limited to no more than 25% of the dwelling unit and require use on approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| Under the present code, there's a list of permitted occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| some of which are artist, barber, beauty shop, professional office, teaching, tutoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| programming of computers, telephone answering, and cooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| But there's also a list of prohibited uses, which are tea room, tourist home, real estate office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| convalescent home, funeral establishment, animal hospital, repair shop, and catering service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| In what we have currently in the draft, we've removed the 25% standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| but we also removed the prohibited and permitted list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| It's also very clear in the current ordinance that home occupations are not allowed in accessory buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| and that off-street parking is required, but again, these are not in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| There was a catch-all phrase that they had put in there that helped deal with other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6355)|
| 1:46:02| that might attempt to use this, and that language had also been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| So when I had mentioned this to a neighbor, they had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| well, so next door they could have a funeral, let me get the right word, funeral establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6376)|
| 1:46:25| And of course that would be a little bit of a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| A funeral home and a crematory are defined in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| and they're listed as permitted uses in certain districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Just because something, if we listed for every district what is not permitted there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| this would become even more voluminous than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| More cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| What we have to look at is those uses, if they're specifically permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| and I trust Mr. Ahrens, I've gotten to know him well enough to trust his intelligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| and to be able to determine whether if I come in and want to have my planning consulting office in my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| that that is a home occupation, but a tea room with a number of citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6427)|
| 1:47:14| an eating and drinking establishment is not permitted and that is a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| I think we can't define every use that there would be, nor can we, that we would want to permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6440)|
| 1:47:29| nor can we define every use that we would want to prohibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| I think by trusting the abilities of the code administrators and having standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| and as Peter said, we're open to those operational standards of parking, percentage of the home, the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| We have addressed the sales of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| So I think by doing that, we are able to be flexible enough to address changes in the workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6469)|
| 1:47:57| and the work environment, but also stringent enough to protect the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| from unwanted consequences of a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| Well, I guess what I would ask is whether or not the current language needs really to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| And I would pose that to the other council members because in my discussions with folks in the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6495)|
| 1:48:23| this is something that they're very concerned with, and so I would suggest looking into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| and seeing if this is something we really want to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| And I agree with what Gerald is saying and what Peter is saying about the challenges of some enforcement here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6513)|
| 1:48:41| but if you remove all of these standards, what could we see in unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6521)|
| 1:48:54| I think we went through, we heard the same things, and we went to Article V, Section 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| In Part A, there are seven standards, and number one we've captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| Number two is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| It's the 25% rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| What page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| I'm in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Just identifying that of the seven items, of the seven standards, we've captured five of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| The two that are missing that I don't have any problem throwing back in would be the 25% of the dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| and no home occupation shall be conducted in any accessory building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| But the others are very similar, if not verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| The big change that you're seeing is that we don't have the list of approved and prohibited occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6581)|
| 1:49:55| and that's a thing that gets interesting because, you know, occupations change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6595)|
| 1:50:05| And I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to come and get a T-room permit since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| And I think we're just trying to recognize that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| Well, I think some of those have changed, like telephone answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| I don't know that there's a lot of that that goes on anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| So, I mean, I think some updating here is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| But what I like that you're saying, Peter, is, you know, hey, I'm not opposed to putting the 25% rule back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| You know, maybe there's some language in there that gives you a little bit of guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| so you can point to something and say, well, this is why we don't have a funeral establishment here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| or something like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| So that would be my point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Maybe the list needs to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| Maybe there's some different language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| But let's pay attention to that section and see what we can do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Now, the second part to that is home office, which is currently permitted in R1E but not in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6655)|
| 1:51:04| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| So the entirety of home office has been removed in RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| And I don't have an objection to folks having a home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| I mean, the notes that I have on RECODE, I think I did a lot of that at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| So that was my home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| So, Gerald, you and I, we're both in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| And what we tried to do was incorporate home office and home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| Well, but I think they may be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| So maybe there's a distinction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| And it's clear in the current write-up for home office, you know, again, you've got the 25% standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6695)|
| 1:51:45| but there's no employees shall be permitted to work on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| You know, this is supposed to be your home office, like I'm going to do accounting work at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6709)|
| 1:51:57| and I'm not, like, inviting clients over and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| Go ahead, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| I don't think that we've ever in the five years that I've been here had somebody request a home office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| because that's an extension of your personal living in your residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| And I think that's why it was taken out, because there are no negative impacts to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| If your neighbors know that you're doing accounting work in the front room, I would just waive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| Well, and that's something that's interesting about the current code is that it's only allowed in R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6747)|
| 1:52:35| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| And so that probably doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| It probably should be allowed everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| And so I understand why you're removing it, but I think we should at least mention that that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| And, you know, there are some restrictions in here that we might want to think about incorporating into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6764)|
| 1:52:51| if we're going to combine the two things, incorporating them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| And we do have the employee limitation and home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| I think we can look at those operational standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| and expand them a bit looking at our current code and the new code and make sure we capture them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| I guess I would ask, as you read through the home office section, Part E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| which one of those 11 items are not part of your average person's daily life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| Oh, I'm not arguing at all that we need to restrict home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| I'm thinking home office is, to be clear, I think home office is fine as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| And I think the thing you need to look at is, you know, if you're going to combine home office and home occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6815)|
| 1:53:42| I think there is a little bit of a distinction there between those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| So maybe look at what the restrictions are currently in home office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| and see if you need to expand that in home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| Councilman Wallace, real quick, if you look on page 10-11 in home occupation, Part R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| it talks about the signage as being limited to two square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| which I think is consistent with today's standards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| It is. It just allows for ground or column signs now, if you look at 13-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6851)|
| 1:54:22| Those aren't currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6862)|
| 1:54:32| Page 13-24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| It should be, yeah, 13-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| D-1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| I'm not sure where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Because currently it's got to be on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| And we can make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| That's more of a commercial or office district type of, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| I guess you realize now that neither Peter nor I have memorized every word of this document yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6902)|
| 1:55:09| But you have done a really good job of trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Because when I ask you questions, you come up with, oh, yeah, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| But it's nice to know we can still find something new in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| That's why there's nine of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| I wonder if those on 13-24 are for churches in residential districts versus home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6923)|
| 1:55:32| It says for approved home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| I think we need to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| It says for home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| Councilwoman St. Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| I would like to, I'm still talking about home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| I'd like to be cautious about what we limit and what we allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| I mean, there actually is phone answering services right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| There's a virtual secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| With the gig economy, a lot is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| And I think that needs to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| I also wondered if in the use matrix, doesn't that define what is allowed in the residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| And it should apply to the occupation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| That's what I was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| That gives us the guidance for the tea room or eating and drinking establishment, the funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| I think that use matrix and the prohibited uses and the operational standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6981)|
| 1:56:30| upgrading the operational standards will give us the direction we need and the protection for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| So instead of a separate list, it's kind of all here in the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| You just have to refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| So quick question about procedure and how this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| Councilwoman Welch made a comment about you need certain things from us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| As we're discussing this and one person comments and says I like this or I think this needs to be edited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| or I don't like that, how is this happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| Is it you're just making notes and you're going to make edits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| I mean, I believe you guys are making notes, but let's say three out of the nine of us agree with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| or six out of the nine of us agree with something or nine out of the nine of us agree with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| Are we then to say directive we agree with this or we disagree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| Is it going to get amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Because I'm trying to understand how this process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| When Councilman Roberto says I don't feel comfortable with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| are we supposed to all push our buttons and say me neither| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| or then are we supposed to all make a meeting with you, which I don't feel is transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| because we can't leave here and talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| And we all don't want to sit here until you, I get the sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| don't want to sit here until midnight while we go through the weeds of every little nuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| I mean, maybe I'm wrong, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| I'll sit here until midnight if you'll join me at 8 o'clock in the morning for a presentation to the industrial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| I mean, I could, but I'd probably have to be at my other job, so, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| But anyway, I'm just saying fair and valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| We have constituents that want to know how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| I think that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| What we take is the sense of the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| For example, on the last one, what we said, we'll update the operational standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7101)|
| 1:58:29| address the 25 percentage, the parking, the accessory building, clarify the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7109)|
| 1:58:36| We're not going to the list of prohibited and permitted uses because, as we've said, that's in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| And some of the burden does fall on you that the final draft, as I stated, will be on March 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| and look at your hot topics and make sure we've gotten them correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| Going to the density issue, I haven't gotten any real feel of one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| Do we stay at 7,000 square feet for duplexes in the R and 3 or go to 10,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| Again, the sense I've gotten was that what the Planning Commission has recommended is 7,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| The duplexes are a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| That's where we're – because I haven't heard it, I cry, no, we shouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| Again, taking that sense of the direction that you're giving me, we're taking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| We'll make revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| Those will be in the final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| And we'll try to, at the last workshop, whenever near the end of March, hit these items again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| and tell you how we've addressed them and then get a more direct sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| You can all push your buttons and say no or all push and say yes or debate until midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7186)|
| 1:59:53| And I won't schedule a presentation for Arlene the next morning after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| Although I find I have very little control over what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| And we'll bring coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| And I found out late in the day what that meant, but I appreciate all these people thinking about my coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| It's okay. I like it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| And I will say for everyone, I get it that we don't have a defined process because we've never done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7214)|
| 2:00:22| But when not everybody chimes in on everything, it's kind of like do we agree, do we not agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| Are we going to get to a point where we're like all in favor or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| He's assuming you agree if you don't chime in and disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| That's the way I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| I'm not disagreeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| If I disagree, I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| You're going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| Let's put the ground rules out here because there may be somebody sitting here quietly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| And I'll try to do a better job when we go over a topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| At this point, I haven't heard any comments that the plan development approval is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7248)|
| 2:00:57| You may want to think about that, and you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| We'll hit it again in our last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| For residential density, maintain the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| Look for those places where we may be able to go from RN2 to RN1 based on lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| And fine-tune the application to RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| Design standards for single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| We didn't really talk about those just briefly, but we will not have design standards for single-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| other than in the infill housing, the established neighborhood, the historic and the neighborhood conservation districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7284)|
| 2:01:33| Home occupations, we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| There's some other items that we've gotten to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| The affordability, we can't address affordability outright in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| We can try to increase the opportunity for housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| ADUs to require parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| We'll look at the comment about addressing it on the title, see if that is a way that we can enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7311)|
| 2:02:00| I'm hoping Amy's taking better notes than I have because I've been trying to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| Actually, there is a precedent, and I would ask our attorney to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| I was going to say the sign ordinance and the hillside, we did that line by line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7330)|
| 2:02:16| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| This is mainly, I guess, for members of the public and for the people who have served on council for about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| Thankfully, this process has not gone through that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| In the recent memory is the sign ordinance where we had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7350)|
| 2:02:37| I kid you not, it was six hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| We went through it, and there was informal straw polling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| Councilmember Roberto talked about, just earlier, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| I don't think these non-residential uses in residential areas should automatically be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7370)|
| 2:02:59| At that meeting, he would bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| Then, depending on the will of a straw vote, it was changed or not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7383)|
| 2:03:12| We went through those sections with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| You had different ones on the type of the street, if it was an arterial street or a collector street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| what the sign could be, if a sign could be there, the height of it, if it was elevated, if it was illuminated, different things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7404)|
| 2:03:35| Once we get real close to the end, that type of meeting might need to occur to get those things hammered out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7415)|
| 2:03:44| Some people might have issues that were talked about at the last workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7424)|
| 2:03:51| that they think they might want to have changed in what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| That's kind of how it was done with the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| That might be a good approach for our last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| We've got records of the issues that were discussed at the first workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7444)|
| 2:04:11| We've got the notes from this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| We just put those in the list and go over and send them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| Here, I'll ask for direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| Send them to the council beforehand to make sure we've gotten everything and you can add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| Would that be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| For that sign ordinance meeting, we literally went page by page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| You do page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Does anyone have something they want to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| We may try to streamline that a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| How many pages are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| Let's go one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| Gerald, on home daycare, you raised the number of children to seven from five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7487)|
| 2:04:57| That was Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| It's a state standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| We try to come into compatibility with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| Talk a little bit about that because that doesn't get translated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| The state regulates home daycares as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| Applicants, they go through the state process before they come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| and they'll get their state certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| and their state certification has various levels and seven children is a threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| Instead of us saying, you know what, we know better than the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| We're going to knock it down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| We said we'll be consistent with the state as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| That's fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| I want to go back to what Councilperson St. Perez asked a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| Home occupations are an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| And we were talking about the matrix, but if you look on page 9-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| the matrix deals with principal and temporary uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| and it says for accessory uses, look at Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| So have we ‑‑I just want to make sure we're answering her question correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| because is the accessory use mentioned on the matrix because it's not a principal use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7567)|
| 2:06:20| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| You hire professionals to do their job, and sometimes you have to let them do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| I'm going to trust Peter and his successor to not allow a funeral parlor to be established in my neighbor's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7590)|
| 2:06:37| There are times when we can't micromanage to that level that we have to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| Again, if we start here are the permitted uses, here are the prohibited uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| and it happens, as Councilwoman St. Perez said, when there's a new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| I want to do interstellar communications out of my home with my computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| Well, it's not listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| And so I have the opportunity to become the next Steve Jobs, and I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| And that's a little facetious, but we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| I've never been in a place where, other than here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| where there's a list of permitted and prohibited home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| I'm not sure what the benefit is when you have good operational standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| and you have a capable administrator who can work and address the concerns of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| I think that's the recommendation that I presented to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| that we leave that, improve those operational standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| leave the prohibited and permitted uses out of it because we can't address them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| My fear is more that we don't prohibit a use that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7668)|
| 2:07:54| don't explicitly prohibit a use that could be detrimental to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| and it's permitted because we don't prohibit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| because they'd hire a good attorney like you and overcome the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| And I think that's a greater fear than not listing all the permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| With these operational standards and good enforcement, we address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7692)|
| 2:08:18| But I guess the answer that was given was, look at the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| I think that provides a framework within which to improve the home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7702)|
| 2:08:31| I think we might need to address that some in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| because certainly the answer is a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| And I don't know, Peter, if you want to say anything about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| do you need some level of guidance here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| I think the guidance is that you can only have one employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| and the visibility to the neighborhood is limited by no outside residential appearance changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7726)|
| 2:08:56| no outdoor storage, no traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| nothing that's going to increase noise, vibration, glare, fumes, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| Obviously no vehicle repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| It's the things that it's kind of like, and I don't want to go down this rabbit hole too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| but the functional family and residential occupancy standards, we can't enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| We can enforce front yard parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| We can enforce noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| We can enforce the effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| And that's really what we're getting at are the effects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| which are very, you know, the exact same as what we've got in the current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| But if we've got somebody who's something other than a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7777)|
| 2:09:45| we shrug our shoulders and say, we're sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| you need to go to the planning commission to be a professional gamer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| and sit in your basement and make money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| That's just the sort of issues that we deal with, I wouldn't say on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7797)|
| 2:10:07| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| I think what the neighborhood's concern is about crime going up, a lot more traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7813)|
| 2:10:20| an undesirable business coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| But what I'm more imagining is people are making their money on letgo.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| It's retail, but it's one person at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| You're selling whatever items you might have purchased online or eBay or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7832)|
| 2:10:38| So how can we address the concern of more traffic or more crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7838)|
| 2:10:45| Are there any limitations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Like we can't set up a retail store in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| There's a provision that you can't sell things not made on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| So if you bought something on eBay and want to resell it, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| That would be, I know, not an easy enforcement issue, but it's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| So we do have that limitation there, the limitation that it can't significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| I can't remember the wording, but can't increase traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| So if the traffic, you know, you have something where people are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7874)|
| 2:11:18| I lived in a great neighborhood in another city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| We had a numbers guy down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| and the way we were able to tell was the traffic that was generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| and that's what did him in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| So I think those are ways to address those with those operational standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| You know, I just think I don't want to get in the way of someone making a living, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| And people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| I know people who make a living selling things from eBay to individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| and that's their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| So how do we address all the new, as you said a moment ago, interstellar, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| naming or whatever, how do we address as new occupations come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7911)|
| 2:11:58| I guess the answer is there can't be traffic coming to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| There can't be traffic because there's a limitation on retail sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| the noise, vibration, the operational impacts of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| Protect the neighbors, allow some use of the home for making a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| but protect the neighbors from any adverse impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| So following up on that point, what we've got now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7947)|
| 2:12:37| you're not allowed to use an accessory structure for the home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| And so let's move to Section 10.3, accessory structures and uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| And I know I talked to Gerald about this just a little bit earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| but since we just talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| I think this is an important part to look at because of the home occupations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| and the limitation about not having accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| So in the current version of RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| you would be allowed to have in a residential area, an RN1 or an RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7988)|
| 2:13:17| a shed or a garage, either one of which could be the same size as the residential dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=7997)|
| 2:13:31| So you can have a garage that's detached that's the same size as the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| as long as it doesn't encompass more than 30 percent of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| How big is your lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| I'm on page 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| Let's go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Maximum coverage of detached accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| If your lot is 15,000 square foot or less, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| I guess if you have a 750 square foot house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| that's as big as you can get for an accessory structure is 750 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| and it goes up to 1,100 square feet if you're on an acre or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| So theoretically, if you're on a big lot and you have a tiny house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| You could have 1,100 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| But the max building coverage for the entire lot was 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| So I guess what I wanted to examine here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| is there potential for someone to have a home that is the same size as their garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8067)|
| 2:14:35| and then they have a shed that's not quite the same size as the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| because it allows for multiple accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| I don't think those regulations are changing from what we have in the current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| and I think they haven't changed because there hasn't been an issue so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| These regulations are consistent with, are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| No, you took out the combined total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| Combined total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| The combined total of the accessory building and structure can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8108)|
| 2:15:15| only one of them, I think, is restricted to being the size of the dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8115)|
| 2:15:33| Where do you see combined total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| I'm looking at what we've got now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| It's 750 square foot for the building coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| Combination of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| If I could speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| There's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| The existing ordinance table includes the combined total of all detached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8154)|
| 2:16:01| Now, this is separate from ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| This is about garages and sheds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| The combined total limitation has been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| Each single outbuilding garage shed has been maintained as it is in the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8171)|
| 2:16:18| But the removal of the combined means, and the 30% lot coverage is still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8178)|
| 2:16:25| but in removing the combined means if you have a 10,000 square foot lot, as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| and a 12,000 square foot footprint of a house, so it could be two-story, 2,400 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| but say a 1,200 square foot footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| You could have two 750 square foot outbuildings and a 300 square foot outbuilding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8201)|
| 2:16:49| These would all have to be behind the front building line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| but that's probably going to take up 30% of the lot exactly and all of your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8212)|
| 2:16:59| Now, if that's what you want to live next door to, that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| The reason the combined total was put in place, and I was on council at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| because of a situation in now Mr. Campin's district and one in Ms. Welch's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8228)|
| 2:17:16| where the neighbors ended up living in the shadow of these large accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8236)|
| 2:17:23| The one in Mr. Campin's district actually was a man who had quite a bit of wealth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| built a rental house, and built a sports complex for his growing children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| so they could have indoor soccer and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| Now, he didn't live there, but the neighbors who continue to live there live in the shadow of that building today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| and that was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| I think we can add some language to item number six that talks about the maximum coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8271)|
| 2:17:58| and just adding it shall not exceed the square footage of the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| Right. I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| Council, we have questioned and made remarks about the policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| Now, I need to ask Mr. Green, what questions have we not addressed that you would like for us to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8293)|
| 2:18:20| You've gotten all mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| I would, again, ask Council if you want to get down in the weeds on any part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8304)|
| 2:18:33| please contact me and I can work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| Peter, I speak with him, he's been more than willing to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| If we need to sit down and go over specific items that you want to get into a lot of detail on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| just let us know and we'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| Again, in getting ready for the next workshop, we are consolidating all our comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| so if you could get them to us sooner, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| Having said that, I'll be gone from Friday until March 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| Don't blame me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| I'll be somewhere where I'll be wrestling the opportunity to wrestle real alligators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| rather than the ones I've been wrestling with for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| Not the ones up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| Not the ones up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| Not the ones up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| Well, you guys are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| And ladies, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Then we are down to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| Councilwoman Wilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8379)|
| 2:19:40| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| So I just wanted to kind of throw out an idea for council to chew on a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| and maybe if you have some thoughts or ideas about this, I would appreciate hearing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| One of the things that I think we've really talked about throughout this process with RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| is that what comes to us and what we approve will be a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| It is a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| And it's not going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| I mean, I know that we would all like for it to be perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| but the likelihood is that whether it's the map or whether it's a tool that needs to be tweaked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| that those things will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| There's also quite a bit of concern given the amount of change that the zoning ordinance is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8420)|
| 2:20:29| So one of the things I'd like to consider, like us to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| is utilizing the stakeholder advisory committee that's already been in place for the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| It's a pretty diverse group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| It represents different sectors of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8442)|
| 2:20:48| It's a group that's very familiar with the existing proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| and so it wouldn't be a huge, steep learning curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| assuming that what we adopt isn't drastically different from what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| I've discussed this with Gerald and with Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| and a couple of members of the stakeholder advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| if that would be useful to keep that group together, maybe rather than having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| This was appointed by the mayor, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| So I would propose establishing the continuation of this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8479)|
| 2:21:26| with some recommended guidelines for their role over a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8486)|
| 2:21:34| and I would like to do that by resolution perhaps rather than through administrative appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8494)|
| 2:21:40| just because we will be crossing over into a new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| But generally the idea would be to have a group that would meet quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8504)|
| 2:21:50| and that would be responsible for intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| and proactively understanding the implications of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8513)|
| 2:22:01| So some of the concerns that have been raised about changes in commercial design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8521)|
| 2:22:07| or design standards for duplexes or allowing duplexes by special use permit in certain zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8527)|
| 2:22:16| what are the impacts of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| Are there neighborhood concerns that are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| the mapping issues that have been addressed that we've discussed potentially looking strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| at how to map some of these new residential zones into our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| That may be something that this group could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| So there may be other ideas, some things that we're particularly concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| that we would want to task a certain group, this group, to come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| and, hey, could you take a look at this and get back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| and let us know has there been an unintended consequence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8566)|
| 2:22:51| And I would propose for two years that this group would meet quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| but of course that's all open for discussion and input by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| So we're going to have another workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| and we're going to talk about administrative review and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| and the things that we haven't covered in these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| And it will be after the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| Well, it will be probably late March or in early April sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| It depends on when we receive the next edition of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8603)|
| 2:23:31| And then, of course, we have that spring break for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| so it will probably be in late March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| We're working on the schedule, Will and I are, and Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| so we need as many of us here as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| That does bring up a thing, and Seema, this may be directed at you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| because Thursdays are our normal day to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| and we've moved this one on purpose so that you could make sure you could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| I know in mid-April you would become available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| but before that can you make arrangements to make one of those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| On Thursdays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| On Thursday nights it's mandatory that I be at my other job from 5.30 until 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8649)|
| 2:24:15| But we'll still be in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| I'll come down then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8658)|
| 2:24:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| So we are now down to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| Vice Mayor, I have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| So I wanted to go back to what Councilperson Welch was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| I think having the advisory board continue to meet is a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| and basically I think what you're looking at there is as we see reports of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| that maybe are amiss, it can be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| because I think we've talked about this living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| We need to know about those immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| and Council needs to be committed to address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| so I think that's a fantastic idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8696)|
| 2:24:57| The other thing I was going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| unless anyone else wants to talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| is I wanted Council to think about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| or not we should add a zoning district between RN1 and RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| If you think about it, 80% of all the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| or maybe more than that, pretty close to that, is residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| and the vast majority of that is R1, R1E, and R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| We're taking the vast majority of the vast majority of the residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8723)|
| 2:25:31| and putting them from three things into two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| and we talked about some of the issues early on tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| about how the infrastructure in some of these areas differs from others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| and how putting everything into kind of a one-size-fits-all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| may not be the best thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| and I think we addressed a few of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| So I'd like everyone to take some time and think about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| for when we get together again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| because that might be a good solution there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| is to look at whether or not we need one more section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Question of Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| Do we have an analysis of how many parcels are zoned one way in the current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8775)|
| 2:26:22| like how many R1, how many R1As versus what becomes in the field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| I'm not demanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| Currently, here, I just happen to have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8791)|
| 2:26:37| Currently, and this is something we've identified some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8797)|
| 2:26:44| that have not made it to the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| but 5.8% of the residential zones are established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| 59.6% are R1, 20.2% are R2, 4.2% are R3, 1.6% are R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8812)|
| 2:27:01| That will increase because we've found several new parcels are R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| 4.2% are R5, 4.3% are R6, and 0.1% are R7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| So do we know how that compares to the current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| Not yet, but we can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| Without undue staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| We can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| And I should be able to have that for you, email it to you tomorrow afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| Because on that note, a lot of neighborhoods in my district that are R1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| are becoming RN2, 3, 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| They're not necessarily RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| They're much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Yeah, and that goes back to trying to strategically map areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| for multifamily in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| We want change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| We want progress, but we definitely don't want change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| I'm not going to argue with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| Any other comments by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| Mr. Ahrens has a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| Scott Elder works with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| He's our zoning chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| He's been around longer than I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| and he was indicating that the home office is relatively new around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| 2014 era,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| and I'm wondering if council would like to see those distinctions between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| home office, which is primarily you're working in your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| and you have nobody come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| versus a home occupation that has potentially one employee as it's set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8912)|
| 2:28:38| currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| Is there a desire to have those distinctions as we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| I mean, I think they are different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| so I would suggest leaving it basically as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8927)|
| 2:28:54| In the current code or in recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| Let me be really clear, because it's easy not to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| In the current ordinance today that's enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| I would suggest leaving the distinction and having to the extent that after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| your review, you know, it can functionally be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| I think that's what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8960)|
| 2:29:21| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| Councilwoman Singh Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| I think that Councilman Roberto and I and you need to sit down and hash out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| We wouldn't be able to because of the sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| I'll sit with him and then you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| Yeah, well, you all can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| You all can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| We are at the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| and I noticed Ms. Feld would like to make a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| but would you mind if I put you number 10 and just put you on the forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| So we're here at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| We have 10 people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| In the interest of time, and it's now 814,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| I would recommend we reduce the time to three minutes apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| Did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| So first on the list is Deborah Thomas, if she is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9008)|
| 2:30:09| If you would come up and you have three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| and please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| My name is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| I live at 428 East Burwell Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| I will try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| I didn't plan a five-minute speech anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| Thank you for allowing me to speak and having this workshop for citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| Many of you know me as a neighborhood advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| I'm currently also serving as the interim co-chair of Broadway Corridor Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| so I'm not a single issue speaker here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| I've been following the city policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| and how those impact our neighborhoods from a broader perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| Speaking as an informed neighbor tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| you can get feedback on what's happening in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| The overwhelming sentiment from neighbors in our area is to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| RN-4 zoning as a blanket zoning over existing single-family housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9054)|
| 2:30:59| and I believe that the staff has done a good job with trying to hear what neighborhoods are saying about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9059)|
| 2:31:05| There hasn't been enough feedback as far as the subtle changes to the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| There are a few details I would like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| The lot size for RN-2 and RN-3 has been manipulated during the several versions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| in relation to two-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| For RN-2, it changed from 10,000 square feet in the first versions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| to 7,500 square feet in the December version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| For RN-3, it changed from 7,000 square feet to 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| So the numbers are going up and down if you look at that graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| There needs to be some consistency here and maybe decreasing square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| as the density gets greater in the RN-4 density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| My comment is that for two-family lots, the lot might need to be 8,000 to 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9100)|
| 2:31:45| for RN-2 and RN-3, particularly as this relates to historic-era neighborhoods like ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| and that includes Oakwood-Lincoln Park, Old North, Fourth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| Edgewood, Fairmont and Moreland, Park Ridge, and Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| The lot size can be decreased or stay at the 7,500 square foot for RN-4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9119)|
| 2:32:05| My other concern is the increase in the maximum lot size for RN-4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9125)|
| 2:32:10| which happened in the October version of the RECO draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| There's no indication that a change has been made in the December draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| There's no cross-through or change in the text color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| That change is from 40,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| It was originally 15,000 square feet and goes up to 40,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| So if you're looking at blanket RN zoning and then changing that maximum lot size to 40,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9148)|
| 2:32:38| that's half a block for a lot of our areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| Yeah, thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9162)|
| 2:32:43| Okay, next is Ron Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| Is Mr. Davis still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| If you'd please come to the mic and give us your name and address, and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| You can see it on the screen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| My name is Ron Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| I live at 4321 Skyline Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| And we are rental property owners, and I'm also a member of the NAACP Housing Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9182)|
| 2:33:13| A picture is worth a thousand words, and we, being the NAACP, are very much concerned about the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9193)|
| 2:33:22| and its possible adverse impact on African Americans and other vulnerable groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9202)|
| 2:33:31| Looking at the map, we ask ourselves, and we're asking you, where are vulnerable people going to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9211)|
| 2:33:42| We want the recode policy to be a win-win for our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9222)|
| 2:33:47| Some of our thinking has been informed by past uses of zoning rules to segregate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9227)|
| 2:33:58| We want to value people above property, and we want to encourage policies that put people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9238)|
| 2:34:07| That's basically what I just want to kind of just put out there to share with you guys as you deliberate recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| This is Ms. Malone, Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9256)|
| 2:34:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| I'll just speak about the square footage in the RN-2 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9270)|
| 2:34:37| One of the things to consider is, for decades, 7,500 square feet was the minimum lot size for a single family detached in R1, R1E, R1A, R2 zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9277)|
| 2:34:52| What we've now done, or proposed, is 10,000 square feet for RN-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| And originally, the first draft of recode said 7,000 for RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9298)|
| 2:35:05| In moving to 10,000 square feet for RN-1, all of the housing, all of the lots in the city of Knoxville that were developed around the minimum square footage of 7,500 suddenly go down to 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9305)|
| 2:35:23| If they're not 10,000, they're five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| There's a big gap between 10,000 and 5,000, especially when the minimum was 7,500 for 40, 50, 60 years, and most housing was built around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9327)|
| 2:35:42| And yes, as Mr. Green properly pointed out, the footage along the street would have to be a certain amount in order to subdivide a lot and make an existing 10,000 into two fives or two 7,500s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9342)|
| 2:36:02| take down the houses, put them together, and have three 5,000 square foot lots, which is how we lose our existing character and our existing housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9362)|
| 2:36:12| And Mr. Green points out you have to have a street footage of a certain amount, and most don't have 100, but all you need is 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9372)|
| 2:36:20| Because if you have a 75 by 100 foot depth lot, you combine them or whatever, but say you have actually a 10,000 square foot lot with only 75, you can have what's called a flagpole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9380)|
| 2:36:37| And put a 10,000 square foot, turn it into two lots with a flagpole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9397)|
| 2:36:45| Again, this is the kind of problem we need to look for unintended consequences on our older established neighborhoods, some of which were mentioned, some of which are in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9405)|
| 2:36:58| and they have provided the affordable backbone of our community as far as housing goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9418)|
| 2:37:05| And so I think you need to look carefully at why the 7,000 first draft for RN2 became five, and looking at this all together, if it needs to go back to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9425)|
| 2:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| Next is Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9443)|
| 2:37:28| If you would please give us your name and address, and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, speaking as Chairperson of Community Forum tonight, and also a member of the West Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9454)|
| 2:37:42| At the last workshop, I made a few comments, and even though I know you heard them then, I'm going to repeat some of that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9462)|
| 2:37:51| At the last workshop, I suggested that the next draft of recode should not come out until after the final workshop, so that the comments from City Council members and the public would then be included in that final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9471)|
| 2:38:06| The way we've announced it tonight, we're not doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| I think that there's going to be lots of comments and suggestions at what either is the last workshop or whenever the last workshop is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9489)|
| 2:38:17| I just think you ought to reconsider that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| I think it would be much more efficient for everybody to get all the comments from workshops into the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9500)|
| 2:38:27| And then there still may be amendments at some future City Council special session to vote on things, but I just think it makes a lot more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9507)|
| 2:38:35| Okay, number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| I hope most of you read the article that Nick Dell-Volpe wrote yesterday at Knox 10 Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| It's titled Residential Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| What vision are we pursuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| I think that while there's been some discussion tonight on that topic, there hasn't been enough discussion by all of the members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9529)|
| 2:38:58| I think collectively, you all need to say that, whatever it is you think that vision is on these topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9538)|
| 2:39:04| Some of you have expressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| A lot of you have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| And I just think that is such an important thing that has to be done by City Council members before you adopt whatever it is that ends up being adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9547)|
| 2:39:16| Last thing is, and I said this before and you've probably heard me say it or write it several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| what is the rationale for making significant changes from the existing ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9561)|
| 2:39:28| I believe that City Council members must understand what the stated rationale is and either agree or disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9568)|
| 2:39:39| But you have to know, why are we not leaving certain things alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| Like home occupation and several other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| Our comments from community forum have addressed that in many places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| Some places the fix is easy, just leave the existing language alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9591)|
| 2:39:56| If we're going to change it, there ought to be a good reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| And I'm not sure that any of us understand what those rationales are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9599)|
| 2:40:04| So I think this has been a good session tonight and I hope we can continue this process of dialogue with the community and our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9604)|
| 2:40:12| who are speaking out and are very concerned about some of these issues that you all have addressed tonight and I assume will be addressed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9612)|
| 2:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| Next is Bonnie Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| Bonnie Jones, is she still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| If not, the next is Debbie Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9631)|
| 2:40:36| There's Miss Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9636)|
| 2:40:41| If you would please give us your name and address and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9641)|
| 2:40:49| My name is Debbie Phillips and I live at 1307 Michaels Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| The American dream of owning a home is to have large yards for our children to play in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| to have driveways for our vehicles to be in when we have family and relatives to come and visit Christmas, Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9661)|
| 2:41:10| and a place for our gardens, a place to relax and enjoy our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9670)|
| 2:41:15| What this recode is doing is it's reducing the size of the land where people have just a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9675)|
| 2:41:26| As people that have boats and trailers and campers for children to take them on camping trips or vacations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9686)|
| 2:41:36| those are going to have to have a fence from the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| Put a fence over them to where nobody can see that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| Would you not rather see that camper sitting, nice camper sitting in my backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9704)|
| 2:41:49| or would you like to see a big privacy fence around it that's just, it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| and are we people that already have our land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| Are we grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| Or do I have to make my house look like yours or yours and we all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9719)|
| 2:42:06| what this is doing is trying to make Knoxville look, everybody look alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| It's for a lot of the younger generation that don't have children yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| Once they get children, you know, this is not going to work because then they're going to be moving out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9736)|
| 2:42:22| to find them homes where their children can have backyards and they can have gardens and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9742)|
| 2:42:28| And if these younger folks that don't have the children, they want an area like this, keep it downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9748)|
| 2:42:35| We don't need the government trying to take us homeowners who pay taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| and shove some kind of government control down our throats, secret, or, well, just fast, quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9760)|
| 2:42:49| and then all of a sudden we hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| And, you know, if, what this is, it's just, it's socialism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| It wants every one of us to be alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| That's not what we are here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| And if that's what those people want, maybe Knoxville is not for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9782)|
| 2:43:07| And there's just too many things in that thing there that just contradicts each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9787)|
| 2:43:13| and I think it just needs to, I mean, why fix something if it's not broke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9793)|
| 2:43:19| And you said you were a realtor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| Do you know what's going to happen or that you have been in real estate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| No, I'm not a realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| You've been in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| I think you're confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| I thought you said something about real estate when I was down here earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| but, you know, what it's going to do in 10, 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9814)|
| 2:43:38| those structures are going to be sitting there because they can't get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| Thank you, Ms. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9825)|
| 2:43:46| I just think we need to just review this more, be more open with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| You know, let's not push something so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| Thank you very much for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| Bob Pwetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9837)|
| 2:44:13| They let you back in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| My name is Bob Pwetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| I live at 1015 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| I'm the chairman of the subcommittee on Forth and Gill for codes and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| so I'm kind of here speaking in that group tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| But I think some of the comments will be relevant to other inner city neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| in and around Forth and Gill, Old North, Park Ridge, things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9869)|
| 2:44:33| In our neighborhood, basically, we're happy with where we are in the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| except for the size of the duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| We're very happy to see the multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| and the mixed use come on Broadway, Central, Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9882)|
