| 0:01:41| Thank you. Thank you, Council Members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| We want to thank everyone who's joining and watching this workshop of City Council on our homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| I want to thank all of our guests that are here this evening with us that will be presenting and all of those who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| I would like to say in advance of public forum that we would ask that you not use profanity, that you not use personal attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| We welcome your comments and your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| This is an opportunity for you to share with Council, hopefully on this particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| But again, you have the right to speak to us, regardless of anything of your topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| It is not a two-way dialogue, so Council does not respond back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| But we welcome your comments and feedback for those who have signed up to speak to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| At this time, I'd now like to turn this presentation over to Deputy Chief Stephanie Welch, who will lead us in this discussion and presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=145)|
| 0:02:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor, and good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| It's very good to see you here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| I basically am going to just give you a couple of logistics for the evening and turn it over to Mayor India Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| So, first of all, again, thank you so much for spending time this afternoon and into the evening on what is a very important topic for our city and for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=171)|
| 0:03:04| The City Council has not had a workshop on homelessness in a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| And we know from the last workshop that it was a long one, and there's a lot to go over this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| So, I just want to thank you all in advance for your time and attention to this important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| It is likely that the workshop will go beyond two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| So, I would just like to let everyone know that I'll be asking Vice Mayor McKenzie for a break around the two-hour mark so that everyone can stretch and do what they need to do to keep their minds alert for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=208)|
| 0:03:43| And then, if needed, we will schedule another break after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| So, for those who are on both the Zoom and listening at home, just do realize that we will have a couple of breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| There are a lot of people on this call. There will be some presenters both from the city and from partner organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| I will be keeping my eyes open for hands raised and questions along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| So, if you do have questions, know that there is a lot of material to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| But we want to take as much time as Council needs to ask questions and to understand the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| And then, there will be a public forum at the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| So, tonight's workshop, again, as the Vice Mayor said, is really for Council and for Council to understand the strategy that the city deploys for addressing this really important issue and to ask your questions and provide your feedback to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=266)|
| 0:04:43| So, with that said, I'm really pleased to be here tonight and to introduce, turn it over to Mayor India Kankanen who has a few comments before the workshop starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=283)|
| 0:04:58| Thanks so much, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Good to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you for calling this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| Thank you to the community partners and staff members for participating in this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| There's little doubt that homelessness is one of the most difficult issues cities face and an unacceptable circumstance for anyone in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=310)|
| 0:05:19| Although many of the primary causes of homelessness are not directly controlled by the city government, our local community is where this crisis occurs and where we must work together to address this important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=319)|
| 0:05:32| There are many individuals and organizations doing good and important work to help people who are homeless or who are at risk of becoming homeless right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| And you're going to hear from several of these organizations today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| My administration is committed to continuing and increasing this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| It is important to keep in mind that the city of Knoxville is not a homeless services provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| We do not own, we do not operate shelter or housing, and we do not provide direct social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| We do work to support and coordinate the partners in our community who have a direct mission to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| It is incredibly distressing to see and know that people in Knoxville are literally living in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| Along with our partners, we're working hard every day to engage with and help the unsheltered homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| You're probably aware that the majority of people experiencing homelessness in our community often go unseen because they're inside the walls of our partner organizations, sheltered and engaged with social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=376)|
| 0:06:28| The goal is to help every individual access permanent, stable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| Ultimately, the solution to homelessness is housing, outreach, case management, behavioral health and other resources are critical to solving this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=393)|
| 0:06:42| But for these efforts to succeed, we must be committed to increasing the availability of appropriate housing throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| This includes a commitment to increasing the number of units of permanent supportive housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| Permanent supportive housing is a proven successful way for helping people with significant underlying difficulties to permanently move off the streets and with the help of onsite social services, live healthier and more fulfilling lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=414)|
| 0:07:07| We know this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| I'm committed to creating more permanent supportive housing in Knoxville, and we will need the strong support of every member of city council to break down barriers and make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| I'm grateful for city council's interest in homelessness, for your commitment to addressing it, for calling this workshop, and to learning more about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| I'm going to turn the workshop over to city staff and partners who will present more detail about the nature of this challenge, the considerable work that is being done to address it, and about new and expanded efforts that we will undertake moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=446)|
| 0:07:39| Before I turn this over to Becky Wade, I want to let you know that just this week, we were notified that the Tennessee Housing Development Agency has selected the city of Knoxville for a Tennessee Best Award for our use of Continuum of Care funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=459)|
| 0:07:51| Specifically, this is a director award in recognition of Mike Dunthorne's work to create affordable housing opportunities and for the use of Continuum of Care funds to impact the lives of so many who are struggling to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=471)|
| 0:08:04| To Mike and all the partners in the Continuum of Care, thank you for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Now I'm going to turn it over to Director Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Becky, please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you all of council for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| I want to start by introducing Mike Dunthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| Congratulations, Mike, on your award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Mike's been involved with the Office of Homelessness for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| I also would like to introduce Sean Griffith, who is a new member of the Office on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| They will be doing the majority of the presentation this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| The Office of Homelessness is housed in the Department of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| We receive a formula-based annual allocation of funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| One of the programs through which we receive funds is the Emergency Solutions Grants, or ESG program, focused on homelessness services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=536)|
| 0:09:06| This is a small amount annually, less than $150,000, and must be focused on activities that address homelessness, such as shelter services, rapid rehousing, homeless prevention, street outreach, or data management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=546)|
| 0:09:22| You'll hear more about these programs later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| The City of Knoxville also provides general funds to support these activities, and grants are provided to agencies that serve homeless individuals and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=566)|
| 0:09:37| Our department manages these grants and includes information about homelessness in our annual action plan and reports accomplishments yearly through our Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report, or CAPER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=577)|
| 0:09:55| We include the number of people served and other accomplishments in that report, and that's able to be accessed through our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| Additionally, we staff the continuum of care, and specifically Mike Dunthorne has staffed that for years, and submits the annual application for those funds that go directly to agencies from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=604)|
| 0:10:17| We also convene the quarterly meeting of the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness to coordinate the leadership of all homeless-serving agencies to share information and set priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=617)|
| 0:10:31| Understanding that to adequately address the issue of homelessness, more affordable housing, and more specifically, more permanent supportive housing is needed, the City launched the Affordable Rental Development Fund in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=631)|
| 0:10:47| Since then, $3.2 million of that fund has been obligated for permanent supportive housing projects, creating 108 new apartments with supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=647)|
| 0:11:01| Since these projects serve the very lowest-income households in the community, they require numerous sources of funding to get built, and they can also take many, many months to get through the public approvals process before they can get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=661)|
| 0:11:16| For an example, Caswell Manor, just to get through the public approvals process was 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| That's prior to any kind of activity on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| We intend in the coming year to provide more funding for permanent supportive housing, because we know that that's a successful way that people on the street can have productive and successful lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=689)|
| 0:11:42| I want to turn it over now to Mike and Sean, who will start the workshop. Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| Thank you, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Sean, I think is going to share a screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| And we will dive in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| I will go over on the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| First, I want to thank the mayor and Becky and city council and all of the providers that are on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| This is a team effort on all counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| It's hard work, difficult challenge, but it's really important that we're all at the table working on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| So, Sean, if you want to go to the first slide, I'll just kind of go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| I was just going to take a moment just to introduce myself as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Just since I'm new to the Office on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Thank you, council, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| My name is Sean Griffith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I wanted to take a moment to provide some background, kind of what I'm bringing to the Office on Homelessness now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| I'm a former disaster-based homelessness researcher, and my background is in applied anthropology and ecology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=773)|
| 0:13:02| I conducted ethnographic field work with Houston's unsheltered homeless population after Hurricane Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| And I'm a former street outreach worker here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So I carry a lot of this with me into this work, and specifically in working with our unsheltered homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| And we'll be talking a lot about just homelessness in general and our unsheltered homeless population tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| So go ahead, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Yeah, thank you, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| And it really is fantastic to have him on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| He brings a lot to this, and it's going to up our game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| So I'm grateful to have him on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| So we've done the introductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Coming up, we'll talk about what's called the continuum of care and give an overview of what that is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=826)|
| 0:13:55| We'll talk about the city's plan to address homelessness and then go into the coordinated entry system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=835)|
| 0:14:03| which is a way to try to help people navigate the system and get through a pipeline to the right place in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=843)|
| 0:14:14| We'll review statistics about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| That is always complex and complicated to understand, but we'll try to boil it down and make it make sense to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=859)|
| 0:14:28| We'll talk about our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| We'll talk about the COVID-19 response, which has added a whole new layer of complications to this issue over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=871)|
| 0:14:40| And we will have a number of our partners and providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| The folks that are doing the real work on this issue are going to talk about what their organizations are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| and what their experiences are out there serving this population and working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| And then finally, we'll talk about our priorities to address gaps in services and resources over the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=897)|
| 0:15:11| All right, I'm going to take a moment just to contextualize homelessness for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| and talk about how complex of a topic this is to really talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| And I want to take a moment to talk about how homelessness is systemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| It is not a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| It is a result of policy that has come down from the federal and state-level government since the 1980s where we've had deinstitutionalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=935)|
| 0:15:45| We've had mass incarceration that has been racially biased towards people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| We've had structural racism and combined with housing restrictions that prevent individuals to engage with the criminal justice system from moving into certain housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=951)|
| 0:16:07| And then you combine that with an economic system that has produced a lack of affordable housing and stagnant wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| And this is where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| In the United States, we have roughly half a million individuals who are on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| With all that combined together, we also have to add the fact that these individuals suffer from mental illness and addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=983)|
| 0:16:33| And many times, these are comorbid, which means they're occurring simultaneously for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| On top of all that, you have folks who are also suffering from severe physical health issues that compound all these factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=999)|
| 0:16:48| And then on top of that as well, a lot of these individuals bring with them past and present trauma that has affected their lives very, very deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1008)|
| 0:16:58| And the result is a highly vulnerable and marginalized population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| But I'll also add the caveat that it is a highly resilient population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| And this population is operating under a moral economy where social bonds and community are built off survival and meeting immediate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1029)|
| 0:17:21| However, unsheltered homelessness is far from an egalitarian, utopian space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| And I know a lot of folks out there talk about mutual aid within this population and how there's a lot of support structures and individuals supporting one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| But what is also occurring in these spaces is that it's hierarchical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| There's predation that happens in these spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| There's victimization and intra-homeless violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| And so these spaces can be very challenging for individuals to live in and not always a safe space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| And what we need to realize is that local government ends up dealing a lot with the fallout of federal and state policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| And I'll let Mike talk about the no single solution portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| Right. So, I mean, there is an incredible diversity of folks that deal with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| And that means that there also has to be a diversity of solutions to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| And as the mayor said at the top and we've referenced here, so many of the factors that contribute to it are things that happen outside our direct control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1105)|
| 0:18:35| But they roll downhill, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| And cities are left with the job of trying to figure out how we manage this, how we bend the curve and how we help folks that find themselves in great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1118)|
| 0:18:49| We're no different than any other city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| I stay in touch with my peers across the state and talk to others outside of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| And, you know, we're all struggling with this and we're all struggling with it under the pandemic in this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| And each community, you know, we each have our own state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| We have our own local regulations, our own local issues that manifest themselves on top of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| But it's all, it all combines to a complex issue that requires complex answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| The start of that, I guess we'll jump to the next slide and I will talk about the continuum of care, which begins to provide some context for the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1162)|
| 0:19:33| And that is, so the continuum of care is a concept under the Department of Housing and Urban Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| You see this quote here, collaborative funding and planning approach that helps communities plan for and provide as necessary a full range of emergency transitional and permanent housing and other service resources to address various needs of homeless persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1181)|
| 0:19:57| The continuum of care concept was created under the McKinney-Vento Act back in the late 1980s as really HUD's funding stream for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1197)|
| 0:20:12| Fairly early on in that, after passing that act, they began asking communities to self-define their areas, in our case, Knoxville and Knox County, and start looking at gaps in resources and what our local needs are in order to ask for funding from HUD to meet some of those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1212)|
| 0:20:36| That is a process that goes year after year and HUD modifies it and adds layers to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| In fact, in 2009, they codified it in federal law under the Hearth Act, but the gist of it is that it asks each community or region to take a look every year at their needs, at what they are able to do, what they are doing, and at what the holes in the system still are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1244)|
| 0:21:08| It asks communities to coordinate with each other because, as it is here, it is across the country, you have a lot of folks that step up to deal with the issue and the natural state is not necessarily for them to always talk to each other or work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1268)|
| 0:21:28| That is a process that goes year after year and HUD modifies it and adds layers to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1288)|
| 0:21:54| That is a process that goes year after year and HUD modifies it and adds layers to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| That is a process that goes year after year and HUD modifies it and adds layers to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1322)|
| 0:22:11| That is a process that goes year after year and HUD modifies it and adds layers to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| That is a process that goes year after year and HUD modifies it and adds layers to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1337)|
| 0:22:26| We have the community action committee, again, providing a slew of different resources from rapid rehousing to supporting homeless families and homeless youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| We have our Helen Ross McNab Center, which I believe is now just known as the McNab Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| They provide behavioral health services here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| We have the Salvation Army, which runs a domestic violence emergency shelter, as well as transitional housing for homeless men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| We have the Knoxville Leadership Foundation, which has a workforce development program targeted towards homeless youth, but also focuses on permanent supportive housing and runs Plinican Landing in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1374)|
| 0:23:11| We have Knoxville's Community Development Corporation, which is our public housing authority here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| We have the YWCA, which also runs a transitional housing program for women in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| Volunteers of America focuses on homeless veterans and actually acts as an entry point for our coordinated entry system, which I forgot to add for a couple of our other providers, but we'll get to that again later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1405)|
| 0:23:40| Then we have Veterans Affairs for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| The Knox County Health Department is beginning to play a crucial role in homelessness and homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| They've added new outreach workers that are focused on harm reduction and community spread of communicable diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1431)|
| 0:24:04| The University of Tennessee actually is who houses our homeless management information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| This is unique for a COC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| A lot of times COCs have their own HMIS staff within their lead agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| So this is another level of collaboration that we have with the University of Tennessee that we're very grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| And UT also houses our coordinated entry system and the CHAMP coordinator, who will also be speaking later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1465)|
| 0:24:35| Then we have the United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| They've always been a key player in this world, but most recently they've added the House Knox program, which has added housing navigators to our system that work towards increasing our private housing inventory, which is very crucial for our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1479)|
| 0:24:56| And then lastly, we have the Knoxville Police Department, who plays a crucial role that we'll get into later as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1496)|
| 0:25:06| And just to give everyone an understanding of the breadth, or albatross, if you will, of programs and services for homeless individuals that the Knoxville-Knox County Homeless Coalition and Mike and I are trying to coordinate with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1506)|
| 0:25:28| there's over 100 plus programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| And so this is really why HUD established Continuum of Cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| They wanted to make sure that all of this was being done in a coordinated, integrated manner where certain agencies were doing what they do best and not having duplication of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1537)|
| 0:25:50| And I'm not going to take the time to read off every single one of these for you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| And you should have these on the slides that were sent out to you for you to reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| But the point is for you all to see just the sheer number of different services that are out there to support our homeless community in some capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1562)|
| 0:26:14| I'm going to let Mike take over for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| So we do have a plan in place, the City of Knoxville's plan to address homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| Prior to the current plan, you may recall the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness that started under the Haslam administration, which focused on chronic homelessness and on what was then a fairly new best practice concept called Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1585)|
| 0:26:45| When Mayor Rojero came in, we regrouped and relooked at everything and really broadened the scope of what we wanted our community plan to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1605)|
| 0:26:58| And so that was adopted by City Council in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| Housing First still remains a key concept at the heart of all this, and that gets to the permanent support of housing that we have referenced and we will continue referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1623)|
| 0:27:17| And that simply, if you haven't heard of Housing First, is a concept of rather than making somebody step through a graduated system of resources before they can ever get anywhere close to having a permanent place to live again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1637)|
| 0:27:33| you work with them and try to get them into permanent housing as quickly as possible, and then provide the wraparound services that they need in order to sustain that housing and to live a better life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1653)|
| 0:27:49| We're continuing our emphasis on a systems approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| As you saw on the previous slide, there are an enormous number of agencies and organizations and people who care about this issue, and that's important, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1673)|
| 0:28:05| But we have to, because of that, work together and look at our overall system of how we deal with this issue and do everything that we can, not only to make sure that we're using our resources to the best ability that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1685)|
| 0:28:23| but also making sure that we create a system that someone who finds themselves at risk of homelessness or finds themselves literally homeless, that they're able to navigate through that system and come out on the other end, back in housing and back living a better life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1703)|
| 0:28:41| Over the previous plan, we shifted our focus away from the theoretical idea of ending homelessness to the actionable principle that homelessness is not an acceptable circumstance for anyone in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1721)|
| 0:28:55| It's a short sentence, but it really encapsulates what certainly drives me and I think drives all of our partners on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| Ending homelessness is an aspirational goal, but when you talk about we're going to end homelessness for veterans or we're going to end homelessness for chronically homeless folks, if you don't explain yourself very quickly, one, a lot of people won't even take you seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1743)|
| 0:29:22| And then two, even if you make great strides in improving our resources and housing folks in those populations, if you haven't ended homelessness for everyone, people will look at it and say, well, you haven't done anything, and that's not the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1762)|
| 0:29:42| And so we really want to keep focused on improving our system and centering it around the idea that homelessness is not an acceptable circumstance for anyone in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1782)|
| 0:29:52| So in our plan, we have these five categories that mirrored the federal plan at the time that we created this local iteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1792)|
| 0:30:05| The first is just providing leadership, collaboration, and civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| We've talked about that. We'll talk about it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Doing what you can to improve the crisis response system so that you respond to people in crisis, but you don't make it chronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| You don't make their homelessness chronic, and you don't make your solutions to it only deal with the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| Number three is critical, and you're going to keep hearing more about that, and that is create and maintain access to a variety of decent, appropriate, affordable, permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1830)|
| 0:30:41| It seems like a no-brainer, but sometimes it gets lost in the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| Housing is the answer to homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| There's a lot else that we have to do to make that work, but housing is how you end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| We want to increase economic opportunities for people, whether that's helping people find their way back to employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| or whether it's helping people who qualify for disability income to get that income so that those resources can then help pay for their housing and for their needs and help us help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1862)|
| 0:31:17| Finally, we want to improve health and stability for people experiencing homelessness or who are at risk, and that includes physical and behavioral health, because those are, as we've said, such significant contributing factors to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1877)|
| 0:31:34| Since we created that plan, just a few insights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| We actually have made significant progress towards the goals that were outlined in the initial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| There's a matrix in the back of that plan, and if you go through it, you'll see that a large portion of the things that we identified that we wanted to do or things that we have either done or we're making significant headway working on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1906)|
| 0:32:00| Street homelessness is the most visible aspect of this issue. It is and always will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| That's what the public sees. It's an incredibly important part of this issue, and we're going to outline things that we want to do to continue to improve how we address that portion of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1927)|
| 0:32:20| But it also overshadows the greater amount of work that happens outside of public view of the people who are inside the walls of the providers that you're going to hear from shortly who are getting help and are finding their way out of homelessness and back into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1940)|
| 0:32:37| Appropriate affordable permanent housing continues to be the critical primary gap that's at the end of the pipeline. If you want people off the street, you have to have some place for them to live. And so we need to really redouble our commitment to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1957)|
| 0:32:57| And that includes working our way through community opposition, which is a frequent roadblock. It's easy to get people to agree in concept to permanent supportive housing. We've shown that it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1977)|
| 0:33:10| We've shown that it actually costs the community less to help someone with permanent supportive housing and help them live there than it does for them to remain on the street and cycle through all of the various systems that they cycle through while they remain on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=1990)|
| 0:33:28| So we have to redouble our commitment to say, we need permanent housing, we need permanent supportive housing, and we need it in places throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2008)|
| 0:33:38| All right. I want to take a moment to give some background on coordinated entry and what a coordinated entry system is. I'd like to remind or inform council that this is also codified by HUD and a requirement for a COC to continue receiving federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2018)|
| 0:34:00| And what a coordinated entry system's goals are is to increase crisis response system efficiency. And what that means is that we're increasing collaboration and we're streamlining processes. We're hoping to increase equity and access to resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2040)|
| 0:34:20| Prioritize those in most need of assistance when that means that we in many times are prioritizing those who are most vulnerable. And then we are generating service gap information to strategically allocate funding and identify additional resource needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2060)|
| 0:34:40| And how that's done is essentially by knowing how many individuals score for certain types of housing resources. So whether that is permanent supportive housing, whether that's rapid rehousing, diversion, and so on and so forth, which we'll get a little bit more into later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2080)|
| 0:34:59| But by knowing the number of individuals who score in certain areas, we can then project out where we need to allocate funding to keep up with inflow of the homeless population over a given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2099)|
| 0:35:14| So this is kind of a theoretical understanding of what coordinated entry is supposed to do. Prior to coordinated entry, you have individuals who are becoming homeless and they're hitting certain service providers in different areas. And then they are trying to navigate their way to permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2114)|
| 0:35:36| And what coordinated entry attempts to do is to streamline that process by funneling everyone to the same single housing pipeline. They're all assessed with the same assessment. And then they're scored and referred to their particular type of housing that is appropriate to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2136)|
| 0:35:56| And what this takes is a large level of collaboration for the entire community and service providers and getting everyone on board to understand what their role is, how they can perform their role well, and how we can maximize a limited amount of federal funding resources, local funding resources, state level, as well as local funding resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2156)|
| 0:36:25| And how we can prioritize who has limited housing stock and how we can prioritize who, how we can equitably prioritize who gets certain housing that is available in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2185)|
| 0:36:39| So the way that coordinated entry system to function well, as we will continue to reiterate, is this back end of the pipeline, you have to have places for these individuals to go. If you have people coming into a system on the front end and you have no placement for them, the system is not going to function the way it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2199)|
| 0:36:59| So you constantly have to be putting energy and effort and allocating dollars towards the back end of your system to create the housing so that we can move people quickly off the street and into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2219)|
| 0:37:17| I'm going to take a moment to break down homeless population statistics and provide a little bit of the nuance of how these numbers are gathered. The major homeless statistic gathered across the country is through a method called point in time count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2237)|
| 0:37:37| And it is actually made up of two separate counts. It is a sheltered count, which includes both emergency shelter and transitional housing beds. And the number of individuals that are using those beds on a given night. So this is not just the number of individuals that are in emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2257)|
| 0:37:59| Please keep that in mind. And then the second count is our unsheltered count. And this is made up of individuals who are considered to be living in places not meant for habitation. And this is a definition placed by HUD. And so these two counts taken together make up your total homeless count for a given year. And this is the numbers that you will see in the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2279)|
| 0:38:25| Some background on the methodology for point in time counts. It has a sample time frame. Again, this is only one night. And it's one night usually in the middle of winter. It's usually conducted on the third or fourth week of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2305)|
| 0:38:43| And the idea behind that is that it's going to be the night when most individuals are going to seek shelter because of cold winter conditions. And the reason why that is, is because the shelter count is much more accurate than the unsheltered count to represent what a given city's homeless population would be or a given COC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2323)|
| 0:39:07| So again, it's one night. This is simply a snapshot of what's happening in a community over a given year. So the sheltered count, it is gathered through the homeless management information systems and a capacity report. And HMIS spends time to deduplicate individuals and make sure that we're not double counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2347)|
| 0:39:31| And then unsheltered count is done in our community specifically by an outreach team canvas. And this year it was a team of about 10 to 15 individuals who were outreach team members and individuals who were homeless service providers working directly on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2371)|
| 0:39:55| And these teams went out to specific geographic areas in Knoxville to encounter and do a brief survey of as many homeless individuals they could find that said that they did not go into shelter that evening. And that's, again, a measure to make sure we're not having a duplicated number and getting a more accurate understanding of what our homeless population was on that given night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2395)|
| 0:40:22| There's an issue, though, with gathering or unsheltered count, what I'd call data collection subjectivity, that there are different factors that come into play gathering this data. Weather can be a huge factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2422)|
| 0:40:37| It can either push people to access indoor areas if it's very cold outside, if it's raining. It can push people possibly into shelter that would actually be our unsheltered homeless population on a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2437)|
| 0:40:54| So there's a lot of different factors that go into why and how the unsheltered homeless count is gathered, and specifically being the number of individuals that are actually going out to count these unsheltered homeless on that day for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2454)|
| 0:41:12| And lastly, the survey tool that we use this year in particular, differentiated so that we can have our youth point in time count. So really, we have a point in time count that's for adults. And then we have a point in time count that targets homeless youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2472)|
| 0:41:29| And that's anyone up to age 24. And we are doing that to make sure that we're prepared for an upcoming grant that's called the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program that can bring a lot of funding towards trying to mitigate unaccompanied youth homelessness in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2489)|
| 0:41:47| Lastly, again, I just want to reiterate, there's population fluidity with our homeless population throughout a given year. So this number that is generated from a point in time count is not a constant number. The number ebbs and flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2507)|
| 0:42:03| And we have people that are hitting the street all the time. And a COC's function really is to mitigate homelessness in our community and make sure we can house and keep up with the inflow with the number of people that are hitting the street throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2523)|
| 0:42:18| So what you'll see now, this is from since 2011 of 2021, our point in time count numbers for Knoxville, Knox County. I will note that the 2021 results are preliminary, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2538)|
| 0:42:40| And the top green line, this is our total homeless population. So since 2011, we have seen a downward trend in that number fall by roughly 200 individuals since that time. However, since last year, we have seen an uptick with the preliminary numbers we have in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2560)|
| 0:43:02| But really, we're staying in line with kind of where we have been, you know, for about six years with our total homeless population. For our sheltered homeless population, we are seeing consistent downward trend, starting in, you know, 2011 with 849 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2582)|
| 0:43:31| Individuals in shelter down to where we are now with 550 individuals in our sheltered count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2611)|
| 0:43:41| And then lastly, what you can see with our unsheltered homeless count, there's a little bit of variability since 2011 to 2016. And then since 2016 to 2021, we've seen an increase in trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2621)|
| 0:43:56| But I want to pause for a moment there to talk about that trend and possible reasons why we are seeing that. And again, this goes to that data collection subjectivity I was talking about where from 2016 back to 2011, we only had a small group of individuals that were working towards collecting our unsheltered homeless count number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2636)|
| 0:44:20| This is one of our outreach teams for CAC that's been doing this work in Knoxville for over 25 years, I believe, as well as Officer Clinton, who was part of our KPD homeless unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2660)|
| 0:44:36| But since 2016 onward, we've had a significant increase in the number of outreach workers in our community to conduct this count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2676)|
| 0:44:47| In 2017 or 2018, City Council authorized two new outreach workers for VMC to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2687)|
| 0:44:56| And then recently, with COVID-19 dollars, City Council authorized four new street outreach workers to be brought on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2696)|
| 0:45:11| And so what we can see now is with the increased number of individuals that are doing our unsheltered count, we're accessing and reaching more individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2711)|
| 0:45:21| And so again, the thing I want you to take away when looking at point-in-time statistics is that the number is not an absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2721)|
| 0:45:30| It is the floor, not the ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| But when we're talking about trying to figure out what the ceiling is, truly in our community, we should really only do that in a way when we know there's methodological rigor behind how that number is captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2734)|
| 0:45:47| And so this is really us trying to do the best that we can in our community to understand where we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| I believe I saw a hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I remember a discussion during the roundtable meeting in January that talked about some of the difficulties during the pandemic of getting as many volunteers out to do that point-in-time count in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2761)|
| 0:46:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Was the pandemic a bit of a hindrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| So we decided not to use any volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| We did not want to bring households together and then send them out in vehicles to then go interact with our unsheltered homeless and then come all back together and then go back to their own households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2791)|
| 0:46:43| It did not — it just wasn't a good decision for our community at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| We were seeing a really sharp increase in COVID transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| So we made the decision not to send volunteers out to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| So that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Any other questions related to this with statistics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| I'll let Mike take over for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Oh, no, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| This one's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| So we're going to move on to our homelessness budget for the fiscal year 2020-2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| And first we have our community development block grants, the CDBG grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| And I have an asterisk next to this number or next to this column because I want to highlight that CDBG dollars are not solely allocated to homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2860)|
| 0:47:56| So all of CDBG dollars that have come into the community through either the CARES Act or just general year dollars that come in, they're not all allocated towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2876)|
| 0:48:07| So the numbers that you're going to see under this heading are the numbers that are allocated specifically to a homeless service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2887)|
| 0:48:19| So with regular year CDBG funds, we had 67,760.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| With the COVID round one for CDBG, $829,135 were allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| And with the third round of CDBG CB3, we have $190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| For emergency solution grants, which, again, as Becky stated in the beginning, these target specific homeless component categories such as street outreach, emergency shelter and services, rapid rehousing, data management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2920)|
| 0:48:55| And there's one more, and I'm sorry, it's leaving me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| But for these dollars, we have allocated $148,849 for ESG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| For ESG CB round one, we had $513,272.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| And then ESG CB round two, we've committed $956,140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2954)|
| 0:49:22| And we have a remainder of $1.2 million roughly of uncommitted dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| And then for our homeless general funds that are local dollars, we've had $186,000 come out for the homeless general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2969)|
| 0:49:39| We've had $180,000 come out for the office on homelessness general fund, which is noncompetitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2979)|
| 0:49:47| And then we've had a other special general fund of $100,000 come out of local dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2987)|
| 0:49:56| With a total budget of roughly $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| And the next thing I want to point out to everyone, just so you can see just the sheer volume of dollars that we're trying to manage right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3001)|
| 0:50:10| The outlined area are all COVID dollars that have come into the community that we're trying to get out as quickly as possible to specific programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3010)|
| 0:50:22| So it's roughly, you know, three times the amount that we normally get in a given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3022)|
| 0:50:31| Any questions related to budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| I don't know if others did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| I'm trying to better understand the ESG funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| And I know that the city requested an amendment to that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| And I don't know if that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| And I was wondering if you or Becky Wade could help us better understand the ESG funding and the amendment that the city submitted to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3056)|
| 0:51:10| I'll take a stab at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Ms. Parker, Linda Rust is on the call, too, and she may be able to help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| But our ESG, that $148,849, that's an annual allocation of funds that comes to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| That's generally all we get in ESG funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| So that's just general emergency solutions grants from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| The ESG CV round one, that 513-272, that's what was included in the amendment, substantial amendment that was added to our 19-20 annual action plan so that those funds could be allocated and spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3095)|
| 0:51:58| We have uncommitted ESG CV2 funds right now, but we also have applications that we're going through at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3118)|
| 0:52:07| And we'll have those funds committed within the next, within a month, I would say, for various programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3127)|
| 0:52:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| You've actually done two substantial amendments, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| And the substantial amendment is HUD verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| And because each of our grants has to fall within a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| And we were just finishing our consolidated plan, our five-year action plan this time last year when, of course, COVID hit and these funds became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3153)|
| 0:52:45| So rather than make us wait until we could get our consolidated plan and our first-year annual action plan done and turned in, they let us amend the year, the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3165)|
| 0:52:58| So that's what a substantial amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| We outline what we consider, what kind of change in our budgeting we consider a substantial amendment that we have to submit to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3181)|
| 0:53:12| We have that in our citizen participation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| But with that huge amount of money, every time we have to do a substantial amendment to accept it and then explain, and we try to do that as vaguely as possible to give ourselves some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3195)|
| 0:53:29| We spell out in the substantial amendment what component categories we want to spend it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| So we'll have to do another one for these new funds because they won't necessarily match what we did with the first round last October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3215)|
| 0:53:46| And then we have another one that we'll have to do also for our CDBGCV round three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| I hope that explains it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Well, and the reason I ask and part of my concerns are that we have such limited funding that supports those experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3236)|
| 0:54:08| And, you know, it seemed that that substantial amendment allowed us to expand who we could use the ASG grant on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3248)|
| 0:54:19| And it wasn't limited to, you know, a very narrow category of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3259)|
| 0:54:27| It seemed to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I was worried even during the roundtable discussion, I believe I heard that we had committed $200,000 as a city towards servicing those currently experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3269)|
| 0:54:44| I think it's important that we differentiate between the money that we have available and that we're planning to use towards the prevention and the money that we plan to use towards supporting those who are currently without housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3284)|
| 0:55:01| I will note that Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Go ahead, Linda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I was going to say not too far into the weeds, but the ESG CV funds still have to be used in the five component categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3308)|
| 0:55:17| And homelessness prevention is one of those component categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| There were certain waivers and flexibilities that were given to us with the CV fund, but they still had to address the basic five component categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3322)|
| 0:55:34| And I will also note that ESG dollars in general primarily have to be spent, besides for data management or HMIS, have to be spent for individuals who are literally homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3334)|
| 0:55:49| And so we actually struggle to spend these dollars when individuals don't meet that categorical definition by HUD of being literally homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3349)|
| 0:56:01| And that's kind of a safeguard really by HUD to make sure that the dollars going out for ESG are targeted to those who are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3361)|
| 0:56:14| But I do, just to clarify, the funding that we provided as a city to the Urban League for their rental assistance program, was that not ESG funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3374)|
| 0:56:24| It was originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| But because of the complexities of how we were able to do it, we were able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| Like Sean said, someone has to be on the verge of homelessness before they can access the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| And so to enable this process, to enable the Urban League to actually spend the money, we switched that out of ESG and turned it into ESG funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3402)|
| 0:56:54| So that's some of the money that you see is uncommitted on that line, because they weren't able to spend it as we hoped they would, since someone had to have an eviction letter in hand before you can use ESG money for their rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3414)|
| 0:57:12| It complicates the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| So that's why we reprogrammed some of this money back into uncommitted and we'll be spending most of that on literally homeless for rehousing activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3434)|
| 0:57:27| All right, Mike, I'll let you take this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| So these are allocations out of this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| And to do that, we're going to have to go back to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| We've got $401,495 going to street outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| And we're going to have to go back to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| And we're going to have to go back to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| And we're going to have to go back to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| And we're going to have to go back to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| And we're going to have to go back to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And I'll just run through them for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| We've got $401,495 going to street outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| $639,640 going to emergency shelter and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| $1.5 million to homelessness prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| $449,192 to rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| $375,893 to HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| And in this category, $129,500 operating costs for supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| And then we can take some administrative costs out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| It is important to note, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| if you'll tap that button there, Sean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| that $3.24 million of affordable rental development funds have been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| for the development of permanent supportive housing since 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| creating 108 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| So we're allocating this money across the spectrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| and trying to serve people where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| And we're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| We're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| We don't know exactly where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| but we do need, as we keep reiterating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| that funding at the end of the pipeline to create permanent housing so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| the other pieces of the pipeline can function to move people towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| Thank you, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| So this is the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| This is that federal grant program that we've talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| This is a process that I coordinate on behalf of the continuum of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| which is also are defined as our local homeless coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| They are the continuum of care body for Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| And so we've been working with our partners to apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| And then each agency that is designated as a recipient works with HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| directly to get the funds directly from HUD to each of those agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| So you see we've got a little bit, 104, 580 for street outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| That's actually for the CAC program that Sean mentioned that's been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| place for 20 some odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| And then we've got a little bit more for a joint transitional housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| permanent housing, rapid rehousing joint program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| Circled around a couple of times there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Essentially what that is is using transitional housing briefly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| individuals are placed into permanent housing as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| but having some transitional housing units in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| This is the Salvation Army in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| having transitional units in place to give some folks a place to be until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| they get that permanent housing placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| There is money, $952,060 in permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| which includes both operations for permanent supportive housing at Helen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Ross McNabb, MinnVilla, Flanagan Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| and at what is now becoming Casual Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| And in addition, rapid rehousing under HUD's categories is permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| because it's placing people into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| This is where a big piece of the funding for the homeless management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| information system comes from, $132,282.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| And so our continuum of care budget runs about $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| 4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| And for your reference, normally there is an application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| It took an act of Congress at the end of December in the budget that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| passed at the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| But they essentially just refunded everybody that had been funded through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| continuum of care in the previous year so that all of the folks that across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| the country that would normally have to scramble to pull together the rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| complex application would not have to do that in the middle of the COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3751)|
| 1:02:42| So in the past year, I think this is actually the anniversary of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| emergency declaration locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| I think I heard the mayor say that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| We have had a number of things that we've done in specific response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| The guest house was stood up fairly early in the pandemic last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| initially with city funds, general funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| to create non-congregate shelter in its first iteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| It was in the Metropolitan Drug Commission's building that they were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| using yet, right there on Fifth Avenue next to Moon Villa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| And the purpose of that facility is to provide a place for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| experiencing homelessness who either are awaiting a test result or who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| come up COVID positive and need a place with a separate room to the phone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3815)|
| 1:03:44| going to ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| But it's a place for people who need a separate place to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| socially distance while they're getting through their COVID or awaiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| their test results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| That has continued to be in place in its second iteration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| which was funded by Knox County in what was Positively Living and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| becoming Casual Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| The Positively Living building was used through the end of 2020 to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| that resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| And then starting at the beginning of this calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| it was moved into an underutilized Knox County Health Department building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| That resource continues to be in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| and except for right after the Christmas holidays when there was a spike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| everywhere, that facility has continued to have vacancy available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| I think the count this morning was one unit of 10 was being used this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| morning, and it's been that way for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| You'll hear more about that from the EMC in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| We have provided resources for emergency shelter and transitional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| alterations to make it safer for folks in those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| CARM and Salvation Army and others have worked with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| to make their facilities as safe as possible for folks who are in shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3911)|
| 1:05:21| Hotel and motel vouchers for families and unaccompanied homeless youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| So, again, a non-congregate shelter model has been used to serve those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| The Housing Assistance Program, this is the prevention program to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| people pay rent and utilities that is going to transition presently over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| Knox County with Treasury funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| And we have also put money towards street outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| the additional folks that Sean mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| and towards data management to make sure that we measure these activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| and understand the outcomes with Knox HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| Also, under COVID, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| it's created an additional layer of challenges for the unsheltered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| And with the unsheltered population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| we always have to balance the health and safety of the individuals who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| literally homeless with folks out in the general community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| And we have to respond in as humane a way as we can to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| to encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| But the pandemic added an additional layer of challenges to that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| The CDC gave us guidelines that suggested particularly early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| we responded this way of relaxing our activities to clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| camps as need arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| And as Sean has referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| and you'll hear more about shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| you have to balance the health and safety of folks and large encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| for not achieving what we needed for COVID safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| And the CDC guidance literally says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| in the context of COVID-19 spread and transmission risks associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| sleeping outdoors or in an encampment setting are different from staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| indoors in a congregate setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| such as the emergency shelter or other congregate facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| Outdoor settings may allow people to increase physical distance between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| themselves and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| adequate access to hygiene and sanitation facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| or connection to services and healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| unsheltered homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| And so we had to look at what is the best approach to addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| to working to help get people literally in bad situations off the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| and back into shelter and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| And so we have struggled to work through that process and we continue to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| But officer or Sergeant now Thomas Clinton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| I think is on the line to talk a little bit more about their piece of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| which is only a piece of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| And we'll go on to talk about more than we're doing to address that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Sergeant Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| I've made some notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| I don't have a fancy PowerPoint to go off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| So I'm going to try to do this without rambling too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| To start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| I want to kind of give you a history of what my role has been with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| And kind of how I got to this position that we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| Approximately six years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| I received a call about a mother looking for her daughter and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| and she didn't know where she was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| So I started trying to find her and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| and unfortunately it was unable to find her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| Which led me to start trying to keep some type of tracking on where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| were that weren't seeking shelter, which led to a database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| a lot of YouTube videos on how to work, work an Excel file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| And a lot of work on my part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| just trying to understand where the homeless were coming from going to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| why they weren't seeking services that were obviously in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| And doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| I have had many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| many conversations with the individuals that are living on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| and got to understand kind of the background on why a lot of people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| are out on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| And I know that Sean touched on it a little bit earlier with trauma and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| amount of historical stuff that just goes into becoming a homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| individual on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| In touching on that, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| we have to look at this in a compassionate way and I think that that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| that's been my goal from the get go because I don't think anybody chooses to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| be homeless. I don't think that that's a choice that somebody makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| I'd like to ask a question to everybody that I talked to that says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| when you were younger, what did you see yourself being in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And I haven't had anybody tell me that this is where I saw myself in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| future. So I don't think it is originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| or that anybody chooses to be homeless. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| I think choices lead up to homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| but I think that most people would tell you if they were honest with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| themselves that are on the street right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| that they would rather be somewhere else if they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| So that leads me to some of my points in dealing with our encampment issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| that we've had in the past. We've, we've obviously had, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| about in reality, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| three to four very large cleanups that we've had to deal with since I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| started this very early on underneath the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| when we had folks staying right there in the, in what is now the safe space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| Blackstock a couple of times, as well as the PSC site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| just up Blackstock on the old site there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| Those seem to be the hardest ones for us to, to deal with, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Because it affects the most people. It affects the most citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| It affects the most homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| And so it becomes a contentious point where it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| what is that balance and how does it look on who do we need to show the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| you know, where does our compassion lie? Does it lie with our citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Does it lie with our homeless and how do we balance it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Because I think it has to lie with both. And from the police point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| we have to play both sides of the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I have to satisfy what our citizens need and our business owners need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| especially in the downtown area and even across the city with what I see as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| beneficial outcome for our homeless. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| So in talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| let's start with some of the safety issues I see for our homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| when it comes to encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Many of the people I've talked to have given me the indication that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| in a constant state of fear while they're on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| They're scared for their safety. They're scared about their stuff being stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| They're scared about the access that predators can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| towards them on the street. Drug dealers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| other homeless individuals that obviously they don't have a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| so they steal from each other. It's not uncommon. Threats of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| We've had tent burnings. We've had crime, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| Another point of that comes from when we talk about our charitable donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| Everybody in this, we live in the Bible Belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| We have a lot of people that want to give to charity and they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| they want to donate a lot of items to our homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| What they don't see is a lot of times those charitable donations can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| someone that gets those on the front end, a target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| because now they have more than somebody else. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| It puts them in even a bad spot when it comes to the other people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| surrounding them, especially in large encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| The other part of that is that a lot of times they will use those donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| as payment because they don't have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| So they use those as payments for drugs or sex or a myriad of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| bartering tools to get what they want, which can cause some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| As far as safety is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| Another point is obviously the mental illness side of things and co-occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| disorders that we see on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| I've recently transitioned into the city's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| the police department's co-responder role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| So I have a behavioral health specialist that rides with me every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| And we go out and see people that are in mental health crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| A lot of our folks on the street are dealing with serious mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| And there's a lot of times we don't have a good, good answer for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| And so I think where it boils down to is how do we deal with mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| And so I think where it boils down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| as far as safety is concerned is most individuals want to be able to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| soundly at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| knowing that they are not going to be messed with because you have to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| with one eye open because you can't predict what's going to go on when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| out of, out of a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| So that's my points on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Environmentally, we have to look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| When we talk about sites like the PSC site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| that was at the time we first cleaned it up, a complete brownfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| meaning toxic location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| And people are living there, they're digging up old metal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| which can lead to disease, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| which led to one of the folks that was living there almost losing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| losing his arm to gangrene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| which was a huge safety issue when we talk about areas like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| Secondly, when we start talking about the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| we have to look at where are people going to the bathroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| Where are they taking baths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| What are they doing for the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| For their own personal hygiene situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| And that means that they're sometimes going into our creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Toxic waste is going into our creeks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| So they're bathing in areas that we have signs posted downstream that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| we recommend people not go into our streams because of the amount of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| that was coming down from places like PSC into that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| But we have people bathing in that same stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| which is a safety issue for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| You also have to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| where the human waste that's going into that streams when they utilize those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| And that goes directly into our main waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| So that affects not only the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| it also affects every other citizen of this town that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| that uses our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| our rivers and creeks to do their outdoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| You know, it's, it's not just affecting one group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| Lastly, on environmental issues, the cost of cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| I don't know what our dollar figure is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| but I think it's about $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| I'm sure that that cost gets exorbitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| It's not just a public service cleanup anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| So it's costing the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| the citizens of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| a lot of tax dollars to clean up what we're having to deal with regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Well, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| The ones I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| and I talked about this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I think what I've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| what I've heard on the street from a couple of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| I think it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4573)|

| 1:16:18| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4585)|

| 1:16:27| it's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| It's a little bit of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| I know for some people that I've talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| and I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| I've built a lot of good relationships over the last six years with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| with our homeless population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| to the point where I feel like a large portion of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| the people that are living on the streets have a trust built with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| To feel like they can come to me with problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| but I don't feel like they have that with every officer and that's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| That's a failure on our portion to do our outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| that we would love to do and get our FaceTime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| with these individuals and actually talking to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| because it did fall upon myself for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| And now Officer Moret is helping out with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| But we're having to distance ourself from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| because we don't have time right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| because of the amount of camps that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| building in this city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| COVID really put a damper on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| because we had to stop our regularly scheduled cleanups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| for such a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| that now we're playing catch up on a lot of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| And I want everybody to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| we aren't seeking out camps to clean up, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| The camps that we clean come from complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| from our citizens that call in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| I'm seeing this, I'm seeing people in the woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| I'm seeing people in my front of steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I'm seeing people about business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| people are panhandling in front of my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| It's all coming from complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| I'm not actively seeking out people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| to take their stuff and throw it away, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| That's not our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| That's never been my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| So that's some of the issues we're dealing with there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| We want to build that trust up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| and I'll get back to what I was talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| We want to build that trust up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| between the police and the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| for them to feel safe and secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| that they can come to us with their problems, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Because we have a lack of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| that will willingly come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| especially in large encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| because they're fearful of their safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| if they talk to the police about a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| They're fearful of what might happen to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| by their own peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| That's a real issue that we have a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| and I have a feeling that there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| in the last encampment we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| we had a serial rapist down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| that had raped seven women and one male,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| had burned tents, was causing havoc down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| that that would have never come to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| had we not had some type of a rapport built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| with the community, from the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| from myself, from Officer Moret,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| from our public service crew that goes out every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| They see us, they know us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| they feel comfortable coming to us and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| I've got a problem and I would love for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| to try to help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| That doesn't happen all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| and that's a real issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| and one of the reasons I strongly oppose large encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| It's also an issue for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| because they have a lack of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| it's kind of a peer pressure issue, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| where they see other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| if I wanna go and I wanna do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| I might get peer pressure from other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| to seek out work or try to get off the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| or not do drugs today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| because of the amount of folks that are around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| in a large encampment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| If we can get those spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| to where they're all smaller encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| it will tend to lead to less violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| because they're in a group that they trust more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| and it allows them to focus on their own needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| versus the wants and feels of everybody around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| because they're scared of their own safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| I understand, and I think it would be naive for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| to say that everybody that I talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| should get into a program and go to shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Not everybody's gonna do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| I think that the city as a whole understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| I think if we don't at least make that attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| to get them to go to services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| then we are failing as a city to try to address the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| So by us doing these cleanups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| by us trying to minimize the large encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| it gives us more contact, more private contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| a better ability for them to build trust in who we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| because we're able to talk to them a lot easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| if they're not in a big group of 40 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| I think the goal of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| is to satisfy both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| and we have to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| It's a very, very delicate balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| For the homeless side of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| we have to refer to services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| which we do on every account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| That's our main goal is to refer to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| We are not an arrest first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| We don't have that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| We don't go out to take people to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| It's just not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| We want to refer them to services for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| for medical, for transportation, for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| And that's what our service providers can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| For the citizens of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| which we also have to take into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| we have to take care of their businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| because they worked hard for that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| We have to take care of their safety concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| for who's around their homes and their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| We have to take care of them wanting to also be charitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| and how they can give intelligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| I think that that's something also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| that the citizens have to be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| because we've got a lot of people that want to help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| But there's a lack of education there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| on how they can truly give back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| And I'm sorry I rambled a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| because I get off topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| This is my first time in front of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| So what I want to end with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| is that we need to really focus on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| I can refer people all day long to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| I can refer people to services all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Two services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| But if they're going to go to services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| and they're going to be let go out of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| they're going to be back on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| because we have nowhere as an end game to put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| When I look at our dollar amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| and I see that it's a higher dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| for emergency shelter than it is for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| I feel like that's a problem from my point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| And I'm not the financial guru that Mike is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| and how the funds work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| I'm a lowly police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| But I really feel that it is a necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| that we could make a real difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| if I could go to a camp and I could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| you can't stay here, but I've got a place for you to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| and we can get you in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| That would be the benefit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| And I think everybody's looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| However, we want to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| If we think that the tents are the way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| if we think that giving people stuff is the way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| which I don't agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| but I think we all have the same objective in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| which is we want to help people be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| and get off the street permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Because I don't feel like homeless should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| homelessness should be a place in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| not your life's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| It should be a stopping point, not the end point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| We got here for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| but how can we finish it by getting out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| And if we continuously maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| that we'd want to keep them on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| there's no reason for them to get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| If we make it so easy that they can stay on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| with all the comforts of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| we've given them no incentive to get off, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| And I agree wholeheartedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| that this is not a city of Knoxville issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| This goes way back to the welfare system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| This goes way back before any of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| were in the office that we hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| We have put ourselves in a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| where we want to help people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| but we over help on a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| to the point where it makes it very easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| to not want to move, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| I think I saw there was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Sorry, Councilwoman Parker, you can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| If Sergeant Clinton was wrapping up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| you're welcome to finish and I can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Just last couple of points, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| and I'm sorry if I'm taking too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| I feel like we've got to get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| I utilize camp cleanups as a contact point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| I utilized it as a time for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| to talk to people again about services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| I use this as a motivation to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| this is not where you need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| This is not where you want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| if you think about it long and hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| You need to get into services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| We need to talk to somebody and you haven't talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| I have these discussions all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| Who'd you talk to today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5094)|
| 1:24:54| What are you trying to achieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| As long as they're working towards housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| I'm willing to bend backwards to help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| Like I said, I'm not here to arrest them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| I'm here to help them get off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| Officer Morant being the same mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| and having the backing of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| as a whole on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| Our goal is to find permanent solutions for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| And however, if they want to be mad at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| because I moved them again, they can get mad at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| They can get mad at me over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| but if it changes their outlook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| on what they need to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| and it gets them into housing, I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| I will give them as much time as they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I've been told that I give them too much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| to get their things together before we move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| I've been too lenient on people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| but I'm okay with taking that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| if it helps somebody get off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| And a lot of these problems are not quick solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| We've had, if you talk to the CAC out workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| who've been doing this for much, much longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| than I ever did, they will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| they've been working with people for 15, 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| before they finally made that choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| because we can show them all the benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| that we've got in this town, which are immense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| but they got to make the choice finally on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| to do it because you got to want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| before you can get off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| I just want to be a stopping point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| for them to say, I can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| How can I do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Maybe Officer Clinton can help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Maybe he can get me a ticket home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Maybe he can get me into somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Maybe he knows somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| I'm totally fine being that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| And I guess I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I will take questions if you have some for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| and I apologize if I got too far off topic on offshoots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you, Sergeant Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| I initially raised my hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| because I had questions about the city's interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| of the CDC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| I've read that same section that you're referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| but my reading of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| and also from other advocates and lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| that I've reached out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| is that the CDC kind of outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| how to balance those risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Below that paragraph that you read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| if you keep reading down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| they give suggestions of what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| but they are primarily focused on non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| or how to provide support to the encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| so that it can be a more safe place during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Was that not the city's understanding about those guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| It's balancing all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| We work to try to provide support to encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| particularly at Blackstock earlier in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| And we, as you'll hear later in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| are looking at our options for non-congregate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| noting that we're already doing non-congregate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| both with the guest house and with resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| that CAC is providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| and Misty Goodwin can talk about that in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| But it's a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| And the feedback that we were getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| from not just Sergeant Clinton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| but from the street outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| was that we were not striking the balance that we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| We were not achieving the goals of protecting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| from transmission of COVID by social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| And we were creating circumstances that were not safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| for the individuals in those encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| And so none of this is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| None of us are trying to be cruel to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| We're trying to find the best path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| with the resources that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| and with the resources that we can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| So we're continuing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| And our read the whole time through has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| how can we do our best to balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| the health and safety of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| not only because of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| but because of general circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| that they're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| Now, when the policy was in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| to not break up encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| and you saw Blackstock growing larger than you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| was there an attempt by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| to find other places where folks could camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| to be able to have smaller encampments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| Or was that the responsibility of the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| to figure out where to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| We weren't looking for other places to create encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| If people chose to move to other encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| they were doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| I'd say, Mike, at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| I'm pretty sure that we had given enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| for our service providers like CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| to have their stuff in place by that moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| before we started the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| They had new protocols in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| and socially distanced beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| and all of those things ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| That led to some of that decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| We've been very fortunate as far as COVID is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| that we have not had major spikes in the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| And we have had shelters able to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| that have additional capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| even though they reduced their overall beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| in order to socially distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| they have additional capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| So at some point, the shelter becomes a more viable option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| for someone to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| And while the encampments were in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| how did the city determine what would be adequate support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| for those encampments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| How many porta-potties they would need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| How much trash collection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Where folks could put their trash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| What was the planning like for that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| We work with the public service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| to identify resources for the porta-potties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| and with outreach workers to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| what we thought would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| and put those resources out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| and try to make them available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| They were used some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| We tried to have the outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| actually do some cajoling and incentivizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| to get folks to use those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| But in many cases, they were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| but not being really used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| So it was an ongoing effort to try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| what we could put in place and see how it worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| and what else we could do as we work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| And do you know, last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| how many porta-potties the city put out throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| for those without housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| I don't have that in front of me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| And you don't know when the porta-potties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| were put out either, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| I would have to look that up and get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I'm just curious about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| because we need to kind of paint a picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| of where there have been some gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| And we've had concerns from community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| about individuals not able to access restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| And so we've seen folks having to relieve themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5564)|
| 1:32:52| throughout the city in inappropriate places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| I was wondering, I imagine things will begin opening up soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| as COVID numbers go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| but this continues to be an issue for homeless folk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| access to adequate restrooms and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| What is the current plan for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| Well, we currently have porta-potties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| that are consistently placed in the safe space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| that individuals can use during those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| So just to kind of backtrack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| there's at least two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| and then there's also indoor facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| attached to the safe space that are consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| You were likely referring to what was placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| adjacent to encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| but I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5623)|
| 1:33:52| Okay, well, that answers a few of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| I would love a follow-up email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| if you all could share that with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| of the porta-potty situation during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| And Sergeant Clinton, I had a quick question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| And I appreciate you sharing a bit of the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| of how you came to this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| It's really helpful to get that background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| And one thing I was curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| is I've been relying on various studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5663)|
| 1:34:32| that have come out about how to end homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| And I've been going through the different studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| and there's different recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| but for the most part, evidence-based studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| that are based on lots of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| And there's one thing that you pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| is that the trust and relationship building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| is very important part of being able to connect folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| with the proper services, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| In your experience or in the studies that you've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| do you have a sense of the time that it takes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| The reason I asked this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| let me ask it in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| I understand that you have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| that if we provide too much support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| that we're only enabling homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| to continue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| But I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| that we are kind of basing our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| and our practices on some kind of tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| and true evidence-based research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| So I just wanted to give you an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| If your position regarding what our policy should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| regarding the homeless is based on some sort of research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| I'd love if you could share that with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| or best practices or whatever, wherever it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| I will say that a majority of my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| are from the folks that I'm talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| Now, I will say that I have looked into some options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| for assisting people in getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| some type of rapid rehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| I have proposed, made a proposal to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| that we are still working through some of the kinks on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| about a rapid rehousing location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| that we can try to get people in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| similar to what I've stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| where I would love to be able to tell people to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| we've got a location that you could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| and lock your stuff away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| and you don't have to be scared tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| But that's based off of a lot of different factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| that have to come into play as far as funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| because it is a big project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| and where it's gonna be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| We have to find that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| What I have to look at is what I'm being told on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| by the individuals that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| When we have the large encampment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| and this may be different than what you heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| the folks that I talked to were telling me that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| and this is several of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| they didn't want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| They didn't want to make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| They didn't wanna have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| They would love to be inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| but they may have been either removed from CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| and they had not talked to the foyer, which was an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| And so we have to look at other options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| Like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| I'm not opposed to allowing someone to take their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| but I have to look at what I'm dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| on the homeless side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| And I also have to take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| what citizens of Knoxville are telling me as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| because when a complaint comes in, I have to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| I can't just let it go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| So I can't just say, well, they're homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| They don't have anywhere to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| but I'll have a discussion with that business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| or that landowner that these individuals are on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| which they have a stake to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| and they've put forth their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| and their time and effort into owning to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| I would like to work with these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| to try to get them off your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| but I would like to do it in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| that's not going to be taking them to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| because if we take them to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| that's one more barrier that they have to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| And so it's a communication thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| I think it's already been documented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| that Housing First is a model that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| because it allows people to focus on their needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| versus their insecurities with being on the street, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| If you take away the hindrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| of having to watch over your shoulder every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| because you don't know what's coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| or who wants to take your stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| or who wants to do whatever to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| and you can be in a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| where you can lock the doors behind you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| or you can be in a shelter that is safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| and you can focus on your mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| through alcohol or drug addictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| your lack of employment or your lack of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| or your need for further education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| it's shown in study after study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| that Housing First is a model that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| And I think that's all I've ever tried to push for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| And I know that in my discussions with Mike and Sean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| and American Canon and everyone that I've ever spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| over the last six years on this has been to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| we've got to find a way to get people into housing quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| because I can preach, I can ask, I can beg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| I can do whatever I do out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| but if they don't have an end game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| it leads back to a hopelessness state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| where they think this is the best it's ever gonna be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| And when we perpetuate that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Go ahead, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I was just, let me use that as a segue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| One, you hit on the best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| that we're certainly focused on is Housing First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| and permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| That's been shown nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| as one of the most effective things to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| particularly for the chronically homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| really challenged population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| that we're primarily talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| And it's probably the most humane thing that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| And it's also been shown locally and nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| as the most cost-effective way to serve folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| It's helping people get as quickly as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| off the street into permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| that provides them the stability that they can then use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| to address their other underlying issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| I did receive a quick message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| from the public service director, Mr. West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| that the portable toilet at Blackstock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| was placed there early in the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| and was there throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| until when that camp was cleaned up in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| So we had facilities put out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| in addition to the ones that Sean mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| to the safe space and the public plumbed restroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| at the side of the foyer right next to the safe space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| Hey, Mike, just to add into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| because I know this was an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| that we were also concerned about early in the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| we sent out an email to council in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| about all the restroom space that was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| I'd be happy to share that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| if that's helpful history for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| I think Councilman Ryder has questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| And just to wrap up my comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| I just wanted to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| that I feel like we're in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| but there is a disconnect happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| You know, like you said, Sergeant Clinton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| you wanna be able to tell folks where they can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| but you don't have anywhere to tell them where they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| But on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| you feel the need to clear the encampment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| so they don't get too comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| and they do seek shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| but then there's no shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| So we gotta deal with that middle road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| Yeah, and I will say in coming slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| we're gonna talk about that disconnect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| and possible ways to address this and find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| So in coming slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| we'll definitely try and hone in on that Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| And then I just wanted to also note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| I think your question had to do with time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| and evidence-based and getting people off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| Unfortunately, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| going back to the complexity of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| each individual that is homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| has a myriad of different issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| that they are facing to overcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| not being on the street anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| and also maintaining the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| if we get them into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| So even highly efficient homeless service systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| like the one I studied in Houston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| that are pushing people into permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| or rapid rehousing very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| they still have folks that are falling back to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| and they're still trying to help get those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| and get them engaged to want to maintain their housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| or even stay in the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| And that goes back to the community and culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| and social bonds that are created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| because individuals who are unsheltered homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| like the people that are still on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| or their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| and that's where they go for support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| And we see that in our Broadway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| where folks who are housed still go back to that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| to spend time with those individuals in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| because that is their community now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| and that is their support group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Sorry, Councilwoman Ryder, you can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| No, that was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| I appreciate the extra information and details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| I would like to ask a couple of questions real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| about the point in time statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| And so maybe you are getting to some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| that you just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| So if you look at that slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| at one point in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| so this is a 10 year span we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| you show 849 in shelter and then 721, 850, 780,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| and then a steady decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| Did we, how many shelter beds do we have now total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| And did we at some point have that many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Because I'm not aware that we have that many, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| I believe with our COVID restrictions in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| that our emergency shelter beds are hovering around 360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| They're usually higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Each emergency shelter has had to reduce capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| So I think those numbers are actually closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| to 400, 400 plus emergency shelter beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| However, if we're going back 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| we did not have the foyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| And so the foyer added an additional 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| emergency shelter beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| And I'm also not, I don't have a solid answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| to whether we had some of our other emergency shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| in place, such as, I do believe Salvation Army's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| domestic violence shelter was in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| but there's also Family Promise runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| an emergency shelter program for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| And then Helen Ramsey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| program for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| And then Helen Ross McNabb also runs a host home program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| for homeless youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| And unfortunately, I don't have the timeline for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| on when those programs were established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| to give you an accurate number across time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| of what our emergency shelter beds were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| But if I had to give you an estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| it's somewhere around 360 would be a good number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| to be at throughout that time span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| So-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| And I'd like to just quickly note that that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| on that chart also includes transitional housing beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Which includes things like the YWCA or transitional beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| at the Salvation Army and some other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| And so that number bumps up into 500, 525,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| I believe is something around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| Okay, but let's not even talk about COVID 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| If we look at 2018, 2019, 2020 on this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| it's 557, 605, 549.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| The number is pretty consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| So if you say 2018 versus 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| you're looking at 849 versus 557.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| So did the number of beds or in emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6380)|
| 1:46:27| plus transitional decrease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| or they're just that many people not going to the shelter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| That's what I'm trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| from the fluctuation of the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| And I'm not even gonna look at 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| I'm gonna look at 2018, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| Does that make sense what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Yeah, I understand what you are asking, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| And that it's a hard inference to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| on what is driving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| I would say that we have consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| actually been adding beds to our system over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| and not decreasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| I mean, transitional housing would be the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| that is shifting, whereas emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| relatively should have been staying somewhat consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| over that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| CARM, and CARM can maybe speak to this a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| when they're on, but their capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| has remained fairly consistent through time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| except when they add auxiliary programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| such as the Paraya and other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| Mike, do you have any thoughts on that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| I'm trying to pull up our emergency shelter numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| over several of those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| and they stay fairly consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| in the emergency shelter category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| stays fairly consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| and around 400, a little north of 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| So is the transitional housing number fluctuating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| Well, I'm trying to pull these things up as we're speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6493)|
| 1:48:23| I was gonna say, I mean, if we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| in the essence of time, we can go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| and we can come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I'm happy to get an answer later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| It may be actually a good time to take a short break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| We've been at this for almost two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| So Vice Mayor McKenzie, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| if this would be an appropriate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| to just take a short break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| let everybody stretch their legs a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| That's fine, the council would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| we can take a 10 minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| and come back at, let's come back about three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| till six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Ms. McKenzie, can I say something real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| Okay, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| I'm leaving town this evening to go to Johnson City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6544)|

| 1:49:08| If anyone has a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| I'll be glad to meet with anybody individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6550)|

| 1:49:24| So if anybody has any questions for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6564)|

| 1:49:31| can get back to me with anything that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| And I apologize for running out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6574)|

| 1:49:46| you have something before you leave town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| I was just saying thank you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Okay, with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6595)|
| 1:49:55| let's reconvene at six o'clock sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| We'll take a 10 minute break, 11 minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| All right, Council, it is six o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| We're gonna resume the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| and I will turn it back over to Deputy Chief Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| to let us know who will be presenting next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Thanks, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Welcome back, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| I'm actually gonna turn it back over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| to Mr. Dunthorne and Mr. Griffith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| I asked Will to send you, Council Members, some documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| So you all should now have the 2011 housing inventory count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| the 2018 housing inventory count, the 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| I'll pull those up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| Hopefully I have the 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| I'm not gonna go through everything that's on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| just to hone in on, this was the wrong one, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6655)|
| 1:51:04| Apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Okay, sorry, mine were in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| All right, not gonna go through everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| on this housing inventory count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| but just to get at your question, Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| right here on this top line says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| emergency safe haven transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| You have total year round beds right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| And that number for 2011 is 876.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| And 402 of those were emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| and 447 were transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| And what has happened over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| and I'll pull up 2018 now is, sorry, give me just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6703)|
| 1:51:58| is that we have had a decrease in the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6718)|
| 1:52:08| in transitional housing beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| And apparently for 2018, we also had a slight decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| in the number of emergency shelter beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| So that number, that year round number dropped to 643 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| And then if you go, I just pulled 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| just for everyone to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| Okay, I have it up, apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6752)|
| 1:52:43| All right, too many things open now on my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6763)|
| 1:52:51| And then 695 total beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| You see the increase with the foyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| for 443 emergency shelter beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| And then 252 transitional housing beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| And then the one thing again to note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| again, for during COVID is that we had a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| in the number of available emergency shelter beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| due to COVID precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| But throughout the entire pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| we have had available shelter space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| in capacity throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| And roughly, and a person HMIS may show this to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| when we go over the HMIS dashboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| but emergency shelter capacity is averaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| somewhere in between 60 and 70% through the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6818)|
| 1:53:46| So to that question, when the point in time count happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| okay, and it shows 500, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| so let's talk about the 2021 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| It shows 900, I'm sorry, I can't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| it's too far away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| 550 sheltered homeless at the point in time count for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| And this is the bed count at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| And that sheltered includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| So it'd be 2020, so you'd need to look at the 2020 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| Okay, so the 2020 number is 549.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| It's only one different in sheltered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| So there's 549 people in sheltered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| marked as sheltered homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| And how many beds were there at that point in time night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| for that year, 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| Because what's being counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| 695 for 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Okay, so you have ballpark 150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| but a little shy of 150 empty beds is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| And that's available after COVID spacing precautions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| Yeah, so this was before COVID, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| So these would have been before COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| Okay, okay, so we don't have a 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| We don't have the housing inventory count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| The COC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Yeah, we haven't produced that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| And the 2021 numbers are preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| We just wanted to have them for y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| to have kind of a working point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| to understand where we think we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| Okay, and the permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| the 749 further down the column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| So that's including permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| rapid rehousing and other permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| What's the vacancy rates on those run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| Are there any, or is it always full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| So permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| tends to run close to full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| Rapid rehousing almost definitionally is at 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| because they're simply finding people units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| in scattered sites and placing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| And so it becomes a rapid rehousing unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| when somebody is placed in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| Yeah, so that number only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| the only numbers we get for rapid rehousing in a given year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| is if an individual signs a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| So it's not by number of units that are necessarily vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| It's just the number of leases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| that are signed in a given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| And then our permanent supportive housing capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| which we'll get at again later is hovering at about 96%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6989)|
| 1:56:38| Okay, so going back to the point in time statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| there were 500 for 2020, which was done pre COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| there were 549 people in shelter at the emergency shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| or transitional housing, but a total of 695 beds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Just wanna make sure I understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| and I'm reading correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| And the count for the point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| which is the biggest room margin for error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| is counting people out in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| you know, outside of the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| The count there was 196 that did not take shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Okay, and then one other question I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| about the point in time statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| you said you guys do this traditionally in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| to try and get it at a time when it's coldest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| so that most people are in shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| to get the most accurate reflection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| Do you guys include in the count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| the temperature and the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| Sometimes in January, we have crazy freak warm weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| I can go back and pull all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| They have, NOAA has all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| that information that we could pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| I don't know if we necessarily document that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| but it's information that I could easily gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| Yeah, we can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| It's the point in time count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| This is again, a HUD requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| And so they require it to be done during the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7084)|
| 1:58:10| in January because of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| everything else going on this year in COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| we and a lot of other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| received a little leeway and waivers from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| So I think our 2020 numbers were mid-February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| Okay, thank you for explaining further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7113)|
| 1:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| Let's move to the next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Yes, Council, Council Member, oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| Yeah, Mr. Dunthorne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| looking at the chart you just showed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| it looked like back in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| we had 645 beds for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| And then in the 2020 numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| it looks like it went up to 749.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| But that was the point of time in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| Since then, don't we have some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| permanent supportive housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| that are gonna come online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| that haven't come online yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| So probably the biggest one of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| and you'll hear about it shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| is Casual Manor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| which CAC is building on 5th Avenue near Casual Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| And then, that's really the biggest one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| the biggest, somebody help me here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| if I'm forgetting something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| I think KCDC has some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| There's another one under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Sorry, it's out at Mineral Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Helen Ross McNabb Center's building 50 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| for seniors' permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| So that's under construction as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| And Casual Manor is due to start construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| in the end of April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| after they close on their tax credit financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| And Director Wade, how many units is Casual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| So we're seeing an increase over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| in the number of permanent supportive housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| based on that comparison that we're looking at right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| Would that be fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| It is an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| It's slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| And sometimes these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| take a very long time to get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| So I think the point we're making tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| is the more the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| And very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| Mike, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| I can add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| We will have 212 project-based voucher units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| across two, three, four, five different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| Each of those are in what we call AHAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| So the application for housing assistance payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| has an effective date across there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| So we're looking at, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| adding 212 units dedicated to project-based housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| Thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| And just, we haven't had a chance to introduce him yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| because he's coming up on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| That's Matt McGrath-Tiller with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| Councilman Smith, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| I have a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| These numbers do not include workforce housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| or general term affordable housing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| Just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| Yeah, these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| Two or three other questions I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| Shawn and Michael, I met with y'all in CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| a couple of weeks ago to discuss the outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| that's done in South Maxwell particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| We talked a lot about, for a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| literally homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| And I think maybe Ms. Rust mentioned that a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| Can you describe what that is as a federal requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| and what the implications are of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| So literally homeless by HUD's terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| includes people who are unsheltered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| living in a place not meant for human habitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| or living in emergency shelter or in transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| It does not include people who are doubled up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| staying on somebody's couch or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| There are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| Well, the important part of that last point you made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| is that if somebody is staying with a friend on a couch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| talk about the implications of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| as it relates to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| then getting in federally funded housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| Yeah, so I think what the implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| that you're talking about Councilman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| have to do with the chronic homeless designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| And essentially what happens is HUD has its own definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| for what chronically homeless is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| and to give it a very rough definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| it's an individual who is either consistently on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| for 12 straight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| or an individual who has had episodic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| for across four periods of homelessness episodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| that then add up to 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| And that has to be documented by a service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| for that individual to then be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| to get the chronic homelessness designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| to then access the specific type of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| that is available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| And our two facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| that target chronic homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| are Menvilla and Flinnegan Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| and they make up a large portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| of our coordinated entry stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| There are also permanent supportive housing beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| by Helen Ross, sorry, the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| Those beds to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| and I can be corrected if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| they do not have to have the chronic homeless designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| but they have other different niches that they're filling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| So it could be, this is veteran, permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| or this is for individuals who have a certain disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| or elderly, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| So does that help answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| Yeah, just to add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| I know one of the biggest challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| I've volunteered care for, loved on the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| my entire life and I know a lot of them personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| And so some of the challenges that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| is some of these folks may have a friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| that they can stay with for a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| or some of them save up enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| at the first of the month where they stay at a hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| for a couple of weeks and then their money runs out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| and then they're back on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| And so a lot of folks might not be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| that the implication of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| that there are federal requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| for that chronically homeless designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| that prevents someone who has temporary shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| for a little bit with a friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| that then delays their ability to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| that federal program for permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| And so a lot of folks skipping in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| of temporary housing and by doing that itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| delays their access to long-term housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| So it's not an easy solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| but it is something that I think a lot of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| may not be aware of and it is quite the gap to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7552)|
| 2:05:59| And I just had two more questions, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| Before we go on to our next partners, page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| Talk about Sean and Michael, maybe what this may look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| for other metros over the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7570)|
| 2:06:15| Meaning-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| Is slide 12 the time statistics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| Yeah, so ours is headed downward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| understanding the point in time disclaimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| What does that look like for other metros our size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| It is, it's across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| Each city is unique and so it would be hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7592)|
| 2:06:39| And each city has a different continuum of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| that's trying different strategies out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| I could pull a couple of different ones comparatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| The ones I have readily available right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| are comparisons to larger metropolitan areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| such as Houston, Texas and Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| So they're not real good comparisons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| to give you just-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| I'd be curious about our peer cities in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| Chattanooga, Nashville, Memphis particularly would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Yeah, I can pull that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| And then the last question I had, maybe two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| One is related to the guest house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| How many people have been served to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| in the guest house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| I do not have a good answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Hold on, I can maybe pull that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| 124.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| Or Gabe can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Thank you, Ms. Klein, all right, 124.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Again, that was the temporary emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| that was created for those experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| who have tested positive for COVID or potentially have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| And then the last question I have for Ms. Russ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| Linda, earlier we talked about homelessness prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| and the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| how funding is used for homelessness prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| Can you describe the types of homelessness prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| services that apply to that criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| Sure, so the purpose of homelessness prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| that's the one population that does not need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| to be literally homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| These are people who are at risk for homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| They could be fleeing domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| And the type of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| I mean, it's intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| homelessness prevention is intended to provide relocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| and stabilization services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| or short and or medium term rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| So it's really homelessness prevention is what it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| is to prevent the family from having to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| literally homeless or go to a shelter or the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| Council Member Ryder, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| No, I think I forgot to lower my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| All right, we are gonna move on to the partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| and providers discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| And first up, we have Nate first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| He's with the Homelessness Management Information Systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| which is housed in Swarps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| All right, well, thank you, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| And of course, thank you, Mayor McCannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| and council members for giving us a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| to share as a homeless services community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| kind of what is dear to our heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| So I've been tasked with trying to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| a little bit about our dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| and then also more kind of on a broad scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| some notes about our data in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| who we serve, who our providers serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| who is in HMIS, and really how best to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| and use the data so that we can make smart decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| with our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| So that's my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Next little bit, I'll dip my toe into irony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| a little bit here that I'll be a sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| homelessness data nerd that won't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| touch on the numbers very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| just so I can kind of keep that macro view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| on things a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| So again, what is HMIS data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| Where can we find it and how can we use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| I'm gonna share our dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| and then I'm gonna ask you to do kind of the impossible here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| which is how can we use HMIS data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| which is not to do what I'd be tempted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| which would be immediately be to nod my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| in an interested fashion and continue to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| while I completely turned out the current speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| and probably the next couple of speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| as I dug into the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| It's very tempting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| And so we'll go on trust here on that foundation of trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7890)|
| 2:11:36| foundation of trust that we have laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| that we'll stay present for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| I really do hope that you'll take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| Are you seeing the dashboard now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| Is that what's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7913)|
| 2:11:53| Okay, thank you, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| So a few things I really wanna share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| and this will also kind of be a platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| about our data more broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| And so the first thing which everybody around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| basically knows also kind of hopefully send all of us out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| as a commission to others when they might be tempted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| to misinterpret some of our data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| is that this is quarterly data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| This is a quarterly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| And so when you see these numbers like over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| clients served 3,900 in the third quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| A temptation for some in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| is gonna be to look at this at a quick glance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| and say, goodness gracious, there were 3,900 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| literally homeless on any given day in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| And some folks are actually gonna interpret this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| to think that there are 3,900 people on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| when they hear the word literal homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| It can be an assumption folks can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| that the HUD definition of literal homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| is the folks that we see or think we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| on a daily basis when we're driving by certain communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| And so I wanted to highlight first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| really first that the data that we're collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| on the dashboard is sort of aggregated data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| across 90 days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| And so similar to what Councilperson Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| had brought up where folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| they flux and flow in and out of homelessness often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| And one number I will throw at you is that last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| the average amount of time that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| was in emergency shelter over the course of the whole year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| was 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| And if you include emergency shelter, transitional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| and then perhaps some rapid rehousing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| up until someone is housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| then that length can grow to something shy of three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| which is a little more than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| But it's still a small enough amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| that there's quite a bit of churn with our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| And so this 3,900 is including those that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| as you might expect, unsheltered in emergency shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| in transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| It's also including those that Suresh brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| those receiving homeless prevention services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| So those that are at imminent risk of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| following some fairly strict HUD guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| on who qualifies as at imminent risk of becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| And so it includes services to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| And then it also includes those that are often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| that are housed on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| that are in permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| And some folks are in permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| And we're gonna continue to track those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| in our homeless management information system too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| because this is absolutely one of the most important ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| that our data is able to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| that our community is trying to address homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| from all these different angles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| that we've talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| And then just to highlight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| we've already pretty much touched on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| but again, literal homelessness, as Mike had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| that's those that are, yes, on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| but also those in emergency shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| and transitional housing are included in those counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8139)|
| 2:15:46| So I'll do away with my little fancy widget here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| and show you a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| So getting access to the data is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8154)|
| 2:16:00| What I'd say, I'll share the link for the dashboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| but really just if you Google, if anybody here hasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| if you just Google homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| homelessness dashboard of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| any combination of such words and you'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| But one thing I would encourage you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| when you're looking at the dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| is really do make note of that information symbol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| that's really peppered across the dashboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| I will confess that I tend to overlook those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| and I did even when I first looked at the dashboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| but there's a lot of good information here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| to help define a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| What is rapid rehousing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| How are these measures being drawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| And if you're meeting with community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| that have these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| you can also lead them to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| Of course, Google is just our friend in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| a lot of good information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| So again, I'm gonna for the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| kind of avoid going over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| but obviously it'll be available for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| But just wanted to highlight now again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| in keeping with what Sean had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| about utilization rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| this is over the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| So emergency shelter, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| kind of fluctuating between 55 and 65% or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| And then if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| I may need to refresh this word to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| So here's permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| So again, just sort of a visual on the distinction there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| bumping up against 95, 96%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| on a pretty steady basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| as a sign of the need for additional affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| And that's always, for the last little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| there was actually a spike a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| and it stayed high that no affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| is the primary self-reported reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| why folks are becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| Among many other important factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| this is multifaceted, wickedly complex as we like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| but it is chief and foremost among the responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| that we've been getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| And so the other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| just because it's a one-stop shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| if you're talking to community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| you can point out that the annual report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| down here in the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| you can just click on more info| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| and that will take you to our annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| which does offer, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| a lot more kind of meaty in-depth information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| So you've got kind of the sort of the executive overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| level about all folks in HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| And again, you're gonna have folks come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| and I'm sure you already do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| they say there's 9,000 plus homeless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| And especially when you get into that annual level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| and you're seeing folks that a lot of whom are only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| homeless for a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8342)|
| 2:19:09| there's a lot of clarification that we can all help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| to make in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| And then I'll just share that there's a decent amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| of sort of information by subpopulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| to review as well further down in the annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| I think that's largely what I was gonna share about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| I will add, again, the link to this in the chat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| I'll also add my contact information, reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| If you have any questions, concerns, please don't hesitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| And if you have any questions tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| So thanks for the chance to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8397)|
| 2:20:03| Before we move to Chris, I just wanna note just briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| to brag a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| Every continuum of care across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| has an HMIS operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| but that dashboard that you were just looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| is a national model that we created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| to have the transparency available to elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| and to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8427)|
| 2:20:27| So we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| And we're also very proud of the work that you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| and the work that others have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| such as yourself or the community in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| that others have followed up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| how did you do that and had copied it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| So kudos to our HMIS team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| I had nothing to do with it, and yet I am unduly proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Thank you for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Any questions for Nate before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| I'm gonna go ahead and stop sharing my screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| so that we can talk more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| I don't think we have a chat function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| I was looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| So if you could email me, I would love the rest of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| And, oh, right, here I am saying that I'm gonna add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| all this stuff in the chat, and I'm just patently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| So thanks for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| I'd love to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Up next, we have Chris Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| He's the CHAMP coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| Again, works in SWARPs with Nate and the rest of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| Thank you, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| You have a slide for me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| Why don't you pop to that thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| So I wanna preface this by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| I am the CHAMP facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| CHAMP is not a product of SWARPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| CHAMP is a product of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| and our community providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| So it's important to know that this was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| and it's implemented by the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| that are following me in their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| So I wanna make that known that this is not a me thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| This is a them thing that I'm fortunate enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| to help facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8526)|
| 2:22:07| So I did wanna start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| What you're looking at right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| is kind of an at-a-glance snapshot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| of our coordinated entry system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| which is CHAMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| And Sean did a great job earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| explaining what a coordinated entry system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| is supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| But just to underline it a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| coordinated entry system should be a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| to funnel folks from homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| into their needed resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| Our coordinated entry system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| it looks very different than any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8559)|
| 2:22:40| And so this is a snapshot of what ours looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8560)|
| 2:22:44| So first on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| you'll see that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| the first point of entry into CHAMP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| is we have a number of data access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| So you'll see listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| and I'm sorry, that's small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| The Volunteer Ministry Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| is our primary data access point for all individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| And by individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| I'm talking about any conglomeration of adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| not caring for a dependent child or dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| So they're taking a big, giant load| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| of our homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| through those doors for CHAMP intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| The CAC is taking another big chunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| They're taking on youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| and that's defined as anyone 24 years and younger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| also families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| And that's any, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| conglomeration of adults caring for a dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8614)|
| 2:23:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| Did we lose Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8626)|
| 2:23:53| I think we might have some technical difficulties with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| I can pick up where he's going until he gets back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| just to give everyone an overview of kind of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| I think he's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| Yeah, I think he's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8648)|
| 2:24:08| I just saw your internet connections down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| is whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| And so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| Where did I leave off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| What did I miss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| I think you were at the entry point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| for families of children and homeless youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| and on the Volunteers of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8666)|
| 2:24:26| Volunteers of America is our designated access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| for our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| And we selected those designated access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| because those are largely gonna be the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| that are going to help case manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| and help those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| So those individual subpopulations into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| So that was done, not randomly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| that was done with purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| Also on here, we've got street outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| We do have street outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| who are able to help people walk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| some of the CHAMP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| So they're doing intakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| McNabb centers, they're doing intakes for their folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8696)|
| 2:25:01| What we wanna do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| while we have these designated access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| we also wanna have a no wrong door approach to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| So if somebody is coming to an agency in crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| we wanna be able to pull them into our CHAMP system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| and help them in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| So what happens at CHAMP intake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| The purpose is really twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| First of all, what we wanna do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| is kind of a crisis needs assessment, not kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| We do a crisis needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| What we want to be able to do is to triage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| to figure out what level of vulnerability they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| And then this gives us a way to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| one, do some crisis stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| and then it leads to the intake worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| making the most appropriate referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| So that's the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| that's one of the things that happens at intake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| crisis needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| And then it's a chance to converse about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| immediate crisis response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| Where are you gonna stay tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| Where are you gonna eat today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8762)|
| 2:26:03| So we wanna do both of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| within the context of the CHAMP intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| The end result of the CHAMP intake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| is a referral to case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| We wanted everyone within CHAMP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| to be walking alongside a case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| as they navigated the housing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| At the case management level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| we do, there's another assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| we do a housing needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| This is intended to shape a permanent housing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| We ask, at the end of this assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| we ask case managers to prioritize their client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| or their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| Our community's prioritization guidelines are objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| and scores correspond to homeless situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| length of homelessness, disabling condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| and the client's vulnerability score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| And so what we'll do with the prioritization score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| is to help us figure out where to send these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8814)|
| 2:27:00| in terms of what type of housing we should be pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| So we have, if you continue looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| if you look at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| it says the prioritization by vulnerability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| and need of need on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| there's this dropdown to two kind of separate buckets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| There's a rapid rehousing bucket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| and a permanent supportive housing bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| And I say that pretty broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| because it's kind of a catch-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| The permanent supportive housing bucket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| so at case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| we come up with a prioritization score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| and we try to funnel into what kind of category of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| are we gonna be looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| So whether it's housing that has support attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| or if it's maybe in the private market or subsidized market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| And so those are the two big buckets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| And what we do with those buckets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| this actually creates a by name housing list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| Once a week, we being case managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| housing providers need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| the permanent supportive housing by name list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| And this by name list is used during those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| when a housing vacancy arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| So say housing vacancy arises at Mbilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| we'll look at this by name list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| and we'll pick the top priority person or family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| to slide into that available unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| So again, the idea is to maximize our resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| by giving our resources to those most in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| So that's with the permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| Likewise, on the rapid rehousing level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| we have a weekly meeting where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| and this has been really enhanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| by our friends at House Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| and you'll hear more about them in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| House Knox is bringing individual units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| into this meeting, this rapid rehousing meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8930)|
| 2:28:53| We're looking at our rapid rehousing list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| and we're trying to attach based on need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| based on vulnerability, based on appropriateness of fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| clients, families to specific units in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| So again, we've got this pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| that kind of lands into two buckets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| and then we're actively talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| these real live individuals, real live families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| and trying to make sure that we send them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| to the most appropriate resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| So that's kind of a snapshot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| what the CHAMP system looks like in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| I will say CHAMP is an ongoing, adapting, complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| I'll use Nate's term, wickedly complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| It's a simplistic version of what CHAMP looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| It'd be impossible to capture the nuances of a CHAMP case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| in any form or diagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| So just take that as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| It would be great if it was that easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| but it's generally is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| So just a couple other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| CHAMP's primary goal is to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| that our limited resources are going to those most in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| From CHAMP's inception, May 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| to the end of January, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| to the end of this past year, so to January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| we've seen 2,919 heads of household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| go through the CHAMP system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| So 2,900 heads of household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| I say that because the heads of household,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| we kind of target the who is the main provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| and they may have dependents under them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| So of that 2,919, 824 found permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| on either affordable or permissportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| So in a sense, what I want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| is we have CHAMP as a system, it's a pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| to guide those experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| into available resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| When resources such as affordable housing aren't present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| the pipeline gets clogged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| And that's important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| If we were to take a snapshot of today's master lists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| we currently have 38 individuals and 11 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| that have been identified through case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| as needing permissportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| So roughly 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| Of the permissportive housing beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| that we have in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| we have one unit vacant for a single adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| and six for family units, six for families that are vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| So we see that the pipeline kind of getting really clogged up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| with a permissportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| Now, of those seven units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| we've already targeted individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| through those weekly meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| and we're aggressively trying to get those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| and families into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| Similarly, we have 70 heads of households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| in the rapid rehousing pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| And as an aside, I suspect that the numbers I gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| the 50 for permissportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| I suspect that's a little lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| just based on eligibility one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| and also just kind of trying to put in a bucket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9128)|
| 2:32:12| that might be more successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9132)|
| 2:32:13| We don't have any openings in permissportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| So maybe they're trying the bear market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| Anyway, so we have 70 heads of household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| in our rapid rehousing pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| And these are the ones seeking affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| either through subsidized apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| or within the private market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| So another sense of the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| and this may be a little unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| because this includes all individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| So this should be heads of households and dependents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| In December of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| there are 87 individual clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| again, including dependents that were entered into CHAMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| 32 exited the same month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| So 87 coming in, 32 going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| The next month, January of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| 56 coming in, 16 going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| February of 2021, 81 going in and 13 going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| So if you were to average those three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| you have 75 clients entering our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| per month and 20 exiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| So you see that there's a pipeline issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| and it's a pipeline issue that leans on the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| for permissportive housing, for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| I'm proud of the community's response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9205)|
