| 0:03:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| Moving on to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Item number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Consideration of changes to the delegation of final plat approval made by the Tennessee State Legislature pursuant to Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=197)|
| 0:03:26| Annotated 13-3-402C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=206)|
| 0:03:36| Item summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| In May of 2022, the Tennessee Legislature enacted Chapter 994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| This bill added the requirement of approval by the legislative bodies governing the areas served by the Regional Planning Commission to grant authority to the Planning Commission to delegate final plat approval to their professional staff for subdivisions up to 25 units in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=224)|
| 0:04:03| Due to an oversight, this authorization was not placed before County Commission or Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| On Monday, July 24th, County Commission will consider a resolution granting approval for the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission to delegate approval to staff for final approval of subdivision plats for subdivisions of 25 units or smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=252)|
| 0:04:31| Retroactive to May 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| City Council will consider a similar resolution on Tuesday, today, July 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| In anticipation of their approval of this delegation, a special called meeting will be held for the Planning Commission to consider the delegation of final plat approval pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated 13-3-402C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=283)|
| 0:05:01| Therefore, we need a motion to approve this item, giving authority to the staff to approve the plats subject to this item summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=301)|
| 0:05:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| We have a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| Any further discussion? Anyone? Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| How does it change anything that has already been operating? Does it? Is it? I mean, we're just codifying the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=331)|
| 0:05:40| Yes, primarily the thing that changes is that anything over 25 lots, the 26 or more, those as long as they didn't require variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=340)|
| 0:05:51| Those are staff level approvals and going forward, they will not be staff level approvals. Those will come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| But those are typically ones that you've already seen come before this body as a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| So a question, clarification on that as well. So the, just so I understand, so it's five lots or less can be approved at staff level with no variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=363)|
| 0:06:14| But if there is a variance, it still comes to planning then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| Up to 25 lots with no variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Up to 25 with no variance will stay at staff level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| At staff level approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| If it requires a concept plan, it comes before you though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| Did we know the motivation behind this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| I cannot speak to that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| If it's okay with commission, we normally don't go to the public, but if we have no objections, I'll let some folks speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| Is that before we vote? Is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=410)|

| 0:06:53| Hi, I'm Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| I urge you all to vote for this so that we can get back to the business of building houses quickly and efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| I'm Benny Moorman, Benchmark Associates, 10308 Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Wasn't going to say anything until you posed the question, how did this come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| I serve as the legislative chair for the Tennessee Association of Professional Surveyors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| We were aware of this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| We spoke with the sponsors of the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| I was advised that this would not affect this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| They said this was only for those planning commissions that were currently not approving plats at a staff level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| that this legislation would help them do so and that it should not adversely affect the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=459)|
| 0:07:52| I hope you'll go back and correct them on their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| Well, that's just what they told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230725?start=489)|
