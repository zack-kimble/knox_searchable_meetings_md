| 0:03:11| signed on behalf of Knox County to the State of Tennessee for 8 locations, give or take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=197)|

| 0:03:38| taking place in the small room, the small meeting room adjacent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=218)|

| 0:04:10| If not, we'll move into amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| I've passed around a piece of blue line that has a withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=253)|
| 0:04:22| It's actually in zoning, but I want to make sure that people know that it is withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| so that it will not be before us next week, next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| That's item number 64, 6F15RZ, and it was withdrawn by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=274)|

| 0:06:12| No motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=372)|

| 0:06:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Dwight VandeVeet, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Just a clarification, we can plug a number in on item 23, Resolution 408, as a blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| We can go ahead and give you the figure that's associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| Are you going to plug in figures on 23 and 24 both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| We're just going to plug in a figure on 23 and ask that 24 be moved without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Even with, and the, on item 23, what's the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| $2,266,626.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| I'll repeat it, $2,266,626.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| And I should mention that despite the fact that APAC Atlantic was the only bidder, Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Snowden managed to go back to them and negotiate a substantive reduction in this price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| And quite frankly, from a position of not much leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| So I just wanted to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Good work on his part, because when somebody's the only bidder, they necessarily don't come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| to the table with a lot of heart for negotiation, and he's done some awfully good work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Thank you, Mr. VandeVeet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| In keeping with the procedure that has come before us before, this will still be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| with no recommendation, because it had a blank in it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| Do I hear a motion that all that needs to be withdrawn is withdrawn, deferred, deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| items that will be discussed and added items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=471)|

| 0:08:35| So now do I hear a motion that the consent agenda be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| Make a motion that the consent be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=520)|

| 0:13:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=799)|

| 0:13:26| figures go inside the body of the proposal, the further resolved, and is that agreeable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=806)|

| 0:14:12| some figures plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=852)|

| 0:14:20| So the motion is before us, is no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=863)|

| 0:15:29| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Yes, but before I make the motion, you want me to give a little recap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=938)|

| 0:15:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| The reason that I want to postpone this is that our meeting last week, we had this dais full of experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| in the field, and bottom line is that we asked each one of those from each of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| these were all partners that will be involved in some of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| We asked them to put together their list of priorities and get them to Andy Black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| so that he could come back on April the 21st, I believe it is, with a proposal for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=971)|
| 0:16:22| a skeleton of what this thing could look like and where we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| So that's the process and where we are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Did I leave something out, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| It would be the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| 18th, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| The 18th at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| So based on that, I would make a motion that we defer this 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1000)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| For a month, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I don't see the total package being available, at least for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| April, May, June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| So let us get your motion to say defer until the June meeting of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| The motion before us is to defer until the June meeting of county commission is properly before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| is probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1045)|

| 0:17:29| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Also, if I can take a second and follow up on that, CARM is also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| last time Helen Ross McNabb was the only one that bid on the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| CARM has made a bunch of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| They are now interested in possibly putting their bid in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| So we have some interest now that we did not have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Cherokee Health Systems, I mean, CARM is interested in hosting the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| Cherokee, Tenova, some others are already on board with services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| So we are making some good progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| It's just a matter of putting this all together in a package and getting it out from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| Did I miss anything, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1099)|

| 0:19:15| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Mr. Holt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| I included a packet for each of the commissioners to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| I hope you guys had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| The majority of the changes are nomenclature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| They're changing the word purchasing to procurement to better reflect what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| Purchasing is a component part of procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Some of the other changes in there I would be happy to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| You have a summary of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| The changes outside the nomenclature changes were driven or recommended by the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| so they may like to speak to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| We don't necessarily have to go into it here, but one of those proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| there was some angst, and I'll have some questions, but this will go next week as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| This is the first time we've read an ordinance during me being this chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| But even if we will pass it, it still comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| It comes before us two months, but I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Do we have to have a motion today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| This will appear on next Monday's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| So this is more of a spread of the record than necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| We have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| It's going to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| We cannot pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Two more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| And it not come before us next Monday, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| So that kind of breaks with form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Normally if we pass something unanimous, it doesn't come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| So I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| We'll be talking about this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Ordinances have to be read twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Technically four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| So, Mr. Law Director, I'm still in a, do we have to have a motion of no recommendation today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| You can either do no recommendation or you can vote to recommend it for passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| It's got to go before this board twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| So I'll make a motion we move with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| The motion is probably before us and seconded, but Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| I just want to make the commissioners aware when we start voting on this and looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| On page three, item number three, best value means more than low cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| It includes the initial cost, service, quality, and other factors related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| And that's something, if you remember when we placed those bids on the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| how many construction companies were raising cane over the way it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| This is something I think we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Seeing no further discussion for today, this is probably before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| the motion is probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| I think now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1341)|
| 0:22:30| we do have line items to be voted on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Make a motion without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| They're not on our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1370)|
| 0:23:01| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| We're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| I do want to recognize that Mayor Burchard has proclaimed April 2016 as Fair Housing Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| He will have his proclamation next Fair Housing Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| A whole month of Fair Housing, April 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| That will be read next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| I think we're down to the presentation by the Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| I invited Carol Evans to come up and explain some things about Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| A lot of people don't know a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I didn't either until I was appointed to the board, and I became very excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| and I thought the rest of us should hear something about Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you, Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Name and address for the record, please, Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Carol Evans, 3505 Kesterwood Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| Thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| We actually celebrated our 10th anniversary this last year, and so it's a great opportunity to thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| Many of you weren't on commission at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| but Legacy Parks was really founded with the support from the city and county from the very, very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| So I appreciate Commissioner Busler's joining our board this year and has been real helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| but the opportunity to just take a quick few minutes to give you an overview of what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| and then invite you for the opportunity to work with you on some projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| We're known a lot for trails, but when you look at what Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| we really work around five areas of focus, preserving the ridges and views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| connecting our greenways and trails, maintaining the health of our waterways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| creating recreational opportunities for the underserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| and really exceeding the national average for green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| We've discovered that we compete very heavily with other cities for quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| and green space is one of those, that you get judged by the number of parks now that you have in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| So it has become an important economic driver for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| What we do is accept and acquire land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| and we've been very fortunate over the past 10 years to add about 400 acres of parkland in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| We raised a little over $4 million for parks, greenways, trails, and open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| and we've worked in the region, Knox Blount and the Sevier County, on conservation easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| which allow homeowners to long-term protect their land, keep it in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| So that's the basis of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| We promote outdoor recreation, and I think what might have been impactful for Commissioner Buslow to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| is we were fortunate to have a study done by the Baker Center this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| and what they discovered was currently with the trail system we've developed in south Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| we're currently seeing about $14 million of economic impact just from those trails alone, just from current use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| If we move to a position of making that a regional attraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| that will generate about $23 million in economic impact annually for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| If we're able to make it a national draw, you escalate that to about $52 million in economic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| and so we know there is great potential business in the outdoor industry and in outdoor recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| We've just recently done some things to begin to make it a national attraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| so outdoor recreation for Legacy Parks is really a way to create an economic driver around our natural assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| and we're seeing that and we're enjoying that and we're seeing the benefit of that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| We also do something that we're always happy to work with here on their project assistant agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| and I know Commissioner Brown and we've worked on several in south Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| If you have a small community group or a neighborhood group or a group just interested in a particular project of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| we can serve as their nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| They can fundraise around their initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Commissioner Anders invited me out to meet the Beaver Creek Kayak Club this last Tuesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| and that's a community-based group that's working very hard to create access to Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| So instead of forming their own nonprofit, they can work through us, apply for grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| raise funds around a specific practice and purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| and then they go back to just being neighbors and not having to run a nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| but they've gotten their project done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Everly Brothers Park, which you hear about a fair amount, in Bearden, all those funds come through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| We manage them, we audit them, we do those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| North in Fountain City, where you'll be later this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| a neighborhood wanted to put a small park on a remnant city lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Raised about $90,000, those neighbors did, created the beautiful Highland Avenue Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| and then they just go back and enjoy their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| So if you have a group of particular interest in your district that wants to do a park-related project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| an outdoor-related project, we're more than happy to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| As I told the commissioner the other night, we don't force ourself into any group that's already doing a really great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| We love to be invited in to work on projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| So we can serve that project assistance role for a lot of groups in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| and sort of harness the energy around neighbors that want to do things in their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| Just a reminder, and we're very, very grateful for the collaboration with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| you actually, the county, provided the original seed money to form the organization just some 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| and you've continued to do that throughout the time period at a rate of between $50,000 and $75,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| And for that, we'd like to provide as many services to you as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| and we want to work with those community groups to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| We always have a representative that you appoint to our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| We work in coordination with the city, the county, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| on making sure that the work that we do is really integrated a lot into the county park plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and reflects the county park plan or amends the county park plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| So we work very, very collaboratively on the long-term planning for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| And the other function that we serve is we sort of provide outdoor marketing and assistance services to visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| and I know you provide much of the funding through the Hotel Milltail Tax for Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| In return, we help recruit businesses here, help recruit events here that are related to outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| We just hosted the Professional Trail Builders Association last week in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| a couple hundred people coming to Knoxville to build trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| And we understand that their motel taxes are up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| so we'd love to think that outdoors is playing a role in getting people to come to Knoxville and stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| and stay in the county and sort of get out and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| I wanted to put the map on the board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| We've become a lot known for a lot of work in Commissioner Brown's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| but we do work throughout the county, have a variety of projects throughout the county over the past 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| everything from helping develop some trails and what we hope to be working in Eastbridge Business Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| using remnant industrial park land to create a trail system in a little bit of an underserved part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| to dog parks throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| PetSafe works through us on all their dog parks countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| We've just begun to work with Oak Ridge on their trail systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| which will benefit far deep west Knox County in terms of recreational amenities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| Fountain City Skate Park, Downtown State Park, Concord Dog Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| So we have a variety of projects throughout the county that we've been involved in over the past 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| and we're always happy to fill that map up a bit more if there are other projects that you know of particular interest in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| So our priorities coming up this next year are really to create –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| I changed that slide after I met with the Beaver Creek Kayak Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Increased river access was what it said, but truly getting people out on our waterways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| creating more public access points, working with TVA and TWRA on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| The Eastbridge equestrian trails, we hope to get the ground broken on that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| We are underserved with equestrian in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| There really aren't very few equestrian trails, but those will be multi-use trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| And again, using remnant land that's undevelopable, unusable, and turning it into recreational land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| The Iams to Alcoa Highway connection, we should be able to complete that so that you could actually walk on a trail there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| And once you pick up the Knox Blount Greenway, ultimately you're going to be able to go from Iams to Maryville on a trail or a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| The G&O Trail, excited about a rail-to-trail project just on the south side of the river from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| That'll be a three-mile trail that'll get you from Chapman Highway into Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Regional connections, we are working with our adjacent counties to create trail systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| They've been asking and bringing the region together, but always making Knox County the epicenter of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| So we want people to come here, stay here, venture out into the county, but to be sure that they're staying in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| And then we'll continue to increase economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Since we've been in business, there's been four new outfitters, a brand-new retailer, REI, coming into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| And REI is a very, very smart company that only goes to outdoor cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| And they chose Knoxville, and they chose Knoxville over Chattanooga because they said Knoxville is a great outdoor community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| And so what we hope to do is build the assets so that the outdoor industry really thrives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| and we can see economic benefit from it in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| And as we like to say, you know, our goal really is to leave East Tennessee better than we found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| And the other expression I love, it's a throw, which says heaven is below our feet as well as above our head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| And so we just do our little bit of park for East Tennessee heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| So thank you again for your support, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with all of you in your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1956)|
| 0:32:48| Mayor Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Yeah, I was going to kind of talk a little bit about what Carol talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| There's a community group or a group of neighbors that have gotten together in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and the Legacy Parks was given some land that was floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| and they've made a water retention or rainwater park that does nothing but control the rainwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| And so Dwight and his crew and Doug and their crew went and cleaned out from Harrell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| which is Oak Ridge Highway where Grace Baptist is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| And you can float all the way down to the sports park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| It's about a four-hour float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| And eventually you'll be able to get, they cut away some of the jams on the other side of the sports park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| You'll be able to get to Melton Hill in about seven hours total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| So they're doing a great job out there, and Carol was invited by them and myself to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| and lend their support and help for that, and I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| And hopefully we can, you know, Beaver Creek's the only creek in Knox County that starts in Knox County, ends in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| and hopefully we can get connected with District 7 and Bustler's groups over there in Powell and Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| and eventually Gibbs and Coryton and float all the way across the northern part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| And I think it's pretty neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| It's a long-term project, but it's pretty neat, and I appreciate you coming out there and helping with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| One of the things I wanted you to really hear about the economic impact that her group has on Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| for the amount of money that we're putting into it as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| We're getting a great return on our money, and I want to thank Carol for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| You must be kind of tired, Carol, because in your meetings you're a lot more demonstrative than you are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| I mean, she's probably on Ritalin right now, but she's always very excited at what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| And the big thing was you're talking about kayaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| We've had people that start at Clayton Park in the Halls area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| and gone all the way underneath Clinton Highway into District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| It can be done, but we need more work out there to open it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| and there's people out there all the time on those creeks kayaking down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| and they do a great job because they pick up a lot of trash along the creek itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| So, Carol, I would just say I'm appreciative that you let me sit on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| and every now and then say something, and I appreciate you putting Beaver Creek back on the main list for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you, Ms. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Seeing no further discussion, the next discussion item is regarding Knox County Recreation Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2119)|
| 0:35:27| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| A couple of months ago during our open forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| a Knox County resident, Paul Johnson, appeared before commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| complaining about a record service bill he received from just towing his vehicle from an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| Just towing it a few miles included a $350 tow charge, gate fee of $50, and clean-up $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| And we kind of looked at some of that, and since that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| I have been looking at some of the different record services in Knox County and the different charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| They're not any of them the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| For instance, yesterday, I think it was the day before yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| I found that there is a record company in West Knox County that charges $250 administration fee for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| So it is just across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| The charges are just across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| And if you have a great insurance company or if you have money, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| but if you are not and don't have, then it could be a real problem for you and your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| So, you know, the city of Knoxville has a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| They control the record prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| I think for a regular car, it's $144 is the maximum tow charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| which is very reasonable in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| However, my purpose is not to tell them what they can charge or control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| It's more to find out what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| And I had a TV interview the other day, and they asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| what would you say to someone, and I have three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Before I'd let anybody tow my car, I'd want to know how much is it going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| how much is your gate fee, and how much is your storage fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| You could leave your car there and you could never get it back if you didn't have a lot of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| It could go that high very fast, and it happens to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| There are two vehicles in the Sunday newspaper that are being sold at auction because of the lot fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| One of them is a 2006 model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| So, obviously, it's across the board in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| I've asked a speaker to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Mr. McGovern, would you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| This is Michael McGovern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| He has the McGovern Law Firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| And if you recognize his name, and I think some of you do, his father ran a tow company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| He probably started driving tow trucks at a young age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| What did you start at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| Legally or illegally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| Legally at 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| But he represents just about every tow company in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| And this is something that I hope that we can find a solution to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| and he has an idea that might be a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| So I'm going to turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| If you would kind of explain what's going on in Knox County with the tow companies and the record companies right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| And, sir, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| My name is Michael McGovern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| My address is 3021 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| And, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| and Mr. Brantley, thank you for having me come down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Yes, I have a pretty lengthy background with the towing business in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| I grew up in it, as you said, and do represent most of the towing companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| Let me give you a little bit of background on charges for towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| In particular, what we're talking about is police towing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| where a vehicle is ordered to be towed by the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| And in Knox County, you've got three primary police jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| You've got the city of Knoxville, you've got the county sheriff's department, and you've got the highway patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| As you pointed out, the city of Knoxville has an ordinance that has set prices in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| and the towing companies that tow for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| it's a voluntary system, it's a voluntary program, and they participate on a rotating call list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| and the city police department will dispatch them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| and they agree to charge the rates that are set forth in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| The Tennessee Highway Patrol has a little different system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| The Tennessee Highway Patrol has a rotating list, again, it's a voluntary list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| The tow operators agree to participate on the tow list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| and they submit a rate sheet to the highway patrol that is approved by the highway patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| Now, they're not all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| It's not a set fee, but the highway patrol assures that they're all within a reasonable range of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| That's the way the highway patrol does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Now, the county sheriff's department has neither system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| And as you accurately pointed out, there is no formal regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| and there's really no informal regulation with the sheriff's department tows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| And typically what's happened is it's controlled just by a fair and reasonable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| And generally, over the many years that I've been involved with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| it's been the practice of the towing industry to charge a fair and reasonable rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| and there usually hasn't been very many complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Granted, occasionally there are complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Somebody will be out of line, or I hear something like a $350 tow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| I don't know what the circumstances of that were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| It could have been down in a ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| It could have involved hours of recovery work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| I wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I didn't hear the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| But let's say there was an extenuating circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| and it's just a tow that seems to be out of sync with the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| So I appreciate your concern about trying to do something to control the rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| that are charged by the towing companies that serve the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| However, I think the problem has been solved in the state legislature this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| and Mr. Brandley and members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| you're not the first people in the state of Tennessee to raise these complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| And there was a bill introduced this year in the legislature that addresses this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| and it has passed the House committee, and it is on the calendar for the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2473)|
| 0:41:25| It actually was on the Senate calendar last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| but it was postponed because their agenda went too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| By the way, I'm the lobbyist for the statewide towing association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| so that's why I'm familiar with that piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And here's what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| This is statewide legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| It says that tow rates that are towed at the direction of a police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| cannot be any higher than the highest rate approved by the highway patrol in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| So for Knox County, what that would mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| it means that the tow rates for the companies that tow for the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| cannot be any higher than the rates that have been approved by, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| highway patrol district two is what the highway patrol district is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| It could be no higher than the highest rate that's been approved by the highway patrol in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| So at least in my opinion, that seems to resolve the issue of rates that have absolutely no maximum cap on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| There is a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| This legislation is certain to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| and I think that resolves the issue that you've had and that some citizens have had here before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| And I welcome any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Yes, Mr. McGovern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you for coming and explaining that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Number one, do you have the Senate and House bill numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Do you know those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| The Senate bill is Senate Bill 2334 by Senator Tracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| and the House bill is 2402 by Representative Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| How often do the THP rates change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| And when you say they hand out a sheet, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| how do we make sure that each deputy or each trooper and each, I guess in this sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| each deputy would have their current rate sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I mean, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Well, it doesn't now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| It's a brand new procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| But I assume it would be a simple matter for a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| You said that the THP already does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| How does the THP have the rate sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Do they not have it all the time with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| They have them on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| They have the rate sheets on file in their Knoxville office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| So, for instance, if you wanted to find out what's the maximum rate for this type of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| you'd call the Highway Patrol office and they'd be able to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| But the troopers don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| You can give it to the citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| So they don't know whether they could or could not be charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| No, but if a citizen thinks it's out of line, they'll call the Highway Patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| Not if they think it's out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| If it's $20 here, $20 there, more than the higher rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| how do they know that they're not paying, they're paying the trooper rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| I think one of the things that we brought up. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Did I interrupt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| One of the things that was brought up by this discussion was the fact that the consumer doesn't know what the rate is, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| And so they're in shock and they just had an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| And that's a lot of stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| Yeah, let me address that because I heard you say you made some comments on the news about here's three questions you would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| And your point is well made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| In the case of an accident, you know, how much they're going to pay for this tow fee is the least of their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| because, one, as you said, they're rattled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| They're upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| They may be injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| They may be in the back of an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Two, they've got insurance, so they're really not too concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| And it could be they're arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| A lot of times people aren't even on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| So there's not an opportunity to ask those questions, those three questions that you ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| So it's sometimes impossible to disclose to anybody what the rate's going to be at the scene of the tow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| You know, if a guy's being arrested or he's being hauled off to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| there's not an opportunity, as Commissioner Anders suggested, to disclose to that person what the rate's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| So you've got to have it kind of on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| You've got to be able to verify it on the back end after the tow is already made, and that's what this state bill does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| And, you know, again, I don't know how familiar you are with the details of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| so I may be asking an unfair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| But I do know that Region 2 is probably larger than Knotts County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| You're talking about Highway Control Region?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I think it includes three or four counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| And the reason I'm asking that is because I'm wondering how they quote their rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| Is it a per mile rate, or is it a kind of a general rate based on circumference of the area of Region 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2747)|
| 0:45:57| And my concern is, I'll go ahead and tell you my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| If it's four counties wide, they've quoted a maximum rate that's four counties wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| and Knotts County might be able to charge that four-county rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| So, again, I'm not familiar with the details of how this deal with the state highway patrol is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| but I'd be very interested on that before we kind of blanket adopt these bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| because we may want to limit that once we find out the details on how they quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| on how they put their budgets and their mins and their maxes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Again, I don't know if you're familiar with that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| I guess it is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| And the way the highway patrol does it, if, and I think Hamblin County, say, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| Hamblin County is in District 2 of the highway patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| The tow companies in Hamblin County would file their rate sheets with the highway patrol office here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| and they would file those rate sheets under Hamblin County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| and then Roane County would have the rate sheets for Roane County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and then Knox County would have the rate sheets for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| So it would be a simple matter if the commission was inclined to impose some kind of rule to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| must comply with the Knox County rate, if that's what you're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Quickly, I'll look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Tennessee Highway Patrol, we're in District 1, which is 11 counties stretching from Scott to Monroe, just FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2842)|
| 0:47:31| You're saying it passed the committee in the House, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| It didn't pass the House yet, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| No, it's passed the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| It's before the calendar and rules committee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| And is it a chance to add where there would be every officer could have a rate card or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Could that be added to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| I'll leave that up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| If this is passed, when will it take effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Immediately, effective upon passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Really do appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| The towing services submit their rate sheets to the Highway Patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| Are those rates either accepted or rejected, or do they just submit what they're going to charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| They're accepted or rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| It's kind of an informal regulatory system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| They don't disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| The towing companies don't know who or, theoretically, they don't know what everybody else is submitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| The Highway Patrol looks at it and makes a determination as to whether it's within the range of other rates that have been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| There's not a set rate, and the rates are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| I know that for a fact, but they're within the ballpark of one another, and that's the way the Highway Patrol system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| What is the range they are within?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Right now, this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| I couldn't tell you, but it's probably comparable to what the city has now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| And you can find the rate sheets on the Department of Safety website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| You can pull up what their rate sheet looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| Commissioner Thomas, I don't know if that's what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| but if you go to the Highway Patrol website under commercial vehicles, the link to commercial vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| it has the application form and it has the rate sheet that's filed when they apply to be on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2965)|
| 0:49:36| And it breaks down different types of tows, heavy, you know, small car towing, midsize towing, heavy truck towing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| storage fees, mileage charges, labor charges, you know, winching time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| It has a whole array of charges on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| But to tell you, do I know what the rates are this year that have been filed in this district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Can you explain the process of how they vet and come to what they consider a reasonable rate to accept to put on the sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| I have a copy here of what Knox County, this is what Knox County government pays to towing services that tows a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| And this would be for a car, pickup truck, SUV, vans, minivans up to three-quarters ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| The county agrees to pay $75 initial price for five miles of towing and then $2.50 for each additional mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3026)|
| 0:50:35| Very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Now, that's what the county, our county, has negotiated with the towing companies that operate here, the full county thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| So I don't think Knox County is going to pay a $250 administration fee and I don't think they're going to pay a $50 gate fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| I don't think they're going to pay any of these excessive charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| This is what they say we will pay in Knox County to pull a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Well, look, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| This is a completely different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| This is an invitation to bid county-owned vehicles, which the tower can tow basically at their convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| The other type of thing that I was talking about with the Highway Patrol in the city, those are emergency on-call type situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| There's more expense involved in those type of tows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| If the county calls and says, look, we've got an animal control vehicle broke down on Baxter Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| they don't have to go immediately and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| They may get it a couple hours later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| That's why these rates are much lower than your emergency on-demand rates that you see in police towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3092)|
| 0:51:41| I did see that in the commission package tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Getting back to Sam's question a little bit ago about the different counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| and according to Commissioner Thomas, we're 11 counties in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| I would assume from what you're saying, to explain it out a little further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| that each county would submit what their rates would be for their particular county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| They would be approved by THP for that particular county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| So if you're in Hamlin County, they're not going to charge Knox County rates if they might be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| They're going to be charging Hamlin County rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| So they're going to be charging for whatever county they're pulling in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| That's for the Highway Patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| So I can see where there would be a difference between an emergency tow and a tow when we can get to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| but Knox County isn't required to pay gate fees or things like that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| And that's my understanding, Ed, that that's part of the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| The excessive additional fees that go along with a tow is part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| And it's my understanding that Knox County does not pay any of those additional fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| We generally don't take it to their lot either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| We take it to where we're going to get it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Well, let me give you an example of someone who had a very nice SUV towed from Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| and they wanted it towed to their company, which is on Clinton Highway, after an accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| and they were riding in the wrecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| The wrecker, unfortunately, could not tow the vehicle that was so big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| so they had to go back to the towing service to go in and get another wrecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| That included an additional $400 charge on their bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| That towing bill ended up being over $900,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| and I can give you a copy of it if you want it, over $900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| If I might address the gate fee issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| a gate fee typically is a charge that the towing company will charge to come after hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| and release a vehicle if their shop is closed at, say, 8 o'clock at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| and somebody calls them at 12 o'clock and says, I'd like to come and get my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| They typically allow what's called a gate fee to go down and open the gate to allow that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| and that ranges usually typically $30, $35 for somebody to come down and open the gate and charge a gate fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| In this legislation that I just referred you to, there's a provision about gate fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| and it says that you cannot charge gate fees on the same day that you charge storage fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| So if you're going to charge storage fees, you better be able to release the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| You can't have it both ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| and that is included in those bills that I just referred you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| So maybe that solves some of that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Well, one quick statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| It's not necessarily for you, Mr. McGovern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| but it would be nice to get, because things change and words get added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| You know, I can take a look at the Senate bill, House bill, but things morph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| and I would like to verify that we can, in fact, not be imposed the 11-county high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3295)|
| 0:55:05| I mean, it sounded like that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I'm just hoping that that language appears in those bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| that it's the Knox County fee high will set the norm for the county and the city and the other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3311)|
| 0:55:21| Well, for your reference, and, again, I don't have the facts and figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| but I would be fairly certain that the Knox County rate is going to be the highest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| It would be higher than, like, Sevier County, where it's up and down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| I'm going to think that it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| And realize this legislation was the attempt, the General Assembly was trying to deal with the statewide, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| trying to take care of the statewide issue, and this was kind of a compromise plan to deal with what this has come up in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3343)|
| 0:55:54| So they didn't get that particular about county by county by county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| I think they were pretty glad just to get something in place, even if it was on an entire district basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| It's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| I just want to thank you for coming down here and thank you for being kind of a ray of sunshine in this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| because calling towing companies, asking questions, they're not real happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| It's probably a lot of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| But you've been very forthcoming and as helpful as you can, and I certainly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| Well, Mr. Brantley, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I've represented a lot of towing companies, and that's the first time I've ever been called a ray of sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| I was just looking at the Senate Transportation and Safety Committee, which the Senate bill is currently on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| It was placed on their final calendar last week, but this week they're not scheduled to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| So hopefully they will meet one more time before the end of session so this gets handled this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| Yeah, that's why they just the Senate committee starts at 530 in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| and they had a huge calendar and they just didn't get through it, and they were not meeting this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| so they put it to the final calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| So they haven't scheduled that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| They haven't scheduled it yet, but I'm confident that it's going to be, that it will pass the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| I'm confident it's going to become law this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| And they'll adopt the House Amendment 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Yes, if they haven't already, they will, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I want to make this one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| I had three different record companies when this was brought up at our last meeting come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| and they said we know that there are people out there that are taking advantage of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| They said the majority of record services are upstanding citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| so let's don't get in this mood that everybody out there is out there to rip somebody off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| We just need to look at the rogues that are out there right now that are taking advantage of a certain situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| So, again, I thank you for coming down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| but like I said there's some really good record services out there too that charge a reasonable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| This question is for Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| I was just reviewing the receipt from the Sutherland Avenue record company that you provided us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| and it's got the gate fee on here of $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| Did that individual that you spoke to, did he go in after hours to collect his vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| or did he go during normal business hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| No, he did it during normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| It's my understanding he went on normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| But they still charged him a $50 gate fee according to this invoice from Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| Well, he didn't charge him anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| He took his title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| He took his title up to get the vehicle out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| So that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| And they would not give him an item out of his bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| And that's not good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Those are issues certainly the commission may want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| But now that legislation addresses that gate fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| If he charged, does the bill reflect that there were storage fees charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| There were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| No, it says $350 tow fee, gate fee $50, cleanup $50, and then a blank total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| So we don't know exactly what he did pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| That's the only bill that the person could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| And they had to write that in front of him and would not give it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| He had to take a picture of it with his cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| And no receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Well, that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Mr. McGovern, is it the same, the bill of rights, the towing bill of rights that I think the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| Is that separate from the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| It's just what your rights are as far as, is that what you're talking about in getting out of my bill and doing all that other stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| Is that something that has passed and been successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| Well, that's not in the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| That is in the city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| The city ordinance, I don't know if it's in the ordinance or if it's one of their rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| but the city police department requires that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| And quite frankly, I'm not sure how much it's actually used and how much that's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| But it is a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| And, again, I don't know if it's in the ordinance or if it's in a police department reg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| But if the, and, again, many, many times the vehicle owner or the driver of the vehicle is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| There's nobody to give the disclosure to because they've been arrested, they've been injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| Well, when you pick up your car, you can sure have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| At that point in time, you should get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Seeing no further discussion, thank you, Mr. McGovern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Moves us down to our city ordinance and send it to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| The last discussion is a discussion item that we've added related to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| The Audit Committee met earlier this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| Next meeting of the Audit Committee will be May 23 at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| That's in front of the regular scheduled stated meeting of County Commission the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| I've been asked by Commissioner Broyles to relay her request that you accept her stepping down from the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3663)|
| 1:01:13| and the CAC Committee so that at some future meeting now of County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| we will need to make appointments to those two standing committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| or those two committees to which the commission makes appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| That's one person to the Audit Committee and one person to the CAC Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3690)|
| 1:01:39| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| I just wanted to say that I'll be able to do CAC Board this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| They usually meet Thursday after commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| but I would like to have somebody in place if possible for the April meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| because I will not be able to be at the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| So if there's someone who is willing to step up for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| and if you need to look over CAC's web page and see everything that they're involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| they run a lot of really important programs not just for the county but for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| So if there's someone who's really interested or passionate in any of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| that would be fantastic to have someone to take over who is really on board with what CAC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3744)|
| 1:02:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| And thank you for your comments there, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| The only possible way of receiving nominations, of making those appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3756)|
| 1:02:47| is going to be through this commission meeting, not this commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| but a subsequent commission meeting because it's an item that we'll have to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| So we will have to have nominations from members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3776)|
| 1:03:04| We'll have to have someone say they would be willing to serve on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| and then we will have to have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Commissioner Brown had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Can that not be done today and vote on next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| I was going to say the only way it can be done on Monday is for it to be added by three-quarters of a vote of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| at the beginning of the meeting Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| You could send them out, but it would have to be added by three-quarters of the commission Monday to do both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3814)|
| 1:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| We possibly could have three-quarters of commission decide that we need to do this at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| That's what you had to come prepared to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| Just a second, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Commissioner Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| So would they need to let you know or me know or Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| How would they notify someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| No, because this is an item we have to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| We cannot discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| It has to be done in this open meeting of a regular meeting of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| So they would need to, if we wanted to do it on next Monday then, they would need to bring it up to add to next Monday's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| or put it on the agenda for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| As long as it's done by the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| I would propose that we have an agenda item added to the next, to the full commission meeting requiring three-quarter vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3868)|
| 1:04:39| and I sponsor that, and then people will have to say they would like to be on those committees and we'll have to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Now then, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| He's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| We are talking about the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| and while you mull over where we stand with audit committee and CAC appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| let me make these brief comments about the audit committee which was held today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| I made the comments in the audit committee meeting that Mr. Mike Hammond, the clerk of criminal courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3910)|
| 1:05:19| Mr. Ed Schaust, the Knox County trustee, and Mr. Foster Arnett, the Knox County court clerk, were in attendance at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3919)|
| 1:05:29| It should be duly noted by commission that these elected officials in Knox County are appropriately responding to the audit committee as we expect they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3929)|
| 1:05:40| Also, I commend Commissioner Brown and I are members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| Also present were Commissioners Bussler, Commissioner Schoonmaker, and Commissioner Oyenbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| I recognize your attendance at the meeting, knowing what's going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3954)|
| 1:06:03| At the meeting, we were given a report by the Knox County Fraud and Compliance Hotline Group saying that we've had, we must have four, we've got five open reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3963)|
| 1:06:18| Four of those reports have some age. Two are referred to the DA's office and when asked by Knox County of the DA's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3978)|
| 1:06:31| they will not comment because of ongoing investigation of those two reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| Two other reports are currently referred to the internal county auditor and relate to schools and we will receive reports in due time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=3998)|
| 1:06:49| And then one new report this month required special handling and that lies with the chairman of the audit committee and I do not know the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4009)|
| 1:07:08| Or where it will be headed. That's to be handled by the, by our charter, is to be handled by the audit committee chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4028)|
| 1:07:20| Also in attendance today were the external auditors and the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| Nothing really to report from the external auditor's perspective except to say that they will be engaging Knox County again this coming summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4047)|
| 1:07:38| beginning with the school activities funds and working through the annual audit after the close of the books here at mid-year or at the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4058)|
| 1:07:48| Also the internal auditor had items that Commissioner Brown and I will try to get you information on what internal audits may be occurring over the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4068)|
| 1:08:00| and also information as relates to our internal auditor having a peer review which will be funded in the upcoming annual budget of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4080)|
| 1:08:13| With those brief overviews, are there any questions of full commission of members of the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4093)|
| 1:08:23| Commissioner Brown, do you wish to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| No, I think you've pretty much covered the nuts and bolts of what we talked about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| I'd just like to reiterate the one comment that I made at the audit committee with those other elected officials here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4113)|
| 1:08:44| that when you look at the fact that when some of us came on board, we were in the aftermath of Black Wednesday or whatever day it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4124)|
| 1:08:57| But as the old Virginia Slim commercial says, I think that our Knox County election officials have come a long way, baby, in this last seven, eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4137)|
| 1:09:07| And I congratulated them for the openness and the cooperation that they've given our auditors and also the external auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4147)|
| 1:09:18| I think that we're moving in the right direction in all of these offices now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| We had the three major ones here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| So I just want to again publicly say thank you to all of those for the fine job we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| I failed to ask earlier today if there was anyone here to speak public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| I ask that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Is there public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| If not, seeing no further lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| is there anything, any further business to come before this work session, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| One question probably Bob Thomas could answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| You can stand up back there, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Monday we're going to talk about school bus safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| The idea was proposed to me this weekend that in order to kind of get a grip on this and handle on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| that each commissioner might choose if we were allowed to ride a bus one day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4218)|
| 1:10:27| Would that be permissible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| Let me check on that just to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| Please say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| I don't have to ride if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Let me check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| I've not had that request before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Yeah, I just want to, one, let everyone know that at West Hills this Saturday at 10 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4254)|
| 1:11:03| anybody, we're having an Easter egg hunt for that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4263)|

| 1:11:28| It's weightlifting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| We wish you speedy recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160321?start=4294)|
