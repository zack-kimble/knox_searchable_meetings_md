| 0:03:09| The next permit is Big Orange Billiards and Brews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Gary Viles, 9117 Old Tassel Pike, Luttrell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| And our understanding is that you are taking over the former location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=211)|

| 0:03:44| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| Mr. Burr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| We just need inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Council Member Roberto, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Mr. Viles, just a couple of questions for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| following up on what the Chair was asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| So you're totally buying out Mr. Lawhorn and Billiards and Brews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Yes, I am, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| And will Mr. Lawhorn have anything to do with either the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| or the ownership of Big Orange Billiards and Brews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| No, sir, not whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| And is Mr. Lawhorn's Billiards and Brews going out of business with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| I'm going to toss to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Well, this is obviously involving where Billiards and Brews is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| and the beer board is familiar with the history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| Now, the beer board, as you all know from serving for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| regularly approves a permit pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Over the years, that documentation has included things such as the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| inspection, the building inspection, the health department inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| as well as surrender of the existing permit in possession of the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| We'll actually be in that circumstance coming up for Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| But in those circumstances necessitating the surrender of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| beer permit prior to giving the new applicant, Mr. Viles in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| his beer permit, the board has required the existing permit to be surrendered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| to the business tax office as there can't be two beer permits for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| location or premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| The rationale has always been this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| If the board authorized two permits for one location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| enforcement of the regulations for alcoholic beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| both beer and liquor, would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Both the Knoxville Police Department and the TABC need to know which permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| a business is operating under in order to properly enforce the laws relating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| to the management, sale, and serving of beer and alcoholic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| Allowing two permits for one location would also be contrary to Section 4-58| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| of the Beer Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| In the present circumstance, and listening to what Mr. Viles has represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| it appears the previous permit holder has sold his business to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| However, the previous permit holder has appealed the revocation of his beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| permit to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| Until a judge makes a final ruling on the previous permit holder's appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| there's a chance the previous permit holder's beer permit could be reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| So at this time, if the board is inclined to grant this applicant a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| for this location and the former permit holder's appeal is successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| the end result could be two permits for this one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| To avoid that possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| one possible solution would be to pass the permit pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| including a condition which requires the applicant to give to the business tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| office a signed release from the previous permit holder that Billiards & Brews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| LLC, the business that Mr. Viles is purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| has released all of its rights to the previous beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| and is no longer appealing the revocation of its permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=449)|
| 0:07:39| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Just a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| The previous permit holder, even if they, how do I phrase this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| even if revocation was unsuccessful or their beer permit was reinstated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| they've sold the business, so wouldn't that be kind of useless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and therefore not a risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Well, you'd have two people holding a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| supposedly for the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| so we'd especially submit to consider to avoid that possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| where the Billiards & Brews goes ahead and voluntarily surrenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| and drops its appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| That would give a clean break for Mr. Viles and his business partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Mr. Viles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Are you aware of whether Billiards & Brews intends to appeal the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=523)|
| 0:08:54| Are you aware of anything that Mr. Frost was talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| The only thing I'm aware of is the liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| I don't know anything about the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| It was suspended a year and three months ago, I believe, March of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| I was just wanting to see if you had any information about that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| So what I'm hearing from our attorney is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| we can't have two permits out at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| So I can make a motion to approve pending file documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| but we're going to have to amend that documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| to include some kind of document from the former beer permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| that says that they are relinquishing their rights to that beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| and not going to appeal it because we can't give you a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| and have another permit existing for the same location out there at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Does that all make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Mr. Frost, did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| To clarify, and I've never met Mr. Viles before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| but there is currently pending in Knox County Chancery Court litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| where they are trying to get their revoked beer permit back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| So he might not be aware of it, which is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| but that is presently pending in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| So I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Yep, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Given that the permit is issued for the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| if the landlord has terminated the lease agreement with Mr. Lawhorn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| and entered into a lease agreement with Mr. Viles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| would that also not represent a clean break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Generally speaking, on rare occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| people have come before the beer board maybe once every three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| where two people claim to have rights to the same premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| and that's a predicament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| and that's seen as a dispute between the two potential tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| and not members of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| So when those do come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I always encourage the beer board to let the tenants work it out between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| themselves and not get in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| So I don't know the circumstances of what all is going on between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| landlord, this gentleman, his business partner, and the other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=675)|
| 0:11:23| When I spoke to the landlord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| she wanted to break all ties with Mr. Lawhorn because of legal action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| so she eliminated him completely from anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| So I do know that's the case on this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| Well, on the advice of our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| I'd suggest we make a motion to – well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I'll make a motion to approve pending file documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| but adding an element to that where we need to have something from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| current beer permit holder that relinquishes any further appeal or action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| for them to have a beer permit going forward for that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Is that right, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| To put a finer point on that, Mr. Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| that in the eyes of the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| he does not hold a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| It was revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| His position being Billiards & Brews is that it was wrongfully revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| So I don't want to – that's how Mr. Lawhorn and his Billiards & Brews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| sees it versus how the law department sees it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| One more question before we move forward with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| So pending final documentation or an agreement between the previous permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| holder, is that potentially through the entire judicial process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| The idea of the pending final documentation would be to avoid the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| of two beer permits for one location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| and that can be resolved by Mr. Biles getting something in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| from the other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Is that clear to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Yes, ma'am, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| So do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Motion, second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Next up is Bombay Palace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| My name is Nick Hilbugga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Our address is 10901 Parkside Drive, Suite 101, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| You want to tell us a little bit about your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| The restaurant was opened in 2011 with a previous owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| and it was a family-run business, and I happen to do some real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| so I know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| They talked about selling it, and I made an agreement with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| and we took over in May, and it's run the same way, same recipes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| everything, just a little change in ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| And at some point we'll be doing some renovation, but not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=883)|

| 0:30:09| Still voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| So you don't sell any alcohol or beer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| What do you guys do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Currently we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| We were a hookah lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| We're kind of moving away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| We're going to focus more on a college-centric business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| There's obviously with game days, campus growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| we see the demand there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| We want to cater more to that audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| So no books at the bookstore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| No books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| But if your college kids do charge their credit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| it will say the bookstore LLC, so they'll be studying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| That's the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Very smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Don't tell everyone, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| When I was in school, the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| This is our take on the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| As a librarian, I'm going to think about this business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Where were you when I was in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Next is Neyland Stadium, Aramark Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Mike McDonald with Aramark, 2128 Bayerun Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15237.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| We're looking to combine the beer permits for Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| There's currently two issued, one for the general bowl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| and one for the premium areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Sports and Entertainment is going to start service in the premium areas this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| so we want to surrender the two we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| and get a new beer permit covering the entire facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| So you'd only have a single permit for all of Neyland Stadium, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| That's what the ultimate goal is, to have one for the entire building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Sergeant Howard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| We need inspections and fire approvals and then surrender of those existing permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Thank you for the conversation that we had beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| I'm going to abstain from this vote and the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Last time you were before us, we had a conversation about IntelliCheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Can you talk to us, give us an update on using that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Yes, we have deployed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| We deployed them at the end of the football season last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| We've been using them since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| We've got a device for every server,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| so in the neighborhood of 160 servers that are connected directly to the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| we've got a way to have them live at the stadium despite the cell signal and the Wi-Fi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| But they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| And we were talking before the meeting, they have been turning up fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| So it's a system that is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| And they will be deployed at Neyland all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| And then I know you had a third party, I believe it was HS Brands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| that at one point last year had committed, you had assigned them to do compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Are you still using them or another party to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| We still do compliance checks, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| And I think last time we spoke you were going to do that every game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Is that your intention to do that this fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| And then once again, Thompson Bowling Arena, Aramark Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Again, we're looking to combine the beer permits for the entire facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| We will be doing the servicing the crowd for the athletic events at the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| And we're just going to combine it to one beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| And then is it correct that you have a second permit for special events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| There is a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| There is a permit for higher ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| They will be doing things other than sporting events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| So sports and entertainment will do sporting events only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| and the higher ed will maintain their permit for other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Their inventory is not commingled, different staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| and there's a separation between the bowl and the suite area where beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| won't be able to pass back and forth on those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Sergeant Cowan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| We would need inspections and fire approvals and surrender of the existing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| I move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Moving on to the addendum items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| First up is craft axe throwing of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2109)|
| 0:35:20| Russell Abercrombie, 320 North Peter Street or North Peter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| It used to be K-Town Tavern, but we're broken out into suites now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| I do have a suite number associated with that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| It's 107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| And your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Russell Abercrombie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| You want to give us an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| The construction is real slow, so we're going to need an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220823?start=2138)|
