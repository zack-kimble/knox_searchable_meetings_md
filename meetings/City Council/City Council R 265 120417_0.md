| 0:08:06| departments within the city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=486)|

| 0:08:10| of support and anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| we've needed people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| provided whatever that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| could. What I'd like to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| just give you a brief overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| of the operations starting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Sunday and where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| On Sunday our initial operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| when we responded to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| focused on obviously three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| things, containing it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| site, protecting exposures and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| then beginning extinguishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| We had five engines, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| ladders, approximately twenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| five personnel on site. We were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| able to set up three overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| master streams to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| extinguishment. We were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| work from the two engines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| both the north and the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| end is where we were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| set up the large streams and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| begin the extinguishment. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| did that throughout the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Sunday and through the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Sunday and into Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Monday morning we continued the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| suppression operations and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| were actually able to extinguish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| a significant portion on both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| ends. What we couldn't do due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| the fire conditions was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| get to the middle of it, to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| center of it until we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| that extinguished. At that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| we had help from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Metropolitan Moxwell Airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Authority. As the mayor mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| we had two of their crash trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| and what they can do, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| penetrate into a scene a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| further than we can. At that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| point we were able to clear out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| a path for them using a track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| co and a bulldozer to where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| could actually get into the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| of it and start attacking the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| of it, which was a success at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| point. That was actually started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| sometime late Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| afternoon, Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Today we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| continuing extinguishment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| we were able to penetrate even further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| into the center of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| We were able to get some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| heavy equipment in there and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| we're working on right now is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| just moving it pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| a pile at a time, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| what we've been trying to do from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Now we're able to get in there, move it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| extinguish a smaller pile and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| still using the two crash trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| from the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Airport Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| We are making significant progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| now. Obviously there's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| smoke and there will be for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| We're doing our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| to not throw unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| water on it due to the runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| but obviously we have to extinguish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| We're also making some efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| to contain the runoff as best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| we can and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| think that pretty much gets us up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| to date. The one thing I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| mention, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| if I did I'll mention it again, I really want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| to thank our firefighters. They've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| working extremely hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| under difficult conditions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| long hours and we have been rotating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| them out regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| so that they don't get too exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Thank you Chief Sharp. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| I may have skipped the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=671)|
| 0:11:21| Sheriff's Office also took Chief Sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| up in the helicopter so he could have an aerial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| view of the site and so I forgot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| to mention them I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Councilman Dellivolpi. Thank you Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=689)|

| 0:11:37| done by your department in fighting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| fire and all the volunteers. It's great to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| in the volunteer state to see them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| I've got a layman question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| The reality is when you've got this big mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| you've got enough residual heat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| inside the sort of the belly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| of the pile that it reignites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| over and over again. Is that what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| That's right. You can get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| extinguished on top and even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| a few feet down but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| the fire is actually even deeper than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| it either is going to burn itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| down or you're going to slowly put it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| with water or you're going to have to dig it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| out and get that pile moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| It's like these tire fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| we read about although we don't have as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| much toxic material but you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| the same idea that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| you can't really get at the flame. Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Exactly. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you Mayor. I too want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| thank you and all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| people that have participated. I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| over there a number of times just to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| what's going on. Mayor, I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| if this might not be a good time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| for us to really take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| at that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| in terms of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| that's going on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| the new food city and the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| businesses that are along there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| whether or not this is really the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| for that type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| I know I utilize that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| In fact, I was over there Friday picking up mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| but at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| with new apartments going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| and with the businesses, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| maybe Mark can address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| that it might be a time to really look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| entire area as far as development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Well, as I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| when this is over, we're focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| the fire first but we'll be doing a thorough review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| and we'll include that in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| analysis as well. I don't know Mark if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| want to speak to that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| I would just like to express that we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| be happy to work with the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| and any small area planning that would take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Okay. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| I also would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| call on Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| You all might have read that just recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| the KPD fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| solved a 1986| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| murder case. It was a cold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| case for many years. So, Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Yes, we were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| announce yesterday the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| resolution of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| murder of Bobby Hill that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| happened in 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| The original investigation was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| by Investigator Tommy Stiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Of course, Tommy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| passed away last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| but the good news is Tommy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| was able to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| the efforts that we'd put into it most recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| and actually knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| that we were going to have a warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| for the arrest for the suspect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| he initially developed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| case. Unfortunately, in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| cases, sometimes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| takes someone with courage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| to step forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| tell us what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| and be able to testify to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| That is what happened in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| It was solved by Investigator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Jeff Day. Jeff did a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| job of picking up this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| case. He is assigned to the Code Case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Unit. It's a coordinated unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| and Jeff was able to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| with the Code Case Unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| to follow leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| We did have a call. A tip came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| direct their activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| and it paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| We were able to obtain a warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| for first degree murder on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Billy Hill, who was the son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| been alleged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| at this point to have committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| the murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| It's a long time coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| but I think what it shows is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| that law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| will not rest until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| we find the justice for the victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| of these crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| and this Code Case Unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| is a great example of how we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| continuing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| try to resolve all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| It's the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| hopefully of many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| that will be solved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| and Investigator Day did a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| of really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| a lot of hard work on his part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| putting the pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| together to resolve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| case for the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Please express our gratitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| to Investigator Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| and it's interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| that 26 years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| somebody was willing to come forward and give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| us the information we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Yes ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Okay. Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Vice Mayor Pavlos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Thank you Mayor Harrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| I just want to announce that we'll be having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| a workshop this Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| at 5.30 in the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Once again discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| the city pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| and then again on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| in this room at 5.30 again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| we'll be holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| another workshop on the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| Councilman Grave? Thank you Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| Two things I want to report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| First of all I want to thank the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| administration and as well as all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| volunteers and neighborhood groups who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| helped with the discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| that we've had with Chick-fil-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| In fact Chick-fil-A has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| really wonderful in terms of working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| and have agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| an appropriate sign for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| new location in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Everything's worked out well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| and again I just want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| my colleagues and thank you Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1034)|

| 0:17:36| that was talked about back in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1056)|

| 0:17:52| ago, April the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| where we had quite a large turnout in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Knoxville on the idea of a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1078)|

| 0:18:02| property owner and potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1082)|

| 0:18:06| concept plans in front of them and get their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1086)|

| 0:18:10| We got there. We presented the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| and a lot of feedback was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| At this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Mr. Gumpert is working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| his plans. He is taking what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| he's presented, the comments he's heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| looking at the form-based code, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| his commitment is to come forward with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| that meets the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| That's where he says he is, and he's working on that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| and he's not brought anything back to us to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Once again, all any of us have ever seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| yet has been a concept plan. There's been very little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| detail there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| As far as review of the form-based code would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| all of our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| has clearly been involved in reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| the form-based code as we take it on the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Waterfront responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| We are looking particularly at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| at the administrative section of it as we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| figure out how we've had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| change the administration, we've had to change the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1134)|

| 0:18:58| forward developing the Cumberland Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| We also need to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| administration into our codes department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| and maybe not into the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| department, so we're working on reviewing that at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| point in time, and we'll review other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| as they come up along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1150)|

| 0:28:02| 11D is a resolution authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| the mayor to execute an amendment extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1684)|

| 0:28:12| for vehicles and equipment owned by the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| at a fixed factor price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| plus the daily OPIS rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| per gallon until May 31, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| So move. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Yeah, I think if we have Jim York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| and maybe Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| I see Boyce there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Do I understand this correctly that what we're really trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| to do is keep this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| basic vendor in place until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| can go out and procure the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| with another request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| bids? Is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Boyce Evans, Purchasing Agent for the City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Yes, sir, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| And the background on that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| we thought we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| be able to go with a statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| contract for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| But as we really peeled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| onion back more and more and looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| the historical trends, we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| that actually we were getting a better price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| And frankly, more importantly, we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| guaranteed source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| of fuel first in case of emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| with what we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| and the way our contract language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| reads. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| when we finally realized that, we realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| we need a little bit more time to go through the bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| process again and try to get something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| that's more to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| liking than just jumping on the statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| contract. You were going to hitch your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| wagon to a star, the state star,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| and it turned out you guys were the star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Well, frankly, it's usually the easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| and less painless way to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| and they usually have good deals. But this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| frankly, the one we've got going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| is a bit better. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Mike. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1790)|

| 0:33:09| the developers for being so open and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| transparent in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| I've met with about every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| neighborhood group that I could imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| that could have been met with, that could have been affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| They had public meetings. They've reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| and been very transparent and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| have the support of the Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| neighborhood. I believe I can't speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| for the University of Tennessee but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| they're on board with it as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| as the commercial, the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| in and around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| So that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| good way to start and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| this Council and Councils before have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| made it very clear that it's going to be a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| process with something this large so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| commend them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Another thing that I'm excited about for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| is that it cleans up a brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| It's a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| It's been sitting there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| It's an eyesore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| quite honestly and we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| at a minimum eight special weekends a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| where people pull off our interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| and perhaps that's one of the first things they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| and it's just not good. It's not a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| first impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| of the city of Knoxville and the way we're growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| from the center of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| out and then with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| plans that we have for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| of Cumberland Avenue, this is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| anchor tent on the other end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| and it just is the continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| of downtown moving out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| So I think that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| positive thing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| You know, when a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| people when they think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| South Knoxville, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| they just think of the Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| side but I live on the Alcoa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Highway side and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| actually a food desert there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| There's no grocery stores whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| and I live at the furthest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| point in the city that you can live and I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| go ten miles one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| to find a grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| and so other people that live closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| into town even have to go further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| so with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| publics, it'll be a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| addition to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I can go shop and shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| conveniently. It's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| well-respected chain so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| that serves a great purpose there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| as well. But more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| importantly, as we get into the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| aspect of it, where taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| dollars are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| not used, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| think it's very important for people to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| and Bob, Mr. Wetzel, if you wouldn't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| just very briefly explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| what a TIF process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| and what enables this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| to accept that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| or potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| We'll be happy to try to do it very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| It's always a challenge with the TIFs when we get into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| but we'll take a shot at it. I think the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| way to do that is make one statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| up front and just kind of work into the numbers on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| case. An important thing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| understand in a TIF process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| the developers will be taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| out a TIF note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| and they will be the ones responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| for that note. There's no recourse to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| the city in this note whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| They will go forward. They will take out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| what's been discussed as a $10 million TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| note to make needed improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| for the various projects, public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| And so that will be paid back with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| future revenues that are gained from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| this site once it is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| So let's go through just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| little bit how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Currently we have a site that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| appraised at $700,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| It's anticipated that the value of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| at the end of the day will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| $50 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| It's a $50 million project at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| of the day. It's after a $62 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| investment. We're still anticipating a $50 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| So the taxes currently, city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| together, coming in from that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| are roughly $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| The taxes at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| will be roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| $960,000. A huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| increment. There's an increment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| $950,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| that is not being generated today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| that will be generated in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| that will be pledged for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| paying off this TIF note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| So those are the kinds of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Now, during the TIF period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| we will still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| keep 25 percent, roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| 25 percent of the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| increment that's been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| which in our case will come out to close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| So as soon as this project is developed, as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| it's placed on the tax rolls, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| immediately, as a city, start to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| $120,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| of new funds that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| will use for our causes, basically to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| off our past debt. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| what is left, they will use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| to pay the debt that they've incurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| for this project. So we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| from $7,000 a year now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| as a city. This doesn't count city, county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| $7,000 as a city to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| $120,000 as a city. We get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| a $50 million development that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| have the payroll with it, the payroll during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| construction, the payroll after construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| the elimination of the food desert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| and all the other things that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Pavlis just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| There's a clear process on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| You'll find that on Page 10 and 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| of your redevelopment package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| And for your council package, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| 429 and 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| I noticed a lot of pages there this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Does that help, Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| It sure does help. And I think the most important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| of it is that, again, the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| get zero exposure financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| in this project. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| That is correct. The recourse is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| to the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Okay. And then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I'm not sure if Mr. Cullum or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Mr. Seymour, I'd like to know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| payroll will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| build process and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| after the development comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Please state your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Bud Cullum, 6312| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Kingston Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Councilman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I was sitting off to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I think your question was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| payroll amount both during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| construction and the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| And jobs or anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| It's anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| direct jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| on an annual basis of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| 510, indirect jobs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2361)|

| 0:39:29| Direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| wages for the first category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| which is titled Operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| and Annual Results, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| 15.14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| in direct wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| 6.87 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| in indirect wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| State, local, and federal tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| impact for that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| 10.81 million. During the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| construction period, the direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| wages would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| 20.25 million. The indirect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| wages would be 18 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| for a state, local, and federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| tax impact of 9.58| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| million. That was a lot of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| That's what I wanted to hear was a lot of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| That goes directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| back into our economy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| the number of employers associated with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| It's greater than just what you stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| When Mr. Cullum and I met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| with his team, I'm just going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| some eyebrows have been raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| because one of the anchor tenants is a Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And we talked about perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| a target or something, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| just doesn't happen. It's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| And the project would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| work without a Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| and a Publix as the anchor tenants, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I think that's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| I think one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| sometimes people think in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| is that a TIF is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| asked for to subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| rents or operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| for either Publix or Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| And in the case of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| situation, Walmart and Publix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| are both paying absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| top rents that I've heard of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| paying, certainly in this area. Maybe in New| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| York City or Miami they've paid higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| But for the sales justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| that they can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| they're paying the absolute most amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| they can. It's just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| infrastructure cost of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| unique project that is driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| the cost out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| proportion. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| in essence, Walmart and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Publix, as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| owner, we will get a tax bill, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Mr. Wetzel said. We will get a tax bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| for the full amount. And it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| anticipated that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| new value would be right around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| $50 million. We get that tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| bill. We then bill Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Publix, and our other shops on a pro-rata| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| basis. So those tenants are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| effectively paying the full tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| from day one. The increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| after you take out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| the existing part, approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| $14,000 that Mr. Wetzel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| referred to, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| you take out the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| debt service requirement amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| that increment is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| for the period of the TIF to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| us to hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| retire the loan that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| take out and guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Other than that, unless you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| specific questions, I think Mr. Wetzel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| described that way more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| eloquently than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| But I think it is important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| that the taxpayer, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| is the taxpayer not writing a check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| the taxpayer is not taking any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| direct financial recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| And I just did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| a calculation, and I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| interesting to note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| when you take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| $14,000, the city's portion of that tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| right now is approximately right at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| $7,000. And when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| jumps to the $120,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| day one, not at the end of the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| but just day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| immediately we are raising the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| tax and the revenue to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| just in property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| of over 1,600%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| then when you add the fact that we're cleaning up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| the site and that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| needed infrastructure, we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| a home for the Three Rivers Rambler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| the jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| these numbers that I just read off, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| the perfect situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| for the use of a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Well, I do too. And, you know, in closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| again, you know, it's just I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| I'm going to support it, and I hope my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| will support it. It, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| cleans up a blotted area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| a brownfield area. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| great investment by local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| people. This is a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| team. This is not somebody from Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| or Kansas City or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| somebody real smart with a briefcase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| a thousand miles away. These are hometown folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| who have, you know, that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| stake in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| But they are smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| in closing, in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| 18 months, there's going to be right at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| $80 million, if I'm doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| math right, between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| the Hilton Garden Inn that we approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| last meeting, $16 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| there, about $13 to $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| to Cumberland Avenue, and then this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| investment here, and in this day and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| and that short of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| mileage, it's pretty impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Grave. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| As my colleagues know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| we first thought that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| in the second district, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| just want to bring that up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Councilman Pavlis, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| want to echo a number of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Councilman Pavlis said, in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| what I also want to reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| first of all, I'm 100% behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| project, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| would like to think that what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| team did in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| very beginning, that other developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| would take heed. They've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| extremely transparent. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| answered all our questions, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I know also that they've gone to a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| of neighborhood meetings and have met with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| groups, and I just want to commend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| you all on that. I think that's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| for a development like this. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| also, I don't know if you actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| did you address the number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| that are going to come to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| that. If you did, I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| He's older, and he can't hear all of the things you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| There were two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| categories. There was a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| basis, direct and indirect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| of 510| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| direct, 161| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| indirect. There was construction jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| direct, 496| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| indirect, 379.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| And then the direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| wages during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| on an annual basis, direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| wages during construction, indirect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| for both those categories, and the state, local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| federal tax impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Well, I think the other thing that's exciting about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| is not only what you were saying about taking a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| brownfield, but what I was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| at is the idea that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| have more people down in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| area, more people on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| And I know one of the negatives that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| I've heard that I don't agree with is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| the fact that in four or five years, this is going to go dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| And I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| that we're sitting there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| a university population of 25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| people, and we know the university is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| going to go dark. And we have Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Sanders Hospital and all the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| employees they have. And so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| that's not a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| But I really commend you for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| And also, I think from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| an architectural standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| I'm excited about what the building looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| and what it can do. So, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I'm going to support this 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| And thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Councilman Dellivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you, Mayor. Well, I heard so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| congratulatory statements. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I want to add to that. But I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| it's true that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| process has been very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| The public has had a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| participate. And I think that really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| healthy. And that is a good part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| of any development. Certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| this development was handled that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| And I think Bob Wessel's crew deserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| some credit for setting those up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| and trying to engage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| I have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| and they remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| I believe I'm going to support this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| there really are some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| I've heard the rosy side, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| this idea of zero recourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| refers to the note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| they're going to take out in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| support this $10 million TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| TIF helps retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| And I accept that is true, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| the reality is when you build a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| of this size, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| going to be burdens and strains and costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| on this city. They are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| a number of infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| like the access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Joe Johnson Bridge and the ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| that will go with that, like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| intersections over on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Cumberland Avenue. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| I'll be surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| if even with all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| front end looking and engineering, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| aren't issues that the city ends up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| dealing with downstream as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| traffic comes and problems develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| And that will come back to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| That said, almost every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| development has some element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| of that. But zero recourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| shouldn't be taken as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| incantation. I think it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| responsibility that we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| residual. We'll have the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| patrolling that area. We'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| less than 21-year-old students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| standing outside of a Publix hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| someone buys them a six-pack of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| and we'll be enforcing those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| we have standards and rules for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| I am concerned a little bit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| all of the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| seem to ignore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| the sense that there's only so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| demand for whatever is being sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| and there will be strains on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| other businesses. The Kroger's and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| the Whole Foods and the other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| that are dealing with these tenants will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| fewer customers because Nick won't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| to drive as far to get to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| to buy his dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| in terms of this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| it is a very troubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| location and to take it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| is quite daring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| and quite a challenge and I commend you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| for that. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| we need to bear in mind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| not all these jobs will be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Some of them will be shifting demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| and serving the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| population differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Now, maybe more conveniently, and it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| a good thing we don't have university students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| hopping in cars and speeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| down Kingston Pike to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| their groceries. They can be close at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| to where their dorms are and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| their apartments are. I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I guess I'm wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| and I know these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| gentlemen have answered the question, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| wondering why a 25-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| TIF? Why such a long period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| of time? Why not work this out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| five, eight, ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| And the answer I've heard, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| is from Mr. Colum, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| realistically that's the kind of loan you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| to get to amortize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| this kind of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| I can appreciate that. I can accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| that. But it seemed like an awful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| long duration for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| At the end of 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| maybe those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| tax dollars will flow to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| unencumbered by being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| detoured to pay off the loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| via the TIF. But at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| 25 years, maybe those buildings will need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| rehabbed and we don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| their condition will be or what their market will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| be or whether they're in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| So I think we've got to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| with a grain of salt. That said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| what else would pick that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| with the prior industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| use that was there, with the contamination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| I heard someone say the words that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| going to clean up the site, but I think really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| aren't we capping it and containing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| the site? We're covering it in concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| and not disturbing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| solvents that are in the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| And that's a way of preventing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| from escaping into the stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| and into the environment. And that's a plus thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And you said you've worked with TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| and others to do that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| we're not literally going in and remediating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| the site. We're protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| the contaminants from pooching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| out, so to speak, by using concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| A lot of words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| maybe not a big enough point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| but there is some risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| and some cost to the city, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| a very, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| daring project and probably one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| that's got more pluses than minuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| So I am going to support it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| You did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| better than I could. You have my permission to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Talked yourself into it. I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| It's always a challenge going after Mr. Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| I just want to commend the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| on the creativity of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| I've driven by this site just many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| many times in my life and never imagined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| we could have a retail center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| So I just want to thank you on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| and I'm really excited to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| and really hope that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| development community takes notice of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| That we're about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| infill, brownfield development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| And for the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| region, just working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| to protect our green fields, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| is a priority for me and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| I'm really excited about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| and I hope the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| my colleagues are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Yes, I too am going to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| it. I think it's going to be a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| for this part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| with the projects that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| going on there already, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| I hope that the city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| trying to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| the minority-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| business, use of minority-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| women, African| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Americans, Hispanics, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| hopeful that as this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| proceeds forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| which I think it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| that there will be a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| in terms of subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| and whatnot with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| minority-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I just want to echo what my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| I will be supporting this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| but I want to make note of the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| we often hear developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| and others in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| charged with bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| about new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| uses for old buildings, old land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| that, well, we can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| There's a thousand reasons why not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| So I do think this project can serve as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| a model for something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| can happen if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| the determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| the vision, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| a lot of savvy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| go after this. So I will be supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| this. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| One other thing I meant to mention, Mayor, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| several people had called me and said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| well, gee, this is something that the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| ought to buy, and I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| the point that if the university buys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| we have no taxes. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| no income coming from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| And so I think we have an opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| that we should look at very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| in all support. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Looks like there's no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120417?start=3252)|
